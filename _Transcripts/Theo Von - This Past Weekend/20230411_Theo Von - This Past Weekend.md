*  vag, like you almost have to look at it from the bottom. I don't feel like if you're looking [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=868.24s)]
*  directly on, it's like, it could be any age, right? That's true. Yeah. Head on. You don't, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=872.0s)]

*  Right. That it caught her or is her cooter so tight that maybe that's what exploded his brain. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=899.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like it was in the sidewalk. That's how my, I can't say cooter, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. It feels weird. It's just for me too. Yeah, yeah. I could say, it's not bad. That's [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=910.96s)]
*  probably worse, right? I mean, it's all fine. I think, I just think of different places listening, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=917.28s)]
*  you know? Sure, sure, sure. Of different environments. Muff? How do you feel about muff? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=922.72s)]

*  You do go through it. I'm sorry that it's, that looks like it pained you to hear twat. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=941.52s)]
*  I think, I wonder. You have a real distaste for everything but cooter. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=946.56s)]
*  Yeah. I think I do, man. Interesting. I wonder if cooter just sounds more manageable. It sounds [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=951.36s)]
*  like an animal you're trying to hunt. It's cooter for sure. Like, it could be, it could be a, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=958.72s)]
*  like a Pixar character could be named cooter. There he is. Look at her. Cooter. Cooter. That's [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=962.64s)]
*  awesome. Yeah. No. And she has on heels, you know? Yeah, of course. Like a squirrel. Yeah. Like a [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=971.44s)]
*  squirrel in makeup. But then nowadays she comes out on stage and she's like, I'm a man. Right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=976.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Look, cooter named after a pussy. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=984.4s)]
*  Now he's trans. Or she's trans, I guess. A trans squirrel named cooter. That would, honestly, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  that's the odds of that being in a Pixar movie are pretty high. We're going to get a trans [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=998.9599999999999s)]
*  squirrel in a Pixar movie. The odds of that being the next lead in like lethal weapon 11. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1003.68s)]
*  I don't know. Mel might throw his body in front of that. I mean, I guess as long as it's not a [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1012.4799999999999s)]
*  Jewish trans person, he might be down. That's true. Do we know his stance on trans? No, Jews we got. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1016.4s)]
*  That's pretty well documented. I think so. I think we got Mel on Jews pretty nicely. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1022.7199999999999s)]
*  I think you didn't even have to hear his comments. Just watch Passion of the Christ. It's like, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1029.76s)]
*  this is awesome, dude. You learned a whole language, ancient language to be anti-Semitic. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1034.0s)]
*  Because that gives you cover. When you learn the ancient language and bring it back from the dead, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1039.04s)]
*  he's just like, no, no, no, I'm trying to be real. If that was in English, they'd be like, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1043.6s)]
*  Jesus, tone it down on the Jews. But he's like, but you're like, whoa, this is a different tongue. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1047.28s)]
*  It's like, I'm in a different world. I'm in a different place. So respect to Mel for that one. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people, I'm not going to say I bought some of the merch, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1056.72s)]
*  some of the unauthorized merch. Yeah. Yeah. Some of the bootleg Passion of the Christ merch. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1061.76s)]

*  some boats. Actually, the boats are not the problem. Really bring up a couple. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1137.76s)]
*  So you think Amistad was like, just kind of a it was like fictional, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1142.96s)]
*  or it was like a potential reimagining? No, I just think it was like, look, I love Amistad. Yeah. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1147.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I'm just saying it's I think some things are up for interpretation. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1152.48s)]
*  I'd be funny if you thought slavery happened like the way it was in Django, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1158.4s)]
*  if that's the only thing you accepted, because it was like the one where the slaves win. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1162.8s)]

*  said. Yeah. And that's how it happened. And we actually need reparations. You know, that would be [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1176.1599999999999s)]
*  a fun twist on it. Well, the way the world is now, I feel like somebody could see a movie, see a [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1181.36s)]
*  documentary. And that's the I mean, I guess I don't know what they teach in school. So yeah, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=1187.52s)]

*  people would want to see 35 second or 45 second crowd work clips. Like I thought that was, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2728.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, I was like, well, that's not what stand up is. That's not what you want to do. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2735.2000000000003s)]

*  because I was recording every show I did to work on the special. I would watch them back. I was [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2747.6000000000004s)]
*  like, I got to like, try and make this good because it's like, you know, people knew me as like a [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2752.08s)]
*  podcast. They didn't know I was a comedian. So I was working hard on that shit. And then I had all [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2756.3199999999997s)]
*  these like little crowd work moments. I was like, well, these are we'll just throw them away if we [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2760.4s)]
*  don't put them up. Yeah, these are viable. Yeah, we might as well just throw them up there because [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2764.88s)]

*  to steal TikTok's whole shit. Like and so when they whenever they do that, they push all that [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2778.8s)]
*  new stuff. The algorithm just any kind of like little clip like anything pushes it. And and yeah, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2783.84s)]
*  dude. And then people started like subscribing to the channel. And then once you had a little base [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=2791.1200000000003s)]

*  like a like an N-word 16 or something. He was just firing N's and he kept getting closer to me and [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=4988.56s)]
*  like, oh, my God, if this N-word yeller lands on me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. People walked up [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=4998.240000000001s)]

*  When's the last time somebody called you the N-word? That's what you should have yelled at the white people. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5019.92s)]
*  Yeah, then get your shit together. Get your fucking game on. You're not a true ally unless you've been called the N-word [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5023.68s)]
*  recently and I actually kind of believe that too. You want to have friends, you need friends that will call you that. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5029.84s)]
*  It's true and that's what I remember, I think, when I was growing up about the closest thing about [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5038.320000000001s)]
*  there was enough of that where I got called it enough where it was like, OK, I'm around. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5042.56s)]
*  I'm at least in the culture. I can say it now. I'm in the culture. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, you can't. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5045.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you can't say it. Yeah, yeah, but you can think it. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5050.0s)]
*  Well, you can't say it. You can think it with sound. But you can't say it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5056.72s)]
*  Would you do television when you think about that? Yeah, I mean, is that even part of your work? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5067.6s)]
*  Do you even think about that kind of stuff? I think because I love comedy, so it's like I like getting laughs in every way. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5071.68s)]
*  And I do love stand-up. Like, truly stand-up is my first love. I'll never stop doing it, right? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5078.64s)]
*  Like, even when I'm not good at it anymore, it's like I'll do it for me. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5082.400000000001s)]
*  Like, even when I moved to New York, I was like, if this doesn't work, I will be one of those guys that runs a monthly show in his hometown. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5086.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like, just opens at the club. I would never stop doing it. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5093.52s)]
*  But you also, I don't know if you feel this way, like, you can't really talk about certain complex things in stand-up. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5099.04s)]
*  Because at least if you're good at it, you gotta get a laugh every fucking 15 seconds, right? Like 20 seconds, 30 seconds. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5105.04s)]
*  Or you feel like you have to. Yeah, at least I feel like I have to. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5111.04s)]
*  What I like about stand-up, because I don't like when it gets too preachy or pontificatey or any of that shit. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5114.08s)]
*  So, like, that's why I'm interested in, like, movies and TV. Because it's like, you get to be funny in different ways. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5120.08s)]
*  Like, you know, we all have, like, shows we love and, like, movies we love that were so important to us. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5129.04s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, the way I wanted to do stand-up, because I liked stand-up, it's like I want to be funny because I fucking love Eastbound and Down. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5134.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? I want to do my version of fucking Kenny Power. That would be fucking awesome. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5140.64s)]

*  And shit that your stand-up has even, like, touched on. But you can be a little deeper with it if you write, you know. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5150.400000000001s)]
*  Right, you can put something into it. Or you can write a movie, you can write a show. Put something behind it. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=5156.400000000001s)]

*  time letting things go. I'm a grudge keeper. Is that a Greek characteristic? I think it is. Wow. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6154.400000000001s)]
*  I think it is. And like, definitely there's anger problems in my, like that runs in my family. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6159.04s)]
*  Something I'm working on. Like I'm in therapy. For anger specifically? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6163.84s)]
*  Anger is one of the big ones. Yeah, for sure. Anger. I mean, my dad had an anger problem that [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6168.72s)]
*  we all just kind of inherited. And like anger and then guilt also are like my big ones. Yeah. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6172.88s)]
*  Immigrant shit. Guilt is huge, dude. Because it's like your parents are like, well, I came to this [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6179.68s)]
*  fucking country so you would have a better life. Like my dad would drop that. He's like, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6183.76s)]
*  I hate it here. I want to be in Greece. You know, meanwhile, his life would have been dog shit in [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6188.8s)]
*  Greece. But. Right. My dad was crazy. My dad grew up in Nicaragua when he was like 12 or something [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6193.2s)]
*  and they had kids eating dirt, he said, in his jellies and stuff like that. They had kids with [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6198.320000000001s)]
*  like distended bellies. Just worms in their bellies. Yeah. He said from just eating dirt and stuff. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6201.84s)]
*  But then he'd be like, go get me some mayonnaise. You know? And that was it. He never, like, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6206.08s)]
*  he never told me like a lot of stuff. You know, I would just kind of watch him from afar, I guess. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6212.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that makes sense, too, because it's like that's a different kind of immigrant where [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6217.44s)]
*  it's like where you're if you're leaving a place with like they're eating dirt, like you want to be [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6221.84s)]
*  in America. Whereas like, you know, my dad, like, didn't want to be in America. He claimed he didn't [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6226.4s)]
*  want to anyway. Right. You know? But I think both of them sound like they weren't very, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6231.52s)]
*  doesn't sound like your dad's very emotionally open. Doesn't sound like there's a lot of sharing [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6236.16s)]
*  going on. Yeah, I don't think so. And I think you get older at a certain point, you kind of lose the [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6240.08s)]
*  it's almost like you almost have to share your emotions in a certain time period, it feels like, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6244.16s)]
*  because I feel like sometimes maybe I wonder if I wonder if you lose an emotional connection, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6247.52s)]
*  like sensibility once you get past a certain age. I never thought about I never really heard [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6253.04s)]
*  about that. But that'd be interesting. I bet you you relate to things differently. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6257.92s)]
*  Yeah. You know, but I could also see it almost go in the opposite way, where it's like, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6261.52s)]
*  the older you get, you kind of like shed a little bit of that, like, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6265.6s)]
*  who am I even? What am I pretending? Yeah. You know, I definitely feel myself getting a [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6268.96s)]
*  little more open and just more like, like, what a touch with shit, because I'm just like, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6273.6s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. Right. What are these resentments? Yeah, they'll fall away. Yeah, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6278.400000000001s)]

*  month, I had like a stretch where I was on the road, like seven weeks in a row. And the one week I [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6696.5599999999995s)]
*  had off, I had to do a different trip. And it was like just too much. But when it starts, you're [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6702.4s)]
*  like, at least I know what I have to do. There's no ambiguity. Right. There's no think, you know, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6707.44s)]
*  if you're like me, there's like no your own thoughts. You don't even have time to think [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6713.04s)]
*  because it's like, I have to be on the road every weekend. I have to podcast at some point, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6717.2s)]
*  you know, in between that. And then, you know, you have to do fucking YouTube videos where all [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6721.759999999999s)]
*  this other shit. And it's like, there is something freeing to not having to make a decision. But then [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6726.879999999999s)]
*  at the same time, and there's something that feels awesome, where it's all going good, right? You see [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6732.48s)]
*  the fucking the numbers go up and the feeling, you know, feeling of success. But that is a little [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6736.4s)]
*  that that's it. That could be a trap too. Some of the shit you can't have control of. That's the [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6743.12s)]
*  that's the scary thing is like, yeah, you got to kind of put yourself you got to have that vulnerability [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6748.5599999999995s)]
*  with just the person or people in your life or like some other shit that's just not work. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6753.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think when I was a kid, I think I take everything back to when I was a kid. I'm like, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6759.5199999999995s)]
*  I love just, you know, walking through my own haunted house. Of course, of course. Oh, yeah. Oh, [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6763.68s)]

*  why do I need to go have people show me that they see me? And I think comedy, it's like, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6792.8s)]
*  show me you see me in a very real way. It's like, I need proof. I need audible. Yeah, I need to see [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6801.76s)]

*  that's one thing I think about if somebody's laughing, it's kind of if they're genuinely [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6812.320000000001s)]
*  laughing, it's undeniable. Absolutely. So it's like, I need I don't trust things enough in the [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6816.0s)]
*  space that I'm in or in the like home space I'm in that I need undeniable proof that you see me. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6820.8s)]
*  Absolutely. And it has to be almost from like a cellular level. So that's why it has to be [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6828.08s)]
*  right involuntary. Laughter is the one like involuntary thing where it's like, yeah, you even [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6832.88s)]
*  if you're trying not to laugh, you'll still laugh if it's fun. If something hits you just right. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6838.56s)]

*  OK. Hey, you know, I'm calling. I have I work in a learning center. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6902.0s)]
*  And these past few weeks I've been having there's just been I worked with special ed kids and, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6914.32s)]
*  you know, it's yeah, it's it's a job. It gets stuff done. But recently there's been a kid named [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6923.12s)]
*  James. He has autism and recently he's been trying to sexually assault me. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6930.88s)]
*  And no, I don't really care, but it's more frightening for the other students. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6943.28s)]
*  And the thing is, you know, I know they can't help it and stuff, but every time he does that, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6948.56s)]
*  he just has this look in his eyes, this lustful, evil look, almost like he knows what he's doing. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6956.5599999999995s)]
*  He'll be, you know, he'll be running around. Stop that, James. Stop it, James. Please stop. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6966.32s)]
*  What's he doing? You know, he'll be helicopter in it and it's just [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6973.12s)]
*  helicoptering. And we're a little. Yeah, we're a little afraid for our safety. OK, that's it. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6977.28s)]
*  No way. This isn't fucking real. That's real to me. You don't think that that's real? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6983.92s)]
*  Hell, this kid's pulling his cock out and flipping it around. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6988.64s)]
*  What would you do if you pulled your cock out? [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6991.36s)]
*  I guess I would give it an up and down. I don't know if I'd full helicopter. Maybe that's a that's [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6994.16s)]
*  a size issue. Maybe this autistic kid's got a nice fucking piece and he's really letting it hang. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=6997.76s)]
*  I would go up and down just because the helicopter is not as impressive when there's when the [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7003.36s)]
*  circumference of the helicopter, when it's like a mini, like a hummingbird. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7007.28s)]
*  It's more of a drone. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7015.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I think. Oh, I think the first thing you do if you've already exposed your penis, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7020.24s)]
*  you have to then and then you realize, OK, this is weird. I don't know what to do. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7025.12s)]
*  New emotion. I think you have to spin your penis. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7029.28s)]
*  OK, that's fair. And this kid's doing it on a primal autistic level, too. He's just kind of [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7031.599999999999s)]
*  connected. It's like he's not thinking he's just pulling his dick out. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7036.64s)]
*  Very limbic system. It's like very much. Yes, yes, yes. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7039.92s)]
*  If you are you see this a lot on Nature Channel. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7043.04s)]
*  Yeah. You know, where the monkey will kind of or the the way a monkey uses his penis, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7047.200000000001s)]
*  this kid probably uses his penis. Yeah. Or a grasshopper or something that [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7051.76s)]
*  will or like one of those little like lizards or something. They'll clean off all the area [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7055.4400000000005s)]
*  around him and then they'll make their thing real big like this. They make their little like [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7060.160000000001s)]
*  like a mating like a hat kind of. It's like a part of the back, just like a fake hat pops [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7066.0s)]
*  out behind their head and it's like red and blue. Yeah, yeah. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7071.36s)]
*  But I think everybody has their mating call. And you so you think this kid's [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7075.599999999999s)]
*  pulling his penis out as his mating call? I think what else would it be? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7079.679999999999s)]
*  If you're autistic, you still have that's the thing. I think everybody's got to everybody [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7085.12s)]
*  has primal needs, man. Yeah, it doesn't even matter. I would think, OK, so if you're if he's [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7090.32s)]
*  really this horny, is this dick hard? And once you take this hard, you're not really in the [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7095.759999999999s)]
*  helicopter zone. I wonder if autism can get an erection. Oh, I think they can. You think? Oh, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7100.16s)]
*  yeah. I think they could probably get real nice ones because they're not up in their head. Like [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7106.5599999999995s)]
*  we said, it's limbic. Oh, yeah. I have some anxiety problems. Sometimes my dick's like [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7111.2s)]
*  getting hard because I'm, you know, nervous. Yeah. This kid's not nervous, especially if his dick is [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7115.28s)]
*  out in math class. You know, he's like overridden. Yeah. His dick has overridden his feeble autistic [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7119.44s)]
*  mind. Yeah. And just gotten hard. Like with, you know, this root is square. Yeah. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7126.0s)]
*  I don't think I think this guy's lying, though. It's at least rectangle. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7133.28s)]
*  Yeah. This is a cylinder. What about you think this guy's lying? I think so. He. Wow. It's funny. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7137.36s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't think he was. I could feel a smile on his lips. I could say I could hear the smile on [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7144.96s)]
*  his lips. You could be right. I just feel like if a kid is pulling his dick out in special ed, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7150.88s)]
*  first of all, it happens. There's no way it doesn't happen. Well, it happens in regular ed. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7156.400000000001s)]
*  If somebody tells you you're special, you're definitely gonna pull your dick out. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7162.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel like it's the first thing I would do. So, OK, so maybe, though, but you're not, though. So [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7166.08s)]
*  maybe they've misdiagnosed him. Maybe this is a form of rebellion. Although he claims he's got an [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7170.48s)]
*  evil lustful look in his eyes. And he says he's sexually assaulting him, which means he thinks the [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7176.799999999999s)]
*  kid is trying to rape him or? I think he said the kid has a look in his eyes and the kid is trying to [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7181.839999999999s)]
*  be sexually deviant. Right. But I believe that the kid is just trying to advance sexually. Now, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7186.959999999999s)]
*  let's how about this? Isn't this a perfect place for sex robots? Because you don't want to jack [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7193.12s)]
*  the kid off. That's molestation. Right. Yeah. But if there is a, in fact, sex robots in special, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7199.04s)]
*  in like high school special ed, that might be the place they're most needed. Just get them, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7205.76s)]
*  you know what I mean? Clear their brain. They're up against enough challenges learning how to read [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7212.08s)]
*  already. You don't want them hard, too. They should have you. You should have to milk every [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7216.96s)]
*  special ed kid before you start a lesson. I've actually flipped completely on this. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7222.88s)]
*  I think this is the natural way to deal with this. We need those Chinese dick sucking machines [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7227.52s)]
*  that Jordan Peterson retweeted. I don't know if you saw that. I think you got it. If you bring in [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7232.240000000001s)]
*  robots just for sex. Yeah, I wonder. I don't know. I think you'd almost have to have a parent of a [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7238.88s)]
*  child like this. They would have to sign a permission slip. Right. Sure. That's what I'm saying. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7244.0s)]
*  You can't just, I think, send a robot in there or be like, Hey, who's got 50 cents? You know, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7248.320000000001s)]
*  it's in the hole. Like a gumball machine. You turn it. Because they used to let us all out [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7253.04s)]
*  to get a candy every now and then. You're actually, you know what, that's true. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7260.32s)]
*  The school nurse has to be the practitioner. I think you have to have someone there. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7266.16s)]
*  Because they can't be, because if it was like- But then are you teaching an autistic kid, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7270.24s)]
*  sorry, I stepped on you going. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, please. Are you teaching, I don't know. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7274.32s)]
*  But is it Pavlov's dog? Now are they going to get horny every time they learn and you fact? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7279.04s)]
*  You know, you've taught them to evacuate their nuts before learning. That's a good point. That's [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7283.92s)]
*  again, you might have to do the opposite. You listen all day. We let the robot suck your dick. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7289.92s)]

*  It was in a condom. I can't where this apartment complex goes. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7963.52s)]
*  Let's get some more news. What else is going on out there? I'm trying to think of what I've been [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7969.12s)]
*  seeing. I haven't been. They have this beer, the beer, all this a lot of stuff with trans activism, [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7972.240000000001s)]
*  you know. Shout out to them. Yeah. And it's got to be. But what is it? What is being trans? Yeah. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7977.6s)]
*  I mean, I know it's like, is it? I know it's men or women who want to be the other. Right. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7984.72s)]
*  Yeah. Or they feel stuck inside of the they feel wrongfully convicted. Yeah. I think that's a good [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=7992.320000000001s)]
*  way to put it. Convicted in the wrong body. Right. That's what it seems like to me anyway. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8000.16s)]
*  Although some people just want to go. I'm neither. I'm non-binary. You know, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8006.08s)]
*  I'm throwing on some overalls. I'm just hanging out. I'm getting, honestly, a haircut a lot like [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8011.76s)]
*  yours. That's so many. Yeah. Yeah. But I think Mollet is a pretty nice non-binary look. Yeah. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8016.88s)]
*  Do you think what do you think? Because there's a lot of companies now that are advertising stuff. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8025.76s)]
*  Right. I mean, this is hilarious. Kid Rock. She's fucking chill out. Kid Rock. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8028.8s)]
*  But he's also Kid Rock. I know. You know, [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8034.4s)]
*  I like fucking high as a bush. Have a terrific day. You really showed them buying their shit [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8037.04s)]
*  and shooting it with guns and then basically giving them a giving them an advertisement. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8043.84s)]
*  Like everyone who likes trans people is going to be like, damn, Kid Rock's dumb. I'm going to [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8052.08s)]
*  get some Bud Light. Also, I didn't know this, but Kid Rock apparently grew up rich. He grew up at [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8055.44s)]
*  least middle class. Yeah. His family had a car dealership, I think. Oh, okay. Nice. Yeah. I think [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8065.12s)]
*  the thing about it, I think is that he's the place that he's coming from is, are they trying, like, [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8070.8s)]
*  what is, I just wonder, what is the, is there a business goal of it? Does it seem? I don't think [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8082.5599999999995s)]
*  so. That's what I'm just curious about it. Because it seems like an interesting move. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8088.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See, that's the thing. That's what I think has kind of been blown [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8094.0s)]
*  kind of crazily out of proportion is like, trans people that I know, they just want to be trans. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8098.24s)]
*  Right. They just want to like not be like, kill. Like, because that's the thing, as a, if you're [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8104.24s)]
*  like going M to F, if you were like born a man, you transition to female, it's like, that's like a [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8110.0s)]
*  lot of them, like, become sex workers. A lot of them like get like violence against them, guys who [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8117.44s)]
*  feel like they've been either tricked or like whatever. And it's like, it's like a pretty scary [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8123.44s)]
*  thing to, you know, it's a pretty like tough lifestyle. And they're just like, hey, I just [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8127.839999999999s)]
*  want like, not to be killed and to be like, basically respected and to be able to go to like [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8131.919999999999s)]
*  the doctor. And I just don't, it's such a low percentage of people too. That's what it's crazy [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8136.719999999999s)]
*  to me that we're having this discussion. That's the part to me is interesting. It's such a small [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8142.0s)]
*  And I wonder, are you helping trans people by like, Bud Light? Like, is this the move to help? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8146.0s)]
*  Cause I totally understand what you're saying. Like imagine if you are, if you feel that way, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8153.84s)]
*  right? Imagine if you really feel it, right? Now I think there's a big, there could be a difference [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8158.8s)]
*  between people who really feel it. And also now if they're commercializing it, or if they're [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8164.4800000000005s)]
*  sensationalizing it so much that a mind that isn't sure now adapts to it to like have a cause, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8169.52s)]
*  cause people can grasp onto a lot of causes, right? For sure. And I think like, I think like [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8178.400000000001s)]
*  with any kind of thing that gets a lot of publicity, you will have people that are like, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8184.72s)]
*  just unsure will like reach onto it. And you will have, here's the thing, with anything that gets [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8189.6s)]
*  any traction, you'll get people doing it cynically to get famous, right? But the way that there's [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8195.44s)]
*  like, it's like a one percentage of people are trans, .001 of them are like these weird people [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8200.880000000001s)]
*  doing it for attention. So it's like, that's what is crazy about these discussions is like, [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8208.0s)]
*  for the most part, what we're talking about is like, let people have jobs, you know, like just [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8212.640000000001s)]
*  let them have basic, the way I look at it, right? It was like, just let them go about their lives [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8217.92s)]
*  without facing discrimination and like, who gives a fuck? What do you care if somebody like was born [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8222.88s)]
*  a guy wants to chop their dick off and be a girl? Why does that bother you? And I do find it a little [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8228.88s)]
*  ironic where it's like, especially people that are talking about like, you know, like not to get super [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8235.199999999999s)]
*  political with it, but it's like the States that are very anti the trans shit. It's like, you have [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8240.88s)]
*  people talking about how they want limited government, but then they're like, oh, I have [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8245.359999999999s)]
*  to check your daughters to see if your daughter has a vagina before. Like Florida was talking [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8249.84s)]
*  about a bill where they're tracking girls periods to prove their biological female. It's like, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8255.12s)]
*  like a bracelet or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A whoop strap. Florida. Yeah. Ron DeSantis wanted [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8260.8s)]
*  one around like teen girls. Yeah. Inside of them. And it's like, aren't you supposed to be the one [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8266.48s)]
*  for like limited government, but we're checking girls periods. It's just like, or they made it [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8273.44s)]
*  like illegal to mention a period. It's like, dude, it's fucking crazy. And I'm just like, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8278.16s)]
*  I don't get like I have some friends. I don't understand why it's like if someone's trans, [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8282.88s)]
*  let them be trans. Like I would never be upset at anybody that's trans or like I would be very [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8286.88s)]
*  curious what it's really like. For sure. I would be very curious in today's world. What if someone is [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8293.28s)]
*  like just gay and they see an option to be for clout or just totally straight and season it? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8299.68s)]
*  Because there's such a me. It's such a like, like, you know, a currency out there now that [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8306.4s)]
*  I could see that being some. But I don't say that to diminish it because those people are also [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8311.44s)]
*  diminishing if people are really dealing with that. Like, I don't know, I guess, I guess I just [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8316.16s)]
*  wonder, is this the best person to introduce that to the world? Like, because a lot of people now [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8321.6s)]
*  are just starting to talk about trans, which is maybe is good. But it's such a such a small [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8328.56s)]
*  percentage of people. I guess I just don't understand. Is this going to be helpful to [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8332.64s)]
*  trans people? Because it almost like if I'm a trans person, right, and my life is tough, right? [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8337.599999999999s)]
*  If I really am, if I because I believe that, you know, I mean, you make God makes so many cookies, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8344.16s)]
*  man, you could. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Something could be also merging. You don't know. Yeah. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8349.439999999999s)]
*  And I also think in like other societies, like ancient ones, people were kind of like [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8354.8s)]
*  in between genders and other societies had like multiple genders. Yeah, look at Robin Hood. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8359.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Those guys were in tights. Come on. You tell me somebody somebody threw on [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8363.76s)]
*  made Marion's dress. Big John was a bear. Yeah. But I just want I guess I wonder if I say like a [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8369.12s)]
*  regular trans person who does not want the wild attention, right. And who just is trying to figure [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8376.240000000002s)]
*  out their thing. Do they think that this is I wonder if this is feels comfortable to them, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8382.720000000001s)]
*  that now it's this thing. It's like attached to be it's like. Yeah. I don't know. I know you mean [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8387.76s)]
*  like it's become like a like well, anytime like advertising or whatever, you know, when you become [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8392.64s)]
*  super mainstream. But I think a lot of the attention is unwanted, I think for the most part. But I do [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8399.84s)]
*  think it's because it's a kind of a political backlash because I think I think what I don't want [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8404.800000000001s)]
*  to get fucking super political here, right? Yeah, maybe we are getting but but but there is something [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8411.44s)]
*  to a culture war thing where conservatives have been very shrewd, starting with like Karl Rove, [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8415.36s)]
*  where it was like they it started with gay marriage, right. And it's like, because people [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8421.76s)]
*  are like, like shit sucks in America for a lot of poor people. But I think when you don't when you [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8427.2s)]
*  don't want to offer poor people anything in terms of like material help in terms of like better [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8434.0s)]
*  schools, better, you know, health care, like health care is a big issue, right? Like people are fucked [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8438.960000000001s)]
*  and everything's getting more privatized and there's less like support. I think the way that [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8443.68s)]
*  you that you get people to like vote for you is you like rile them up and scare them, whether that [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8448.4s)]
*  and like there's this big backlash against trans people because I think it's become a conservative [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8455.28s)]
*  boogeyman where they're talking about like, you know, drag queens and they're talking about how [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8459.52s)]
*  drag queens are going to like groom your like they're calling gay people groomers and shit. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8463.6s)]
*  And I think that's really dangerous. And I think that attention has come because trans people are [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8467.68s)]
*  being used as a political tool in the negative, whereas like, I mean, dude, it's so funny to hear [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8472.08s)]
*  people talk about how drag queens are like, you know, oh, they're so dangerous for kids where it's [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8479.36s)]
*  like drag queen like you think they molest people like politicians and priests are up [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8484.96s)]
*  2 million kids to zero on the less the drag queens. It's like maybe like a thousand. Yeah, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8491.28s)]
*  maybe there's one. Yeah, there's one of them who was whatever. But it's like still drag queens [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8497.52s)]
*  are going to start having to do like flea flickers and like trick plays to get back in the game. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8501.76s)]
*  Yeah, priests. Fucking compared to politics. They're the ones fucking kids. And it's like it's [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8506.800000000001s)]
*  just become this political ploy, you know? Yeah. Like, yeah, I mean, look, that's a that's a really [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8512.48s)]
*  great point, man. I think what I hear a lot of times that people are scared of, especially on [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8517.76s)]
*  the backs of like the vaccine and stuff like that. People are scared that, well, is this some another [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8521.92s)]
*  reach where they're trying to where the media will then use like a lot of like film television [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8529.28s)]
*  exposure about gender uncertainty and then to start to get you young people to want to take [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8537.12s)]
*  like a gender blocker, right? Or some type of medicine, right? And I don't know enough [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8546.8s)]
*  about the medicine. Yeah. But I think as when I look even how influenced I was when I watched [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8550.64s)]
*  WWE wrestling. Yeah. If the rock cut his dick off, you'd be thinking about it, dude. If somebody [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8556.24s)]
*  threw my grandmother against the if somebody just threw my grandmother against the ropes. Yeah. I [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8561.359999999999s)]
*  would have kicked that bitch's head off. That's how influenced I was. But yeah, it was over, bro. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8565.76s)]
*  No amount of calcium pills was going to bring her back. Yeah. So I think that's a lot of people's [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8575.92s)]

*  a lot of people are skeptical about the vaccine now? And rightfully so. Yeah. So I think that's [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8592.32s)]
*  probably a lot of I think that's a lot of the fear. Yeah. But I think the molestation part, [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8596.72s)]
*  you're right. It's like, yeah, it's like, oh, you can't molest my kids. I'll let them, you know, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8601.44s)]

*  that the numbers are that big where it's like, all of a sudden, all these kids are transitioning [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8617.36s)]
*  because they think it's cool. I think it's so hard to do that. Like, people would say that about like [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8622.4s)]
*  in like sports, right? Or like Leah Tom, they were talking about that swimmer who like was [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8627.36s)]
*  trans and was like a much better swimmer as a woman than than she was a man. The idea that you [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8631.92s)]
*  would cut your dick off to win fucking college swimming, you really want to you really want that [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8637.92s)]

*  be weighing you down. Sure. You're a seal. But it just like I guess I'm not convinced that like [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8654.8s)]
*  I think a lot of this shit is just fear mongering for no reason. Yeah. Especially when you see the [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8659.599999999999s)]
*  statistics. Like I saw some poll. I don't know. I don't know if like we can find it. But it was [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8663.519999999999s)]
*  like there's like a poll of shit of like the percentage people thought were trans, a bunch [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8667.519999999999s)]
*  of things, not just trans, but like a ton of stuff like right. How many people are Muslim in America? [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8672.64s)]
*  How many people are like get whatever? And everyone overestimated everything. And that like I think I [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8676.48s)]
*  literally think like a percentage of trans people in America is like like one percent. I think we [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8682.8s)]
*  looked up the other day. It was one point seven million about five percent of young adults in the [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8686.72s)]
*  USA. Their gender is different from their sex. See now this article sounds so delusional to me, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8689.759999999998s)]
*  right? Five percent of youth. It could be now that could be they asked a hundred youths in Brooklyn. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8694.32s)]
*  Yeah. Outside, you know, but that's the thing about articles. You just don't know. But that [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8700.72s)]
*  kind of percentage. Yeah. You see that it could definitely make people think what's going on. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8705.519999999999s)]
*  And then you get scared. Why is it so scary, man? I also think there's a difference between [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8710.64s)]
*  like fully transitioning and being like, hey, I do think there's a lot of kids who are like, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8716.16s)]
*  hey, maybe I'm non-binary. Yeah. I'm like, I'm not going to change anything medically, [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8720.32s)]
*  but like maybe I'm going to start sort of being called Eric. My name is now sock. Yeah. And I'm [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8724.64s)]
*  half a guy. You know what I mean? Like like it is there is like there is some change in that. I [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8730.24s)]
*  think definitely I think I have more like young friends who are like maybe open to experimenting [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8735.44s)]
*  with gender in that they think, you know, the way every generation has different radical ideas to [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8741.76s)]
*  older people. And I think that's another thing I try and think about is like, you don't want to be [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8747.76s)]
*  the old guy who's like, well, that's not right. That's not how I had it. Yeah. You know what I [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8752.08s)]
*  mean? Like the part of me is like, I defer to young people sometimes a little bit where it's like, [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8756.0s)]
*  and some of this is like, people are going to find themselves and they're going to like settle down. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8760.4s)]
*  And it's like, whatever they might, those percentages might like drop or whatever. But [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8763.76s)]
*  it's just like, I think this shit is kind of like fluid and like always changing. But ultimately, [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8768.56s)]
*  I don't think it's dangerous. Like that's the thing. It's like, who gives a fuck if somebody [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8775.84s)]
*  wants to change their name or like be perceived as something else. I don't understand why you [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8779.84s)]
*  fucking care. Yeah. Oh, I don't, I don't think I feel like a lot of people probably don't. Yeah. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8785.36s)]
*  But I think if it came to a point where then a kid could go get, say if I'm 14, right? Yeah. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8789.84s)]

*  just don't like me, bro. I mean, there was times when I was younger, when I thought that women [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8800.880000000001s)]
*  didn't like me enough that I thought maybe I'm supposed to like men. Dude, me too. I was like, [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=8805.6s)]

*  and we are different in ways that are cool, like that's even going back to what I was saying about, [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10380.720000000001s)]
*  it'd be cool to have somebody from a different culture in my family, like I feel like I have [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10384.400000000001s)]

*  time when I'm with people different from me. Oh yeah, do you ever get the nuggets and they [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10391.76s)]

*  I like when crowds are different from, like I like seeing people that I have nothing, like [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10405.68s)]
*  that you wouldn't think it's just some like bro, like older couples have started coming to my shows [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10409.76s)]

*  experiences, even on my podcast, it's like, let me get some gay dudes, you know what I mean, [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10424.24s)]

*  people that are different than you and just kind of like soak all that shit up and, you know, [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10443.44s)]
*  have a good ass time, eat some different foods, suck some different colored nipples. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10447.76s)]
*  They should have gay foods. Yeah, what would be a gay food? I think a clear, anything that [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10451.92s)]
*  easy on the old butthole, I think like a clear broth. Yeah, that could be part of the barbapho, [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10459.84s)]
*  it's like just a clear broth for our gay friends. Yeah, dude, I just want to, it's so interesting [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10470.320000000002s)]
*  to think like, what is history going to be like? But it's interesting with cult with ethnicity, [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10478.480000000001s)]
*  because we truly only win as a people, right? If we all win, right? That's the only way that [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10482.48s)]
*  like humanity, if you hope that a thousand years or whatever it is, that everybody, [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10489.6s)]
*  that's why sometimes I think it's almost like different ethnicities and cultures have like [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10497.039999999999s)]
*  different parts of like the, whatever is going to bring everybody to peace. Yeah, we got to be Voltron. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10500.48s)]
*  I mean, I do think you're right in terms of like, it's got to be like a collective thing. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10506.16s)]
*  Like people realize like, I think most people, I think America is held down a little bit by like [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10509.92s)]
*  the richest in our country where it's like, shit is hard, you know, the inequality is crazy. They [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10515.12s)]
*  have a lot of resources, like, you know, these motherfuckers have islands, and it's like people [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10520.960000000001s)]
*  don't have fucking water. And it's like, or, you know, people can't like, don't have a living wage, [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10524.960000000001s)]
*  or like you look at how Walmart treats their fucking workers, they're busting their asses. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10530.24s)]
*  And it's like, they're on fucking food stamps. It's like, you got, yeah, it's like, come on, [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10534.4s)]
*  and so I do think there's like a collective thing where it's like, if everybody realizes [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10538.96s)]
*  that there's a few people fucking our shit up, you could, you know, there is like, [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10542.48s)]
*  there is like, you know, that's why I think like labor unions are good, where it's like, [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10546.08s)]
*  you can just be like, hey, we do all the fucking work, like, you should just, you know, have to like, [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10548.88s)]
*  there's this weird thing where it's like, even like child labor is back in certain places. Like, [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10554.24s)]
*  that's how much they don't want to pay people a living wage, that they're like, they're rolling [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10558.8s)]
*  back like child protection laws. It's kind of fucking wild, dude. Wow. But I didn't know that. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10563.04s)]
*  Yeah, there was a couple, there's a couple of states that they just started doing that shit, [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10568.0s)]
*  and it was fucking, it was fucking crazy. But I do think that it's, it's fat. Yeah, [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10570.8s)]
*  it's like, how can people survive on these on, on, on, on wages, you know? Yeah. No, it's fucked up. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10574.32s)]
*  It's also like, some jobs are like stair step jobs, like to advance and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10580.4s)]
*  for some people, maybe they're not these days. It's just, it's, it's, it's child labor laws are [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10585.44s)]
*  under attack in states across the country. Amid increasing child labor violations, lawmakers must [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10590.0s)]
*  act to strengthen standards. Yeah, they're like, and they're just, even the laws that we have on, [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10594.0s)]
*  on file, they're just kind of like ignoring them and shit. It's kind of crazy. I think we're in a, [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10598.8s)]
*  we're in like, I think- Feels lawless right now. Shit is kind of crumbling. And it's like, [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10603.04s)]
*  like we even are like basic shit. It's like the infrastructure in this country sucks dick. Yeah. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10607.76s)]
*  The roads are bad. Amtrak? Yeah, it's like, yeah. I mean, don't get me started on that shit. But I'd [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10613.12s)]
*  rather FedEx myself somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Put me in a, poke some holes in a box. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10618.0s)]
*  Easy. Yeah. Which sucks too, because in this country, there used to be so much rail, [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10624.4s)]
*  but that was, I mean- Amtrak was fun as fuck. Dude, that's the other thing. It's like, when you go back [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10628.16s)]
*  in time and you look at history, it's like car companies destroyed rail in this country. But then [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10632.56s)]
*  they let them lobby against it so that they could, so that it wouldn't even be competitive. You know? [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10638.08s)]
*  I just wonder also, are we sitting on the down or do we get to a point where greed and in that sort [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10642.96s)]
*  of thing has happened so much that it's like, this is where you end up? Absolutely. I think that's the [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10647.84s)]
*  logical end of like always putting profits over everything. It's like, I'm not saying you shouldn't [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10654.24s)]
*  make a, you know, you shouldn't make a living. You shouldn't make a profit, but it's like, there is [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10659.28s)]
*  something fucked up when it's like, that's the only goal. I think you make a good living, you have a [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10663.04s)]
*  product that makes a good amount of money. You should also pay your fucking work. Like I have a [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10667.44s)]
*  problem with Amazon, but if Amazon just took some of their profits and paid their fucking workers [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10671.84s)]
*  better and made sure they all got like health insurance and shit and be like, that's the best [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10677.36s)]
*  company. Well, now their profits would be a little worse, but it's like, I think you could, that's, [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10681.36s)]
*  it should be a twin goal of like make profits and provide for the people that like work for you and shit. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10687.2s)]
*  But yeah, it's interesting. It's like, there's a lot, it's like, cause you ask somebody who's a business [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10693.04s)]
*  partner and they'll, you know, they'll say, like Mike Rowe was on here and he said, well, people just [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10697.84s)]
*  don't want to do jobs. They don't want to work anymore. It's so, and there can be an article that's [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10702.16s)]
*  created to kind of make you think anything. Of course. That's the scariest part. It's like, [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10706.48s)]
*  and to not know, like we don't, you know, we know our instincts, right? Yeah. But yeah, I think it's [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10710.88s)]
*  unbelievable that there's, that there are, they should put a cap on wealth, I believe. I, I'm with [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10718.24s)]
*  you actually fully, like when you look at like the, like how we got out of the great depression and [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10723.68s)]
*  shit and all that kind of stuff, it's like after a certain point, it's like, you look, it could be a [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10728.88s)]
*  crazy enough, $20 million a year, whatever. It's like after a certain point, it's like, okay, tax [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10733.84s)]
*  that rate high and then fucking provide basics for people. Yeah. You know, and it's like, and it [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10738.56s)]
*  doesn't have to be like poverty, like it doesn't have to be like no one's allowed to make any money, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10744.16s)]
*  but it's like, it's, I do think it's in, it's like a moral issue in America that we have so much [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10748.32s)]
*  homelessness and so much of it is like fucking people that were in the army, you know, it's like, [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10753.28s)]
*  it's shit and like how much teachers make. It's like, why the fuck is a, is a teacher getting [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10758.0s)]
*  paid $34,000 a year, but like a consultant, you know what I mean? Like some fucking fake job [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10762.72s)]
*  where they tell you to like, oh, slash prices to make more profits. Why do they make $200,000 a [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10769.199999999999s)]
*  year or whatever? It's like, that's the shit where I'm just feel like, I don't feel like a very [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10774.8s)]
*  political person, but it's like, when I start talking, it sounds like, it sounds like I'm a [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10778.96s)]
*  fucking communist, but I'm just like, no man, just like we should provide for the weakest in a society [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10783.76s)]
*  when we have so much money and that's, that's like my belief is that like, yeah, we should just [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10790.0s)]
*  provide for, for like people. And I think you see it with like, you know, you still want people to [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10794.96s)]
*  work. You still want that, right? But then like, it's, you know, I don't know. It's, there's a lot [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10800.24s)]
*  of, there's a lot of like nuance to all of it, but I don't think that, but then also you have people [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10806.4s)]
*  that'll go and have 20 kids and they don't have any social responsibility to the fact that [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10813.6s)]
*  when you do that and have no plan or anything that the drain you're putting on society is [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf4jzf0-VU&t=10819.839999999998s)]
