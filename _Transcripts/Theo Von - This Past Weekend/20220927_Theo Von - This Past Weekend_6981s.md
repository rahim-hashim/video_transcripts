*  Rat King Racing over there. If you like racing, getting speeding tickets or doing IndyCar, NASCAR. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6.32s)]
*  Hell, if you like to damn tickle your Uber driver, if you like to tickle him, damn, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=14.32s)]
*  I need to tickle my throat and get these dang words out, you know? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=22.72s)]
*  But if you like to do all that, head on over there, theovonstore.com, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=26.48s)]
*  and we got that racing gear for you. Today's guest is returning to the show for his second time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=30.0s)]
*  He is, his life has changed a lot since then. When I met him, he was, you know, living out of a trunk [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=37.2s)]
*  or something. I'm not a Trump. I don't know where he was living. I don't know. He was alive, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=43.04s)]
*  but he was probably, who knows? He could have been selling hair. He's a good man. I'll say that. And [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=47.6s)]
*  he hosts one of the most popular and unique shows in the universe, Sunday Conversations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=54.08s)]
*  And he's part of Barstool Sports. And he is, he is one of a kind. I'm grateful to have him back [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=64.24s)]
*  now that his life has just really expanded so much. He's my friend. And I say that honestly, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=72.48s)]
*  Mr. Caleb Presley. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=79.28s)]
*  Shine that light on me [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=82.16s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my stories [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=87.84s)]
*  Shine on me [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=92.8s)]
*  And I will find a song I will sing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=97.36s)]
*  Caleb Presley. Theovon. Theovon. Theovon. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=108.39999999999999s)]

*  Caleb Presley. Man, thanks for coming back. Do you know, this is your second time coming on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=118.0s)]

*  producing podcasts and doing some of his own stuff and betting online. Yeah. And spending time [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=144.8s)]
*  with his grandmother. Yeah. Well, as you should, they probably are betting together. Yeah. I think [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=151.84s)]
*  actually I did one of the picks he sent me, I did see, I think some slots in the back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=155.28s)]
*  Yeah. What's going on, man? Dude, I'm your neighbor. Yeah, that's true. For a while. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=162.56s)]
*  You moved out here to Nashville. How's that been for you? It's been good so far. I haven't been [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=167.04000000000002s)]

*  have been on. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, so I was like, all right, this one I'm gonna do. I'm gonna, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=516.56s)]
*  and this is when he was not coaching. He was just doing his football show. All right. I was like, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=522.64s)]
*  I'm going to do a segment. And in hindsight and saying out loud, it sounds dumb. And it was, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=526.08s)]
*  I'm like, I'm just going to find them. Finding John Gruden. Like just find them. And there was no [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=531.36s)]
*  like, there was no like find them and then I'm gonna, it was like, I'm just going to find them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=537.52s)]
*  And so anyways, I was like doing all this research, talking to people who knew. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=542.8s)]
*  Replying to Bucks fans, DMs. Yeah. So I was like, I was like, I'm gonna find this guy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=546.16s)]
*  Anyways, I ended up in Tampa and they're like, he is headquarters is in the Hooters, the original [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  Hooters. Oh wow. Like that's where he runs his show from. That's where he shoots his show. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=562.0s)]
*  And so it was like, all right. So I went to the original Hooters. I was at the restaurant [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=568.24s)]
*  and it's in Tampa and I was eating. I was like, you guys seen John Gruden recently? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=572.56s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, every day. I was like, well, where's his office? It's in here, right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=575.76s)]
*  They're like, oh no, no, no, it's in corporate. Like, and that's corporate right across the street, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=581.2s)]
*  across the parking lot. Wow. So you're there, huh? And did you wear something nice? You just [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=585.28s)]
*  wore just regular clothes. Yes. We're regular clothes. Wow. It's cool. Early in my career. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=588.88s)]
*  Yeah. I wasn't even at the close stage of your career. And I walked across the street and I [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=592.8s)]
*  went into the corporate office and I was like, I'm here to see John Gruden. And by the way, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=600.56s)]
*  corporate office of Hooters. Okay. And damn bro. That's the corporate office too of the world. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=605.12s)]
*  When you think about it, it's the corporate office of every 11 and 12 and 13 and 14 and 15 year old [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=613.04s)]
*  boy. I mean, I still got my hat on. And this was, I didn't even know we were telling the story today. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=617.92s)]
*  But anyway, so I, maybe them tits boy. I also hosted the Hooters conference this year or the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=623.04s)]
*  pageants. We can talk about that later. But so I go in there and I was like, I want to see John [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=628.48s)]
*  Gruden. They just took me back. Like, well, take, take to his office. He wasn't there, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=634.0s)]
*  but his assistant gave me a tour and he's like, what are you looking for him for? I said, oh, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=638.32s)]
*  I don't even remember what I said. Oh, it was here to see him. You know? And so show me around the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=642.48s)]
*  office. This is where they shoot this. This is where he does this. And they're like, this is, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=649.92s)]
*  John Daly's room. And I was like, what do you mean John Daly's room? And they're like, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=654.32s)]
*  and they open it up. It's a, you know, like the Chronicles of Narnia, a wall that has a bunch of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=660.08s)]
*  books and you can push it open. Yeah. It was literally that you push it open and it was just [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=665.6s)]
*  a very small room, smaller than this room. And it had a mattress on the floor and like a little [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  putting thing. And I guess John Daly lives in there inside, inside John Gruden's office, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  inside the Hooters headquarters. And they say he parks his bus out back and then whenever he just [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=682.32s)]
*  needs a place to be outside his bus, he goes in there. Oh wow. So he goes and stays in a bus also. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=688.4s)]
*  Yeah. That's almost the most homeless shit you can do. I feel like, like live in a Hooters and live [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  in a, like be in a bus, but I guess if you love living in a bus, dang. And so did it have like a [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=698.48s)]
*  sink or anything in there? Yeah. I think it's probably just cause people get so, I mean, if [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=702.88s)]
*  you're trying to carry him back, you know, you want to walk up the stairs onto the bus. So sometimes [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  probably just easier if it's a smaller person, he's at the restaurant with small people, maybe [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=710.4s)]
*  he's eating Chinese or something. Yeah. It's taken right into the lame on the ground. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=713.68s)]
*  Damn. I can't believe that dude. See, that's a good top secret way to go about business. A lot [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=718.64s)]
*  of businesses, I feel like think too much, like let's put the business in this big business, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  you know, Applebee's. Yeah. They're like, Oh, every time you go in, you know, whoever, you know, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=727.68s)]
*  everybody's doing Applebee's bro. But it'd be crazy as fuck if you look under like a table or you move [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  a booth and there's like a marathon gas back in there. So yeah, there's just a big computer, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  John Gruden Gmail. Damn dude. I'm wondering if that's where he was sending those wild emails [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=741.92s)]
*  from. I don't even really know what he said, but apparently it was bad. Dude, I got a wild story [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=748.88s)]
*  like that. So one time I went over to, there were some dudes, man, two white guys, one of them wasn't [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=753.28s)]
*  white. And we went over there and it was about business, right? Yeah. So I go over there and, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  uh, and I'm ready for business or whatever. And it was like a business meeting. So anyway, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=768.8s)]
*  they said, Hey, it was in like the Hollywood Hills somewhere and like, Hey, do you know this is, um, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=775.84s)]
*  Jared Leto's house, right? No way. And I was like, really this Jared Leto's house? And, um, and so [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=783.28s)]
*  next thing you know, there's a bunk, there's like, Oh, they're like, you want to see something cool. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=790.48s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, you know, I'm here for business. Yeah. You know, so they open up like, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=794.64s)]
*  it looks like a huge refrigerator door from like the Dharma initiative or something from lost. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=799.92s)]
*  Yeah, right. They open it up and it's like a hallway from like the 1930s or something. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=804.56s)]
*  His house was part of the property was a bunker, like a war bunker that was like built into like [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=811.52s)]
*  a hill. And we walked back in there, bro. It's like walking back in time. You're like in like, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=818.8s)]
*  it was like a 19, like third, fourth, fifties hospital or something. There's, um, there's like [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=824.8s)]
*  a cafeteria and that was insane, bro. There was like 70,000 square feet of bunker and then like, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=830.56s)]
*  probably like a nice 4,000 square foot house, you know, like, but the amount of bunker that he had, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=839.8399999999999s)]
*  I can't even imagine, bro. If it's like, I got two questions. One, do you think you're [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=845.76s)]
*  getting in trouble for saying that? I don't know with who the military. Yep. Well, I didn't even [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=849.92s)]
*  think about them just with him and to what business meeting was it? I hope not. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=855.6s)]
*  I don't think the military will care. What kind of business meeting were you doing at Jared Leto's [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=862.24s)]
*  house? Uh, I don't remember. It was like, I've heard some stories. I'm not sure it was a business [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=866.16s)]
*  meeting. Really? He wasn't there. Oh, really? It was two other, he had a couple of little land [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=870.64s)]
*  sharks. They were a couple of, you know, employees, coworkers. You probably gotta work your way up [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=875.84s)]
*  before you can even meet him or see him. Well, years later I met him. Oh really? Yeah. Now we're [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=880.16s)]
*  like, you know, buddies, you know, uh, like not friends, but like, you know, like text and say, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=884.3199999999999s)]
*  Hey, and I see him at the UFC fights. Do you watch his movie Morbius? I went to the premiere. How was [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=889.76s)]
*  it? I don't think those are my kind of movies, you know? Well, me neither. I didn't see it for [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=894.56s)]
*  that reason. It was, I mean, I'm actually a huge fan of his, but, uh, yeah, I didn't watch it. Um, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  and I didn't like bats, you know, we didn't have a lot of, uh, I don't think we had a lot of bats [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=907.1999999999999s)]
*  growing up around our area. And so I didn't really know anything about bats. And so I think a lot of [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=912.16s)]
*  it, I was trying to just figure out what bats get the whole concept of it. Like what are they? Yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=917.1199999999999s)]
*  Why are they? Yeah. Yeah. Did I tell you maybe you would hate what Batman? Oh yeah. Have you seen [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=923.1199999999999s)]
*  that did the whole thing? I don't want to spoil it. The whole thing's like bat centric. Oh, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=934.0s)]
*  is you probably get some more explanation and clarity on like what it is, but you really [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=940.16s)]
*  probably would not like it at all. You know, there's shit you can light it on fire. That's [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  what I read somewhere. The bat, um, droppings or whatever, or you could light it on fire. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=947.92s)]
*  That's just a myth. I don't know what, you know, I don't know if that could be true. Yeah, I don't [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=956.24s)]
*  know. But anyway, so yeah, but I wonder if John Gruden works in there, that little bunker, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=958.9599999999999s)]
*  that would have been crazy if he was in there. Do you think they have a staff in there? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=963.68s)]
*  I don't know, man. I mean, I know he, he, like his band, they do like some pretty wild parties. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=967.76s)]
*  Bring up a 30 seconds to Mars party. I think it's called 30 seconds to Mars. You just kind [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=973.04s)]
*  of hear stories, but I mean, I don't know. I've never met him and it seems like kind of a different [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  life than definitely I live and probably you too is what they're kind of doing. Um, he's very [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  beautiful. You almost, he's, he has, he kind of embodies like woman, man and child in one. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=989.04s)]
*  You almost don't know if you want to put them on a school bus or like, uh, you know, or, um, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=994.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, he seems like he's always in a wedding kind of, he kind of has that vibe. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=999.6s)]
*  That makes sense. Yeah. I don't know why. There was a, it did make sense. They do some real fancy [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  parties. Um, him and his brother, he's from Louisiana. Dude, there's nothing like just, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1009.2800000000001s)]
*  it gives you the feel of a concert, like reading an article. I'm like trying to read this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1016.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm like trying to read this. No, I've seen though. I mean, I've seen, I mean, it's, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1023.1999999999999s)]
*  yeah, they do some exotic. Well, he's like, uh, you know, a cult leader and stuff like that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1027.9199999999998s)]
*  are excused of it. And I don't know if that's, I don't think it's bad. Yeah. But sounding on [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1032.08s)]
*  the cues maybe is a harsh word. Like he, he's like, someone made a rumor and he was a cult leader. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1036.72s)]
*  First of all, if I'm a cult leader, good for me. I feel like, right? Yeah. I hate how they're [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1044.56s)]
*  always like, oh, this fucking cult leader, you know, or whoever, you know, or like whoever it is, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1051.6s)]
*  Billy Graham or like Mike Lindell or whoever these people are, you know, like, uh, who the guy that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1056.08s)]
*  did the XFL, you know, all that shit, but it's like, if I'm a cult leader, I'm fucking, let's do it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1062.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. What would you do for your cult? What would you have them do or what do they need? What do you, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1070.56s)]
*  someone needs to do? Like once they're in, how do you maintain your membership? I think sex mostly. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  You seem like you, you're right on the same page as pretty much everyone else. I think. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1081.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the only reason you get into a cult, I feel like [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1084.72s)]
*  it's probably for some kind of light sex, you know? I don't know. We had a guy one time on here who [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1088.5600000000002s)]
*  beat, what's that? He has like a disease or something where you can't talk. Uh, he had a stutter [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1095.44s)]
*  and he, he was in, um, he was in that XMV cult. Yeah. XIV, the one that they busted the guy. Really? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1104.32s)]
*  Yeah. And then what happened with his stutter? It went away. They cured it though. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1114.32s)]
*  So that did it come back after or no, he didn't have it when I saw him. Really? You know, it could [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1119.52s)]
*  have flared up later. I don't know, but he, uh, I just believe if there's enough people around you, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1124.0s)]
*  fucking dude, it can heal diseases. I think you see that story about, have you been watching House of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1128.9599999999998s)]
*  Dragons? The new Game of Thrones show? I watched the first one and I got, I couldn't understand [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1132.72s)]
*  what was going on. So I'm gonna start over. They said, I mean, I just read an article is like, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1136.32s)]
*  they have a scene in a brothel. Again, no spoilers, but there's a scene where they're in a brothel [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1142.4s)]
*  and, uh, the main actress was like, they had extras in there who met each other that day, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1147.04s)]
*  who had to 69 for 14 hours on set that day. Really? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1152.4s)]
*  Okay. This is my question for you then, man. If you throwing out some real gas out here, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1156.4s)]
*  uh, would you rather be the person on the top or on the bottom? You think bottom? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1161.12s)]
*  Cause you're kind of relaxing. Yeah. Yeah. You're chilling. Yeah. You could rest. I bet they made [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1167.92s)]
*  them switch like every half hour, but no, cause continuity. Oh yeah. Yeah. You get deep into [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1174.32s)]
*  editing, you find out that they had to stay exactly the same spot. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1180.08s)]
*  Yeah. And probably doing the same thing too. It's not a joke, dude. They probably had to [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1183.2800000000002s)]
*  literally, cause they're doing the same shot over and over and they have to have, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1186.8000000000002s)]
*  they switch angles. The people in the back had to be doing the same thing. So if you're [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1190.8000000000002s)]
*  doing this and you, you gotta do the same speed, 12 hours, 69 is for children. I think it's hard. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1193.68s)]
*  As you, the older you get, it's harder to do. Yeah. You know, I've always thought that 69 is [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1200.8000000000002s)]
*  more for children, not children, you know what I'm saying? Like, well, I'm not saying that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1206.0s)]
*  is more for children, not children, you know what I'm saying? Like of eight people who want [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1209.68s)]
*  to fuck at whatever age, as long as they're both cool with it. 18. Yeah. In most states. Yeah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1214.0800000000002s)]
*  Dude, I was on a, I was on a, we shot a TV show one time and they had, it was like a, there was [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  this party scene and the guy who was, uh, remember that song. It was like climbing the stairway to [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  heaven. So we're, there's a party at that. There's like a, we shooting at that guy's house. Right. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1237.36s)]
*  Yeah. I think, I think it was that guy. And, um, they had people like fucking doing sex at the party. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1243.6799999999998s)]
*  They hired them. Right. So they were supposed to be in the background, having fun, just having sex. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1251.76s)]
*  Right. So we're just been doing this act and all day, this scene and stuff. And finally it gets on [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  the evening and then those, those actors get there and they're just like, they just start [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1262.8s)]
*  the guy be like, all right, move over here. Here. Fucking. And balloons. The last person, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1268.24s)]
*  some guy was supposed to be blowing up balloons. So you're like, okay, one here. Yep. Fucking [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1275.6s)]
*  balloons. And then the scene would start and these people were just, and the, the one of them had [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1282.72s)]
*  been like, I just came from fucking somewhere else. And I was like, damn, they just travel. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1289.04s)]
*  Those types of people just travel and that's their life. You know, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1295.76s)]
*  do you think you'd be able to do that? If you had a, I mean, you're getting into acting a little [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1300.1599999999999s)]
*  bit, aren't you a little thinking about it or yeah. So do you think that you'd be able to do that? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1303.44s)]
*  Do you think you'd be able to? No. No. But what would you, what would you say if they had, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1309.6s)]
*  that was a big part of your script? I would say, look, man, I'm going to try. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1315.28s)]
*  I'm not going to make any promises. And I think we should have an alternate ending to this scene. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1322.56s)]
*  Because I just, my whole life, I've never been a great, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, that's not been like, I'm good. I'm good at say I'm good. Like [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1334.88s)]
*  I'm good. Like the pre, you know, when they've got walks to the ring and the music's playing, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1339.1999999999998s)]
*  dude, and they're checking them down and the black guy shows up and pats them down or whatever. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1345.6799999999998s)]
*  That's before foreplay. I'm good at that. I'm good at fucking, let's let you know, let's be ready. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1349.6s)]
*  Yeah. We ready. I'm good at all the intro music and everything. It's just, once it starts, I think [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1355.9199999999998s)]
*  sometimes it's just too much. I don't know if it's the viscosity or what it is. And then some, so, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1362.4799999999998s)]
*  but I'm, yeah, I'm just not a distance runner. I'm more of a shot put. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1368.24s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, you know, but that, I mean that that's in the Olympics [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1374.24s)]
*  and people can make careers off that. They're not, I don't think it's good ones. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1378.16s)]
*  I think you probably have another one as well. That's true. But still you're lucky to have [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1381.6s)]
*  background on like a Campbell's chunky Sue bad. I think is your, you might actually be in that scene [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1385.92s)]
*  that we were talking about earlier. Welcome to ball fall. They're calling it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1391.28s)]
*  That's what they're calling it because fall winter, fall is just winter's a sun. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1397.2800000000002s)]

*  And he won it, huh? They said he was like preparing for another, for I guess, oh, he was [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1672.08s)]
*  in a movie called The Wrestler, or Wrestlers. And he won and he started doing jiu-jitsu for that. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1679.04s)]
*  And now he's like a blue belt, which I don't know where that ranks. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1685.76s)]
*  I haven't been, I probably haven't been to jiu-jitsu in two months. Really? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1689.36s)]
*  But I've just been training. I've just been trying to like, I just kept getting hurt so much. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know? Is it true what everyone says about it? Just how it's like, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1697.44s)]
*  I mean, if you watch podcasts from the outside looking in, which is kind of where I feel like [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1702.64s)]
*  I am on the scale, it feels like almost all podcasters do jiu-jitsu. Yeah. Why is that? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1707.76s)]
*  I think probably, well, Rogan got everybody into the, Rogan like merged like these two worlds, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1716.08s)]
*  right? Right. So that's where that like symbiosis happened. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1723.2s)]
*  Right. And after that, you have everybody that kind of like, you start meeting all these guys and [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1727.12s)]
*  you're like, I want to be involved in this. I mean, it seems cool. Oh, it's good, man. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1732.0s)]
*  I did it for like my senior project in high school. You went and did it? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1736.24s)]
*  Yeah. You had to do something. I think I did MMA, which is the same thing. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1740.24s)]
*  Yeah. That's the same thing. But I was a beginner MMA, so you had to [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1742.8s)]
*  start jiu-jitsu, I think. You started doing wrestling. Right. I think- [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1745.36s)]
*  Side control. That's all I remember. MMA is mixed martial arts. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1749.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So that's when they have kickboxing and wrestling. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1752.56s)]
*  We didn't get into any of the kickboxing stuff. Yeah, we didn't either. We just stayed and wrestled. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1756.3999999999999s)]
*  But it was good. It's kind of weird because I would go in, I was 18, so I was like, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1760.4799999999998s)]
*  there's some old dudes in there and they're big and they're stronger than you and they're like, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1764.8799999999999s)]
*  real sweaty. They're more sweaty. I don't know what old guys are sweatier than young guys. And [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1769.84s)]
*  that part of it turned me off a little bit, but I did like the physical component of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1774.08s)]
*  kind of just exerting yourself. I worked out- You know Will Compton? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1777.92s)]
*  Yeah. I worked out with him today this morning. We work out sometimes in Nashville. He lives here [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1781.36s)]
*  and I don't have really a workout schedule at all. And so we'll do a little kind of easy workout. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1786.16s)]
*  But this morning we did conditioning, which I never do. When I started playing football, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1793.92s)]
*  I was like, dude, I'm never doing anything athletic again for the rest of my life. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1798.96s)]
*  Really? I was like, I'm never working out. This is the stupidest thing. I've worked out so hard [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1803.76s)]
*  for my whole life. I'm never working out again. Wow. And I did it for a while and you start [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1807.52s)]
*  feeling real bad. So anyways, I started doing it. I'm pretty much still feeling bad. Yeah, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1812.8s)]
*  yeah. You got to start feeling good, man. But we did conditioning this morning. I felt so [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1817.3600000000001s)]
*  much better after doing a conditioning than just lifting weights. And I asked Will, I was like, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1820.72s)]
*  why do you think it feels so much better to do conditioning? He's like, well, you just go [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1825.28s)]
*  kind of like, you can really exert yourself hard as you can. I feel like that's kind of [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1829.52s)]
*  the same thing with wrestling. You can't half-ass wrestling to get your ass beat. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1833.52s)]
*  Right. So there's something to that. It makes your brain feel better, at least a little. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1840.08s)]
*  Yeah. I think I know what you're talking about. But I'll go into- [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1846.0s)]

*  I didn't try my hardest at all. I was like, what if I'm not trying? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1854.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't. Conditioning sucks. Conditioning does suck, dude. And then the only thing I [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1859.4399999999998s)]
*  realized, I'm conditioning before I get back home and it's just me again. I'm like, damn. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1866.3999999999999s)]

*  We always go get this place in Nashville, it's called 8th and Roast. And we always go over there [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1877.92s)]
*  to get a little burrito afterwards. We have a hard day of conditioning. We up our burritos to two. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1881.84s)]

*  Bro, all you needed is some boots. Now I'm telling you, dude, there's something about [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1891.6s)]

*  can I get in this boot? Do you like Nashville? Are you going to stay here for everything? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1901.92s)]
*  Here's one thing I realized. The people in Nashville are awesome. Awesome people. A lot [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1906.4s)]
*  of unique folks passing through town. Some of the best gas station hangs. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1911.1200000000001s)]
*  I go get coffee every morning at a gas station. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1918.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh, bro. You hit some of these gas stations, you need to go during the owl hours, bro, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1920.5600000000002s)]
*  when the fucking owls are out. There's one, they got two owls land over there at night. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1924.48s)]
*  There's a guy out there and he sees the owls, he tells you, and then you owe him money apparently. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1930.0800000000002s)]
*  That's a twice daily. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1935.28s)]
*  Yeah, it is. It's that twice daily, baby, that tiger mark. So dude over there, bro, that dude [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1936.56s)]
*  fucking, you got to pull up just before he sees those owls if you want to fucking do it on the [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1942.0s)]
*  cheap. But I love that kind of shit, you know? I love that it's kind of like, it still has some [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  values to it. It's a big town. That's what it feels like. So I feel like fortunate that I'm here. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1958.24s)]
*  I don't know if I'll stay here forever. I don't know yet. I think if I had me a wife or something, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1968.48s)]
*  maybe if I got a wife, then I would consider staying somewhere. But until I get a wife, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1971.92s)]
*  dude, I think I'm just a rolling stone. It is kind of hard to decide. I'm the same way as you in [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1977.44s)]
*  terms of I could live anywhere because my work's on the road. For my show, for Sunday [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1982.64s)]
*  conversation, I go to the guest. So as long as there's an airport, I could live anywhere. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1988.64s)]
*  But then you're like, I could live anywhere. And then you've got to decide where you want to live. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1993.44s)]
*  And you try a new city and you make a bunch of friends and you're like, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=1997.5200000000002s)]

*  this town and y'all. Damn, yeah, because some people, they don't even, they don't know your [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2005.8400000000001s)]

*  yeah, it is hard to choose. It's, I feel sometimes I get so angry. You can only live in one place at [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2018.16s)]
*  one time. Yeah, that shit pisses me off. But then there's guys like Jimmy John, who we both know. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2022.4s)]

*  he has an engine. He's super charismatic. Yeah. Pull out some pictures of him. I don't know if [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2111.6800000000003s)]

*  immediately. He's super, you feel he's accessible. Like he's not like, I mean, he's obviously a [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2122.88s)]
*  billionaire, but he's not like some type of person that you feel like you can't talk to him [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2127.84s)]
*  without anything. Oh, you mean John? Big Jimmy John. Yeah. Oh yeah, dude. But then also at the same [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2131.7599999999998s)]

*  I think little Jimmy seems to be the kind of same way, which is kind of crazy because how old is [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2145.28s)]
*  little Jimmy? 13? I don't know. Yeah. He's at his camp and I don't want to share too much of his [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2148.48s)]

*  kind of young Rush Limbaugh of the outdoors, you know? Yes. But Rush ate pills and little Jimmy [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2180.88s)]
*  likes to hunt. Yes. You know? He is like, and the reason I was even talking about big Jimmy is just [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2185.92s)]
*  because he has all these qualities where you, like you said, he'll be successful at anything he tries. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2190.8s)]
*  Yeah. And you look at little Jimmy and you're like, this kid's going to either be the president of [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=2195.44s)]

*  they saw me with their eyes for more than two minutes. Yeah. It's crazy. And it's kind of sad, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4403.2s)]
*  but it's also like, what are you going to do? Yeah. And it's peaceful. And it's peaceful. Yeah. And [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4407.76s)]
*  then soon as they're, they are hanging out with you, like, where's your iPad? Dude. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4412.16s)]
*  Yeah. You want me to help you find it? Yeah. The second you get their attention, you don't want it. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4415.36s)]
*  Yeah. Right. What do you look at the NFL season kicked off? Who are some teams? What are some of [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4421.12s)]
*  your teams you think? What do you think this kind of plays out as? How do you think Tom Brady does? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4425.679999999999s)]
*  How do you think this kind of rolls out for Brady? Dude, I don't know. I've been seeing all the stuff [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4429.5199999999995s)]
*  that's going on. He doesn't look good in terms of his, just his face. Well, people are saying that. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4432.639999999999s)]
*  I think he's, you think his face looks good. He looks leaner. I just can't tell if he maybe [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4436.799999999999s)]
*  has had something done to his face or if he just looks leaner. I think hanging, I think if you're [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4440.4s)]
*  married to a model, the stuff that y'all are talking about at your house, she's always talking [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4445.04s)]
*  about cosmetic stuff. And it's probably just easy to fall into that lifestyle of always trying to [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4449.04s)]
*  improve your looks. Yeah. But do you see what happened with Brett Favre? Oh yeah. He got caught [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4454.0s)]
*  up on that money. They bought a gym for somebody. Yeah. That's not good. But in terms of the NFL, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4459.04s)]
*  to answer your question, dude, I think the bills are a wagon. I know. Like who's doing anything to [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4463.44s)]
*  the bills? I don't, I couldn't imagine anyone, but yeah, I can't imagine. I mean, I don't know [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4471.76s)]
*  if anybody in their division, I mean, maybe if Miami shows up and shows out one game. Well, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4477.52s)]
*  my best friend from college is Mitch Trubisky, who's a starting quarterback for the Steelers. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4483.360000000001s)]
*  And he was on your show too. He was on Sunday Conversations. Yep. And he's a great guy, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4487.280000000001s)]
*  awesome dude. And you know, they drafted Kenny Pickett number one for their first pick. So anytime [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4491.4400000000005s)]
*  you take a quarterback first round, that's your guy. Right. It's just a pay differential. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4497.36s)]
*  They're paying him more than they're paying Mitch. And so you kind of, if you're him, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4502.16s)]
*  I mean, he's in the toughest spot ever where it's like on paper, Kenny Pickett's going to be the [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4506.0s)]
*  starter of their franchise and like their franchise quarterback. That's what they want to happen. But [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4511.28s)]
*  he has to like step in for a time being. Hopefully it's a full season or, you know, he's a two-year [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4516.5599999999995s)]
*  contract, two seasons, but just always having that weight over your shoulder. And he doesn't say that [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4521.839999999999s)]
*  there's a weight on your shoulder, but like, you know that you don't have that room for error. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4526.72s)]
*  Yeah. And so I thought he's been playing, like he played last night. I don't know when this comes [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4531.92s)]
*  out. He played last night against the old Browns and he played pretty good. Like they lost. Like [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4535.04s)]
*  he looked good. He looked like an NFL quarterback. He looked like he belonged on the field. But. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4541.92s)]
*  Yeah. The pressure on some of those guys, I can't imagine. A lot of that's a high pressure situation. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4547.04s)]
*  Oh, all of it is. But then I also always think like, and I tell him too, it's like, dude, you get, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4551.84s)]
*  they get paid for that pressure. Like it's not like you're just a high school quarterback [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4556.8s)]
*  and maybe, you know, Friday night lights and it's like, you have all the pressure. Then you go home [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4561.36s)]
*  and get on your iPad and try not to feel it or whatever. But, you know, he gets paid for the [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4565.04s)]
*  pressure, but that's a tough spot to be in. And that's, so I root for him really hard. I have a [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4571.84s)]
*  bunch of other friends who are on different teams. I play with at Carolina or guys I've met throughout. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4575.2s)]
*  So I kind of root for players. I grew up a Panthers fan, but you know, I root for players now [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4578.96s)]
*  in the pros. So then who do you think you see? So obviously out of the AFC, you see Buffalo. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4586.08s)]
*  They're going to have to have some massive injuries. Right. It's not going to be like one [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4592.4s)]
*  injury is not going to take them out. No. Unless it's Alan, which I don't even want to talk about [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4596.32s)]
*  that, but I don't even, he's that dude is a, he's a, he's a dog though. He's a dog, but they got, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4601.04s)]
*  they have literally every single thing. They have great weapons. He's amazing. They have a great [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4607.04s)]
*  defense. Vaughn Miller somehow, dude, I'm a Panthers fan. I told you Vaughn Miller single-handedly [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4612.799999999999s)]
*  beat the Panthers like 10 years ago in the Superbowl by himself. He was like the MVP of the Superbowl [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4618.0s)]
*  like 25 years ago and he's somehow still like wrecking every play. Yeah. I can't believe they [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4622.96s)]
*  ended up getting him. That's crazy, man. Yeah. For them. Yeah. They're sick, man. Dude, one night I [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4628.48s)]
*  went out here somewhere and it was with Josh Allen and Dawson Knox, right? And it was so funny. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4634.16s)]
*  They've both been drinking and so they, they made a bet with each other and they were like, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4640.72s)]
*  I bet you won't name your kid Fort Knox, right? That's what one of them bet. The other one, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4646.48s)]
*  and he goes, I bet you won't name your son, wrench Allen. Right. So they're like, let's each bet a [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4650.72s)]
*  thousand dollars. And I was like, now I was like, Dawson, you got to bet more. You, you have to get [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4657.12s)]
*  him to bet more because he gets paid more. It's not fair. You have to be comparable. And he's like, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4661.28s)]
*  so then Josh is like, all right, I'll bet 3000. Right. So I'm like, well, then Dawson just made [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4667.2s)]
*  2000 bucks because neither one of y'all is going to name your fucking kid that. So there's Vimbo [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4673.12s)]
*  Dawson, two grand, bro. That's a good bet though. I mean, it was a good bet, but it's like neither [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4679.04s)]
*  one of them is going to follow through. So he just made two grand. I made that dude fucking $2,000. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4686.24s)]
*  He honestly owes you at least one. Yeah, probably 200. I would say 250 probably, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4690.32s)]
*  but they were arguing about it as I walked off. I heard them kind of fucking. Did you ever hang [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4696.0s)]
*  out with George Kittle here? I know he lives here. No, his sister, um, taught me yoga for a while. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4699.2s)]
*  Emma Kittle. Really? Yeah. You like yoga? I do like it, man. I do like it. Sometimes I just want, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4704.4s)]
*  I wish four people would just pull off, just completely pull my body apart and run away with [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4710.96s)]
*  them. Cause I feel like almost once the four forces combined, it's just a bad deal. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4715.2s)]
*  You like it, man. You're already pretty tall though. See you guys are gifted with length. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4722.88s)]
*  You don't have to deal with what we got to deal with in terms of what just being, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4727.2s)]
*  you're always around yourself when you're smaller. Yeah. You know, it's so quick. I touch myself. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4731.12s)]
*  Yeah. I had a, a bow bond, you know, who is like the tallest guy in the NBA. He played for the [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4735.76s)]

*  bone or do they get that signal down to your dick? You get horny in like 25 minutes later. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4757.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. If you got bad thigh, five, that shit ain't going up. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4763.04s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be, I mean, I think they, I think they mean you probably got pretty good heights. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4767.12s)]

*  football. Oh yeah. Cause you always go an inch, inch more. But then, uh, once I finally just [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4783.28s)]
*  admitted I'm like, I'm six one. That's what it is. So I go to the DMV and I had COVID, I think by the [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4788.4s)]
*  time I went to DMV, I didn't know, but it turned out later. So by the way, you see what the Santas [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4792.56s)]

*  people. But I went to the DMV and I was like, she's like, how tall are you? I said, six one. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4806.400000000001s)]

*  get your driver's license renewed every 40 years. Can you believe that? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4841.84s)]
*  It's straight roads. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4845.92s)]
*  I mean, that's true. But I think just for ID purposes, every 40 years, you show somebody your ID. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4847.92s)]
*  It's 40 years ago. Yeah, that's true. I guess it is nice because then people just have to take your word for it. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=4854.719999999999s)]

*  to see like what's really going on here. Why do people like it? But I think the reason why [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5595.2s)]
*  people like it is I think it's super accessible in terms of people, like even like high profile [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5599.12s)]
*  people, whatever come down here, like models will come here, but they're not, if you go to Miami, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5605.44s)]
*  you got to dress up, you got to be seen, you got to look cool. You got to be going to the right place [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5609.599999999999s)]
*  to the right people here. It doesn't matter the type of person that comes. Everyone can go [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5613.36s)]
*  everywhere. You can wear whatever. Yeah, that is true. Yeah. I think that's something nice about it. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5617.28s)]
*  It feels comfortable. Things feel very accessible here. Like my buddy invited me to a concert when [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5621.759999999999s)]
*  I was going to see Black Crows. He's like, do you want to go? I was like, sure. I'll go. In 12 minutes, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5626.48s)]
*  I was parked and we were walking across the street into the amphitheater. It's like, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5631.28s)]
*  things are really, really accessible. Honestly, my biggest worry about Nashville is just about [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5637.2s)]
*  how popular it's getting and how many people like it. So I'm like, if I do, because I'm looking like [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5641.759999999999s)]
*  buy somewhere, like try to even just settle down, even if I don't buy, like settle down in one spot [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5645.92s)]
*  for more than six months, because I've been pretty much doing six months here, six months there. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5651.04s)]
*  Nashville is going to be so different in like five years, 10 years. I know. Everywhere changes, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5656.8s)]
*  but the rate the Nashville is changing is like, you might sign up for something, but you don't [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5660.72s)]
*  necessarily know what you're going to get. Well, it's one of the last cities in the South that is [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5664.4800000000005s)]
*  growing really. A lot of cities have experienced a lot of issues. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5669.52s)]
*  And it's one of the last like kind of Southern cities, I feel like. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5673.2s)]
*  Know who I love, but they have no good airport or else I would think about going there. Mobile, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5676.24s)]
*  Alabama. Oh really? You've been there? Yeah. That's a nice city. That's a very, very Southern nice [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5680.5599999999995s)]
*  city. I stopped over there and saw a buddy of mine in recovery on Thanksgiving. You were both crying [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5685.76s)]
*  in his fucking yard. She was insane, but yeah, I like it down there. I got a half sister lives over [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5691.5199999999995s)]
*  there in Spanish Fort. Yeah. It's nice down there. It's almost like they're pretending like it's [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5698.0s)]
*  Florida, but it's fucking Alabama. Yeah. It's, I really think it has like a charm to it. Kind of [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5704.96s)]
*  feels like Charleston a little bit. Oh, it does downtown. They really made it nice. Yeah. I think [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5709.52s)]
*  as, as more development goes on over there, cause it's gotten real busy in that area. Um, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5714.08s)]
*  um, what happened with the golf? Oh, with the golf. Basically I realized, so my whole thing was [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5718.8s)]
*  like, and I was dead serious about people thought I was messing around and it was, yeah, I knew it was [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5728.400000000001s)]
*  funny to say strokes on what was it? I was fit my first round. I was 51 strokes over par. Okay. So [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5732.88s)]
*  if like par 72, I was like one 21. And so I was like, over the next lifetime, I'm going to get [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5738.0s)]
*  shave 51 strokes off, be a scratch golfer. And then from there, my dream is to go pro on some level. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5745.28s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't have to be PJ tour time. Live wasn't a thing, but it's still a dream. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5750.639999999999s)]
*  It's still a dream, but I'm not working towards it. Okay. Yeah. Which is literally the definition [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5754.639999999999s)]
*  of a dream. But the reason is because I love what I do so much. Like I love working at barstool so [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5760.88s)]
*  much. I love traveling around, making my videos. I realized maybe this is attainable in terms of [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5768.08s)]
*  if I really did, and I have different resources than everyone else probably has, if they were [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5773.84s)]
*  trying to go after this, like I knew people who were like the top Chris Como, who was like [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5778.08s)]
*  Tiger Woods golf coach was like working with me. Wow. But because of barstool and just good [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5782.88s)]
*  networking and like I had some to offer him to and of, of a platform. So I had, I was sponsored by [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5789.04s)]
*  Taylor made and G four, like G four is my clothing sponsor and Taylor made was my club sponsor. So [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5797.92s)]
*  you were all ready to be on the tour. I was honestly, I did make it. I was pro because I [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5803.04s)]
*  was getting paid to be sucky. Yeah. But so I had like way more resources. So if I think, and I have [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5806.64s)]
*  like a, I'm not a great athlete, but I'm like a good enough athlete where I think I'm past a [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5812.48s)]
*  threshold of what you have to be to be a professional golfer. And I do think I have the mind for it, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5818.96s)]
*  but I realized you have to do this every single day and you can't, I couldn't have made videos, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5824.4s)]
*  traveled, don't eat the stuff I love to do that the lifestyle that I work so hard to get to, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5829.6s)]
*  I work so hard to get to the lifestyle that I love. And I was going to have to just like [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5835.280000000001s)]
*  cancel it out to just play golf every day. And I was like, it's not, it's not worth it to me. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5839.6s)]
*  I'd rather just be a dream. Well, it's, it's interesting because you're kind of living one [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5845.120000000001s)]
*  dream. Yeah. It's hard to dream jump. That's kind of what I realized. And it sounds so obvious, but [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5849.120000000001s)]
*  I was like, dude, I'm already living a dream. Why am I going to cancel out some that I know I already [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5855.44s)]
*  have to go from that might not get, I could break my back and just have neither thing. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=5860.639999999999s)]

*  I've shot guns and stuff like that. And I actually went out one time and tried to kill a deer [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6218.24s)]
*  and didn't. And I'm nervous that I will get out there because so many people I love, love it. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6222.16s)]
*  And I want to be a part of it. It seems like such a fun activity to do in such a good hobby. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6228.879999999999s)]
*  As you get older, do you need more hobbies? Yeah, I've got to get some good hobbies, man. I think [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6233.12s)]
*  I'm a little bit nervous. Like I wish we had to fight the animal with a knife. For me, I feel [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6238.16s)]
*  like then it seems more fair. You could do that with pigs, I think. Yeah. But even then I think [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6244.320000000001s)]
*  they, somebody kind of holds them and you run up and stab them. It seems like Jesus. Dude, what's [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6248.4800000000005s)]
*  different about that than killing with a gun from like five, five meters away? This seems even like [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6254.16s)]
*  fucking more Italian or something. Like, why are we doing this, man? That's just sausage, bro. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6259.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, but I don't know. It's like just two guys, you barely know their fucking shit. You [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6264.88s)]
*  just run up and shank them. But that's what I like for hunting is like, I do feel a part of me. I [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6270.24s)]
*  want to be a part of the adventure and I want to love it. But I would be lying if I said there [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6274.96s)]
*  wasn't a part of me. It's like, I have a gun. I got a gun. Yeah. I'm going to win this. What's [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6279.84s)]
*  the challenge? But I know there is one, but I just don't understand it fully. I'm excited for [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6287.2s)]
*  Michael to teach us about it. Yeah. And I think he said there's different options of things that we [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6292.4s)]
*  could shoot, you know, or things that we could trap or kill. I wouldn't mind setting something [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6296.16s)]
*  up. You strangle something, a duck, you know, which seems like it'd be easy to catch in like a. Dude, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6300.72s)]
*  well, I was living in Florida that you can kill the iguanas. Oh, wow. If you want, you can, you [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6306.4s)]

*  anything you want. Yeah. Oh, wow. And what can you, are you like when you can just go do it whenever? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6318.0s)]

*  well, dude. It's not going to end well. I don't know. Yeah. You might be right, man. You want to [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6356.0s)]
*  hunt the drugs? No, I don't do it. The dogs do it. That's true. Yeah. And they probably got cloud and [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6361.04s)]

*  attacked another dog on the side of the street and it was getting walked. It was in Boca Raton. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6391.040000000001s)]
*  So his dog attacked another dog on the side of the street. And this, this other dog is getting [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6395.52s)]
*  walked by old, it's Boca. So you can imagine what the lady's looking like. And, uh, and it's just [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6399.84s)]

*  Anyways, I had to, I had to pick up, I had to pull the pit bull off this other dog. I think it [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6425.2s)]
*  was a golden doodle. I had to pick it up and I, and I got it off, but as soon as it landed, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6431.04s)]
*  it jumped up and that dog bit me and walked into my arm. The little one, the little one. And it was [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6436.16s)]
*  cause it was scared and it wouldn't let go for, it felt like 30 seconds, but it was probably one [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6440.5599999999995s)]
*  second. So I had to go to the hospital, everything. So I got it all figured out the next week, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6443.76s)]
*  the next week I'm going through the Charleston airport and I got a long flight back to New York. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6449.2s)]
*  This is a while ago and I had taken a little bit of an edible of weed. And so just for nothing, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6453.52s)]
*  nothing crazy, but yeah, just to get home. And, and I was, as soon as I got there, I probably took it [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6460.400000000001s)]
*  like 30 minutes before I got there. As soon as I get there, I'm like kind of, I'm like feeling it. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6471.200000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm just, I'm a little aware of everything that's going on and not at the same time. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6474.96s)]
*  Yeah. And this, this police officer walks up to me as I'm going through TSA and he said, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6479.84s)]
*  Hey buddy, come here. I said, Oh man. I was like, what's this going to be? He's like, Hey, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6484.88s)]
*  we have these, these bomb dogs out here and we were testing them. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6492.24s)]
*  We need, we need you to walk through TSA and we're going to give you this little, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6496.400000000001s)]
*  it was like a little packet. He's like, you just put it in your pocket and it smells like a bomb. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6501.6s)]
*  He's like, just walk through TSA like you're normal and just, we're going to see if the dogs [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6506.16s)]
*  notice. So I'm high as a kite. Walking through TSA and I just got attacked by a dog the week before. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6510.64s)]
*  And finally it's my time. It's, it's my time to go through the thing. I'm looking at the dogs, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6522.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm looking around and by the way, they didn't tell other people in TSA line. Oh, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6526.08s)]
*  because it's a long TSA line with a hundred other people. Yeah, that's missing. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6530.0s)]
*  Communication. And so I walked through and of course, I'm losing my mind. I'm freaking out. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6533.52s)]
*  The whole airport's looking at this guy's got a bomb. Oh, damn, bro. I made it out alive, but [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6546.080000000001s)]
*  yeah, I don't, and I don't, I don't mess with dogs like that anymore. In terms of breaking up [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6556.320000000001s)]
*  their fights, if they're going to fight best man wins. Yeah. Somebody else has got, you know, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6560.88s)]
*  that's God or nature. Like nature does all kinds of shit that we try to stop a lot of times. That's [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6564.88s)]
*  insane flooding dog fights. It's like, you gotta think like, let it flood. Yeah. We're like, we'll [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-CcToGiUM&t=6570.08s)]
