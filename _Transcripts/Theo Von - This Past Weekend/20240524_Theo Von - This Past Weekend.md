**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE)
*  I want to announce that we have a show in Cork, Ireland now on June 9th at Live at the Marquis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=0.0s)]
*  New York City, New York, May 31st, Belfast, London, Idaho Falls, Salt Lake City, and Las Vegas, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=6.88s)]
*  Nevada there. Fourth of July weekend we'll be there in Las Vegas, Nevada for two nights at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=17.84s)]
*  Resorts World. You can get all tickets at theovon.com slash t-o-u-r and thank you for your support. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=22.64s)]
*  And if tickets are too expensive make sure you're not buying them on a secondary site. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=30.96s)]
*  You got to do that. That's why we suggest go through the website. And if they're too, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=35.44s)]
*  if they're sold out or something and they're expensive on secondary sites, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  just hold the line. We'll come back through some other time. I love you guys, baby. Thank you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=48.16s)]
*  All right, check, check. Chicken. Check your chicken, baby. Check your chicken. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=53.76s)]
*  God, how do you know if a chicken is a woman? I guess if it has an egg, huh? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=63.04s)]
*  But now there's definitely, there's got to be a lot of dude chickens [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=68.4s)]
*  like that will just like hide an egg under their little chicken arm or whatever it's called, little [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=72.16s)]
*  flat like feather chicken arm. There's got to be a lot of little, and they hide, and then when they, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  and then they sneak over by the women chickens and then just kind of sneak it out. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  A lot of dude chickens trying to get over there and just hang out with the babe chickens. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=95.12s)]
*  So there's got to be a lot. That's the thing. It's like, you don't even know a man chicken. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=100.96s)]
*  Maybe you just look at it in its eyes, you know, say, are you a man chicken or not? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=105.76s)]
*  But yeah, I think there's got to be a lot of female chickens that are men that are closeted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=113.6s)]
*  men or whatever, or that are just hiding an egg like, and then when nobody's looking, they just, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=122.32s)]
*  lay that bitch down and then pretend that they're women and sit over there with the, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=130.16s)]
*  with the women chickens and watch my 700 pound [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=135.04s)]
*  wakeboarder or whatever. I don't even know what some of the shows that women are watching now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=143.68s)]
*  I think my 600 pound dental assistant or whatever. There's like all, there's like, yeah, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=147.36s)]
*  there's a show the other day. It was like my 440 pound mailman or whatever. Like, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=152.56s)]
*  dude, if that you're never getting your mail, if that's who is helping you out that you are, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=158.16s)]
*  you're not getting any mail. So, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=165.52s)]
*  but yeah, that's the thing. Now you don't, a lot of chickens, you don't know if they are real [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=171.2s)]
*  chickens. You don't know who's being a woman chicken, who's being just a sneaky man chicken [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=175.12s)]
*  hiding an egg under its little wing or whatever. That's the word wing. Yeah. You don't know who's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=180.56s)]
*  hiding a little egg under its wing. And then it just sneaks over there by the women and is just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=188.0s)]
*  like, and just drops that bitch off, baby. Like they're one of Easter's little hit men, baby. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=191.92s)]
*  They're just, that's a, that's a lot of men in disguise being women nowadays, all over. So [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=199.76s)]
*  yeah, like that trans, it's like that trans swimmer at the Penn State or whatever, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=210.56s)]
*  or Penn or University of Pennsylvania. It's like that trans swimmer. That's the kind of chickens [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=215.04s)]
*  they have nowadays. A lot of men chickens are sneaking into women's chicken worlds and being [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=220.56s)]
*  women's chickens because it's easier probably. That's why I would guess. And maybe because they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  get a little bit more attention. And some of that makes sense. It's like, if we don't, if men don't [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=235.12s)]
*  get any attention for being men, if they're not rewarded anymore for being men, then they, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=242.96s)]
*  some they will, some will slink over to woman to be in a woman just to still get attention. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=249.12s)]
*  Cause even as creatures, I believe that we need attention as male or female creatures. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  What's up guys. Welcome to the podcast. Sorry. It's been a while since I've done a solo episode. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=262.72s)]
*  There's a couple of reasons. One, it was just, we started getting more guest opportunities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=269.2s)]
*  And so that was nice. And then two, it was, I was just kind of exhausted, I think, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=273.76s)]
*  like burnt out. And so it was hard for me to get into a space where I just felt like I could just [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=281.92s)]
*  have a fun, normal conversation or, or where I could just drop into my thoughts or feelings easily. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=288.48s)]
*  Every week was just, everything was just kind of like a lot. And I do want, I honestly want to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  apologize for that. Not like I need to apologize for it, but this is the kind of stuff that's most [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=302.16s)]
*  important to me is having episodes like this and just solo episodes. And so I'm going to do a better [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=307.76s)]
*  job of that. I'm not going to put like a number on myself or anything, but I'm going to do a better [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=317.68s)]
*  job of keeping that going over the rest of the year. So I'm looking forward to that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=322.48s)]
*  And as always, you can hit the hotline if there's something going on. 985-664-9503 [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  is the hotline number. Yeah, we hit 500 episodes. That's, I can't, that's 500 episodes, dude. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  That's unreal. Let me look back at one of the first episodes. Here we go. Let's listen to the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=349.12s)]
*  beginning of the first episode. Wow, dude, it was seven years ago. And this is this past weekend. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=356.24s)]
*  It's the first one I ever done. The first one I'm seeing how it goes. I'm literally sitting in my [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=363.68s)]
*  closet right now in my apartment in Los Angeles. I hung some blankets up on the walls. I don't even [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=371.52s)]
*  know if that's how you make a sound area for recording. I have a luggage bag laying on its [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=377.84s)]
*  side. Like it was a casualty of war. And then I have this microphone sitting on top of it. Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  Wow, that's wild. I'm going to go ahead and play that. I'm going to play that. I'm going to play [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  Wow, that's wild. That's wild, man. Just to think that we got to 500 episodes and you just said [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  that that's how it began was in that closet. Just a little fell in the closet, dude. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=407.2s)]
*  And that is not a euphemism, bro. That was, I just audio documented the fact that it was actually a [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=411.52s)]
*  man physically in a closet. A straight man. Yeah. And I turned over a piece of luggage and I set the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=416.88s)]
*  camera or the audio mic up on the, on top of it. And it was just an audio podcast. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=425.52s)]
*  Yeah. And then there was, I remember we had the first jingle. If we can play that, the intro, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=434.24s)]
*  let me find it here. At the beginning of this episode, this was our early intro right here. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=441.84s)]
*  Welcome to this past weekend. This past weekend. Welcome to this past weekend. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=452.56s)]
*  Let's connect that boom boom. What's up you chinchilla relas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=461.04s)]
*  Bienvenidos este fin de semana pasado. This past weekend. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=464.56s)]
*  Yeah. So at some point I started taping in my kitchen [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=473.04s)]
*  and that was for six months. For six months I was taping in my kitchen and we had some producers [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=477.12s)]
*  that we met, that I met online. I don't even remember. I don't think, did you come help me [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=487.36s)]
*  in my kitchen, Nick? Yeah, one time. Oh, you did. Wow. Thank you. Yeah, we did it in the kitchen for [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=492.88s)]
*  about six months. And I remember I would stay up for a while in the beginning. I would just edit it [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=504.0s)]
*  myself and put it up. And then I would keep my girlfriend up. She's like, what are you doing? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=507.84s)]
*  And I'd be sitting there just making sure everything made sense online. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=513.44s)]
*  That was pretty wild. And then there was a guy, there was a company called Grey Block Pizza and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=519.76s)]
*  I met the owner, Thomas, and he started advertising. He was our first advertiser on the podcast. This [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=527.76s)]
*  was the ad read right here. This week's episode brought to you by Grey Block Pizza at 1811 Pico [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=536.4000000000001s)]
*  Boulevard in Los Angeles on the way to the beach. You headed to the sunshine. You want some sand in [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=543.6s)]
*  your feet on the way there. Stop in, get that Italian mouthful. You know, Grey Block, get that hitter. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=548.96s)]
*  And he said, you should get a studio. He said, with the ad money, you should get a studio. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=555.04s)]
*  And then that's what we did. So the fighter and the kid had an old studio. We took their old spot. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  They had moved to a bigger one next door. And then we started getting more regular guests. We got [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=568.88s)]
*  Chris Ryan came in and Jay Moore, Jeannie Buss, Dustin Poirier, D Snider. We had Eddie Bravo, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=574.64s)]
*  Jamie Kennedy. Yeah, a lot of just early heroes that showed up. Uneven Steven, he was a homeless guy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=584.48s)]
*  And yeah, it just continued to build from there. We had a blind person come up to us and say, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=594.64s)]
*  I'm going to go to the gym. We had a blind person come on. Michael Bisping came in there. Jordan [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=603.04s)]
*  Peterson came in. Who else? Bobby Lee. It just kept going. Or we just kept doing it. You know, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=608.16s)]
*  there were times when it was good and times when it wasn't going good. It was always going good. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=618.88s)]
*  It was just going. That's really the truth. And we just kept doing it. You know, we just kept doing [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=623.52s)]
*  it. We've had a great group of producers over the years that have helped. Nick Davis was really the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=631.36s)]
*  starting producer and he's back with us now. Zach Powers is one of our lead producers now. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=639.52s)]
*  Colin Reiner, Ben Becker, Ari Maness has stepped in to help produce episodes when we're traveling [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=650.64s)]
*  with him. This guy, Chris, Shy Chris, we called him. Really amazing dude. My buddy [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=656.72s)]
*  Sherb, there was this dude for a little while. We were in between studios and I would tape at [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  his studio at night. And he overdosed a few years ago, but I keep him in my heart, man. He's a guy [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=673.6s)]
*  that helped me get through weeks where there wouldn't have been an episode. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=682.48s)]
*  There was times I remember I did it in my car a few times in the middle of the night in a driveway [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=687.28s)]
*  somewhere in Illinois. One time I needed to get an episode out. All right. I'm coming to you live [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=692.32s)]
*  from a Nissan Sentra about 20 miles from the nearest internet. It is dark out here, dude. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=698.08s)]
*  I mean, you can't see nothing. I mean, the devil could be just smelling the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=706.56s)]
*  cinnamon stains on your skin and you wouldn't know he's right next to you. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=715.12s)]
*  And then just people would make beautiful art and really, it's just been a really amazing world. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=720.8s)]
*  And I'll have to go over some of that in the future. There's a guy that made these really [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=726.4s)]
*  cool cards and whenever we would do an episode, he would do an outline, like a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=730.32s)]
*  stitching or whatever, a stitching of the person, the guest who'd been on. And he made a great [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=737.2s)]
*  collection of those for us. I'll make sure to put it in on the YouTubes so you can see it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=744.96s)]
*  But we moved into another studio and we were there for a few years. And then finally we're in [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=751.2s)]
*  even a new studio now. So it's been an evolution and it's been really crazy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=758.0s)]
*  It's something that really started like just, it was kind of just talking about stuff and then [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=768.32s)]
*  guys connecting about things, a lot of fellas, and sometimes even women were connecting. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=773.04s)]
*  You know, I remember one woman called in once and a man had touched her, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=777.92s)]
*  they were dating and some fella had touched her vagina in an empty refrigerator box. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=790.0s)]
*  And that was just, that's when I knew we were definitely on to something. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=795.4399999999999s)]
*  We were doing something right. Because there was an element of mystery there. There was [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  missing appliance. There was sexual touching. There was sexual tension. It was, you know, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=808.24s)]
*  and I think she was even a redhead. And there was, so it was, I remember that moment was pretty [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=817.76s)]
*  solid. Other moments, the fella that got hit by the train, Dalton, I think was his name. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=823.36s)]
*  I remember that, baby, two trains. And he even said, he said, look, if God wants that train to [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=831.36s)]
*  hit me again, I'm ready. I'm ready to be hit again by a locomotive. And I knew that's how I just said, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=837.12s)]
*  damn, we're really doing something here. You know, and yeah, it's just been a special time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=844.72s)]
*  It's been amazing to have this opportunity. And I don't know if I'm just sounding like just like a [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=849.92s)]
*  like a mechanical bull or whatever. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=855.76s)]
*  Yeah, this pocket, it's just given me so many more opportunities than ever thought. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=862.4s)]
*  You know, it's given me opportunities to talk with strangers about stuff that's real. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  It's given me the opportunity to talk with people I really look up to and admire [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=873.52s)]
*  with stuff that's real and not real and fun. It's given me a chance to learn a lot about myself. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=879.6s)]
*  And yeah, that's what I wanted to be moving forward. And I wanted to do a solo episode [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=889.52s)]
*  sooner for episode 500, but it just didn't shake out that way. And, and I didn't stress myself [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=894.72s)]
*  about it. I didn't go over like, I got it, you know, I just said, look, when the time is right, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=901.28s)]
*  it'll be you'll get it right. And even today we started out an hour and a half late because [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=906.72s)]
*  there was some technical issues here, but that's okay. Here we are, you know, and, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=911.68s)]

*  which I think has probably kept me off of like, probably using drugs sometimes because I knew I [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=956.64s)]
*  had to be here the next day or I knew I had to be ready for a guest. So just thank you for tuning [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=962.4s)]

*  gaggle of pigeons. You know, that's what I am sometimes. Dude, I looked at a damn pigeon the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1115.52s)]
*  other day and let's be honest, bro. These bitches are. They don't have any shoulders, bro. Right. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1121.36s)]
*  So right out the gate, you know, they fucking probably. You know, they're lying about a lot of [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1129.6s)]
*  shit. And they just kind of, they fucking, they look like they've been smoking too. A lot of pigeons [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1136.32s)]
*  are just doves that that smoke. That's it, dude. If you want to know what smoking will do to your [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1144.8s)]
*  lungs, look at a dove and then look at a pigeon, baby. Look at a fucking pigeon, dude. Pigeons are [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1152.32s)]

*  that pigeons aren't from Philadelphia. Okay. And New Jersey. You could look at a pigeon easy, dude. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1169.52s)]

*  They don't give a fuck, dude. They can't fly. Imagine watching a pigeon walk. They walk at night [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1212.72s)]
*  because they're, I think, ashamed of kind of how their body is. But a lot of them walk at night down [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1220.56s)]
*  south to fucking party because you know every puddle in New Orleans has booze in it. Them fucking [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1226.48s)]

*  off that 12 proof water, baby. Everything down there got booze in it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1253.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, every pigeon should have to wear an eagle's jersey. That's a fact. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1258.96s)]
*  Every pigeon should have to wear an eagle's jersey. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1263.6000000000001s)]
*  Dude, I was at the doctor the other day. I saw a pigeon there. What kind of bird goes to the doctor? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1266.8s)]
*  Not one of God's birds, buddy. Pigeons, dirt birds, dick chickens. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1278.16s)]
*  That's all they are, bro. That's all they are. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1288.16s)]

*  he was showing his son a pigeon. And I was like, that's, you don't show your son a pigeon. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1314.72s)]
*  Okay? You don't, you don't show your son a pigeon. You show your son a damn eagle or an egret or a [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1322.72s)]

*  Dating type shit. Homeward. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1916.64s)]
*  You know, we've been going out for a minute and, you know, when you get to know somebody, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1921.2s)]

*  my heart just broke, man. Like driving home that night was the worst feeling I've ever had. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1937.44s)]
*  One of the worst days of my life, man. Some of the people she told me were just outrageous, man. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1941.68s)]
*  Some of my homies, like people I fuck with and then just some random like, what the fuck, you know? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1946.0s)]

*  to try to get past it. And I know that it's something you can definitely get past. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1957.12s)]
*  And I was wondering if you had any advice. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1962.88s)]
*  Yang, baby. I appreciate that call, Elijah. And dude, I'll tell you, bro, I dated a girl who [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1965.36s)]
*  um, she worked over at, uh, at Charlie Caso's, maybe Chuck E. Cheese's. And she, dude, had she [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1973.76s)]
*  had racked up with everybody in there. OK, she'd racked up with the, uh, the waiter, the, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1982.56s)]
*  the nearsighted chick that did the ticket. She hooked up with her, the boss. Dude, I don't even [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1992.24s)]
*  know there was a boss at Chuck E. Cheese's, bro. The chef, she hooked up with the chef, uh, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=1997.92s)]
*  Pascalie that's in the band. Not even the lead singer, not even the rap, not even the mouse, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2005.28s)]
*  the chef, the chef, the dude that's like, uh, playing the triangle and like stirring the pot [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2015.04s)]
*  or whatever. She hooked up with that guy. So it was tough. I'd go meet her for work or pick her up. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2020.64s)]
*  And it was like, I would go in there and feel kind of embarrassed sometimes. But, um, but she [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2026.72s)]
*  was actually a really cool girl, man. And sometimes I regret that I wasn't brave enough to just kind [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2032.24s)]
*  of let it be her past. You know, I kind of like, I kept holding her past against her and it made it [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2037.68s)]
*  miserable for her. And it made it miserable for really just for us. Like we couldn't like, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2045.92s)]
*  it was tough, you know, cause she could never, I never gave her really room to, to, to, to like, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2052.4799999999996s)]
*  first of all, I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have held her past against her. And then I never [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2064.4799999999996s)]
*  gave her enough. There was never a way that she could make it up to me because it's impossible [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2068.08s)]
*  to make up a past and she shouldn't have to make it up to me. She doesn't have to. So I kind of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2073.8399999999997s)]
*  made it. Everything was always at a deficit. You know, I had an unrealistic expectation. So, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2079.84s)]
*  yeah. So I wish that that, that maybe I had done that different, you know, maybe I'd been the dude [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2089.76s)]
*  that rolls up with her and just rocks with her and just respects her more. Here's what I'll say, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2093.6800000000003s)]
*  man, you can, you can miss the good ones. And if she's an awesome girl, man, then that's, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2098.48s)]
*  just be awesome with her. But the other stuff will go by the wayside. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2104.48s)]
*  Cause when you get older too, that doesn't matter, bro. Everybody's dated or everybody's trans or [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2108.96s)]
*  whatever. You don't even know what's going on, bro. You'll reach in somebody's pants and there's just [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2115.12s)]
*  a damn scratch off ticket in it. People don't even have crotches. It doesn't even matter. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2119.9199999999996s)]
*  People are nearsighted, farsighted. People don't even know, people don't even know what's going on. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2125.52s)]
*  So I think if you got a cool chick, lock it down because it gets, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2131.92s)]
*  there's not that many great ones out there. You know, and if you got a good one, lock her down [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2136.88s)]
*  and just be proud. That's my girl. But yeah, holding that resentment, dude, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  if you hold a resentment against somebody that there's no way they could [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2146.7999999999997s)]
*  holding that resentment is miserable. Cause you're never going to let it go. So I think you got to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2150.7999999999997s)]
*  deal with that on your side and then just show up to her like a fricking man. You know, but I say, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2156.64s)]
*  yeah, you know, you can be the dude that rocks with her and respects her. You could be that dude, bro. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2162.7999999999997s)]
*  You could be that dude. Cause I believe that women are a reflection of the men in their life. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2167.6s)]
*  I really believe that. So if you show up and you really lift a lady up and you make her feel like [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2176.16s)]
*  something good and you make her feel value and you make her feel important, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2181.68s)]
*  if she's somebody you care about, you know, then that's how they will be. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2189.7599999999998s)]
*  I believe that. I believe that women are a reflection of men, of the men in their life. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  Now I'm not saying I've had the best luck or the most ability to be a good boyfriend or whatever. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2202.24s)]
*  So I don't even know if I would listen to me, but I appreciate you asking. And yeah, man. And if you [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2209.3599999999997s)]
*  love her, love her, bro, you know, don't miss the boat, homie, cause the Marina only gets smaller. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2216.56s)]
*  You feel me? Don't piss where you fish homie. You feel me? I don't know what the second one means, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2224.3199999999997s)]
*  but the first one I think is a, is important. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2230.48s)]
*  Is important. What else? I'm trying to think of things that happened. Oh, we got to do the Morgan [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2234.7999999999997s)]
*  Wallen walkout at his show. That was really interesting. I was so nervous, dude. So I go, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2241.7599999999998s)]
*  it was nice. And Morgan, he texted me and asked me to go cause it's, you know, it's like a thing [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2251.04s)]
*  that's just kind of like a strange thing, but it's like a thing that everybody loves. It's like that [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2254.3199999999997s)]
*  hype, you know, when they're doing Broadway girls in the beginning. So I go and I get there and I'm [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2259.6s)]
*  asked Morgan, I was like, do we practice? And he just looked, he looked at me like I was out of my [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2267.44s)]
*  mind, bro. Out of my mind. So we don't practice. We're just all backstage. It was like his band, me, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2272.24s)]
*  um, DeAndre Hopkins, uh, one of D hop's boys, um, my friend Zita, a little group was just back there. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2281.44s)]

*  Morgan is just real casual about it. You know, it's just him just walking into work, but like we, uh, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2303.6s)]
*  and D hop was cool because he works at the stadium. He works, he's a NFL athlete. So he'd been, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2309.52s)]
*  he'd, he's comes out all the time of the tunnel, but I'd never gotten to do it. You know, something [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2315.68s)]

*  and then I was like, what if I hit somebody on accident or something goes wrong? What if I go [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2333.68s)]
*  crazy and just run out on the stage and just start playing some, um, uh, George straight or something. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2339.28s)]
*  I just didn't want to freak out or have do something, you know, cause I can't always rely [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2347.76s)]
*  on myself. And so I didn't, so I just took it easy and I didn't want to try to like, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2352.5600000000004s)]
*  you know, it's Morgan's show. So you don't want to try and like, uh, you know, be too cool for [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2358.32s)]
*  school. You're just happy to be there to support, you know, just to be just supportive. So it was [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2363.68s)]
*  interesting, man. And it was, it was really fun. And the craziest part is you get to the end and [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2371.44s)]
*  he gets to go perform and me and DeAndre started kind of walking up the ramp with him. Like we [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2375.9199999999996s)]
*  were like, cause it's like, this is as close as I'm ever going to get to being like a musical star. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2380.72s)]
*  This moment and it's not close at all. It's really just helping. I walked and walk, right? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2388.8799999999997s)]
*  But for me and DeAndre, it was as close, bro. We were like, we started walking and then they're like, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2395.8399999999997s)]
*  no, no, you too. And literally just security shows up and just sent us to the back and just made us [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2401.04s)]
*  stop. You know, uh, I don't think Morgan would have cared. I think he was, he's just having a good time. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2407.6s)]
*  But, um, but dude, it was just a bummer. You want to go out there so bad. You just want to be, you [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2412.64s)]

*  have to sunk halfway down in there. And so then we try to go help her and she would just curse at [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2783.04s)]
*  us sometimes and yell at us and stuff. But, but she was having some beer and you had to just [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2787.7599999999998s)]

*  let's hear more. I mean, I'm not proud about it, but it was false. I just found myself using again. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2910.48s)]
*  And what's it called? I mean, I'm a little disappointed in myself, but, uh, I think I just, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2918.64s)]
*  I just found myself addicted again and falling back on using the drugs to cope with things. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2926.48s)]
*  But falling back on using drugs to cope with things. Yeah, man. I can certainly, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2933.52s)]
*  well, once you kind of, you know, relapse or people use the term a lot, uh, then yeah, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2938.8799999999997s)]
*  it's hard to get back on the horse. Um, but let me hear a little more. I mean, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2945.36s)]

*  or am I addicted? Hmm. It's hard to know if you're, that's a great question. It's hard to know if [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2965.6800000000003s)]
*  you're just coping or if you're an addict. I guess if I'm just coping, well, I think the thing is, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2971.68s)]
*  if you're using drugs and alcohol to cope, then some of that's fine. But if you're overdoing it, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2980.3199999999997s)]
*  then it's not fun. And I think if you start to wonder if you're an addict, then I'm not saying [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2985.9199999999996s)]
*  you are an addict, but I remember one time I was driving around AA houses, like around the [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2993.04s)]
*  buildings and I was talking to my brother on the phone one time and he's like, what are you up to? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=2998.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm just driving around this AA meeting. He's like, what do you, what do you mean? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3002.16s)]
*  I said, well, there's an AA meeting by my apartment and it's really cool. So, and sometimes [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3007.68s)]
*  I'll come and drive around it and he goes, well, I'm not trying to label you or call you out. He [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3011.9199999999996s)]
*  goes, but I said, you know, who's not, he goes, you know, who's not driving around an AA meeting? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3018.16s)]
*  I said, who? He goes, people who are people who are sure they don't have a problem. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3023.92s)]
*  And he was right. I mean, I'd kind of go over by it and jump down peak in the building, peek in [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3030.48s)]
*  the windows and shit, you know? And so at that point for me, it was like, I just had to look at [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3034.7200000000003s)]
*  my actions and not my thoughts. I was like, my actions, if I'm driving in a circle around an AA [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3041.2000000000003s)]
*  meeting and it's parking lot out to the street back around in the parking lot out to the, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3047.92s)]
*  then that's my action. And it's a little, you know, it's a lot, but it's given me some signs. So [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3053.6800000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't be hard on yourself though, man. Give yourself some grace, brother. You had four months [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3062.2400000000002s)]
*  sober. That's incredible. Four months. Have anybody do anything for four months, anything. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3066.64s)]
*  Extremely hard, extremely hard. So give yourself some grace, you know? But I think you just have [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3073.52s)]
*  to ask yourself and you'll know the answer. And then I think you have to make a choice. Like some [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3082.48s)]
*  guys will hit me up and be like, do I, I can't quit. Do I need to go to AA meetings? Like if you are [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3089.6s)]
*  actually have a dependency on drugs or alcohol, then you probably have to go to a detox and then [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3095.28s)]
*  you could get into maybe a sober living or just go to AA meetings. But I'm not a doctor. I just [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3100.48s)]
*  know what works for me. I never had to detox. But that would be questions that somebody else could [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3105.76s)]
*  help you with. But I always say go to three or four meetings and see how you feel. And go to [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3113.04s)]
*  different ones, you know, if you can, just to get a real idea of what they're like. Don't go to one [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3119.52s)]
*  and be like, this sucks or whatever. Yeah, but that's a huge progression. I think it's a [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3124.2400000000002s)]
*  yeah, but that's a huge progression, man. I'd be, I would be proud of yourself. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3129.2s)]
*  And I would just give yourself some grace, man. You're trying. You're a human. That's really [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3133.44s)]
*  making an effort. And, and that's really, that's beautiful, dog. You got that shit, baby. Praise God. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3137.84s)]
*  What else? Here we got another call, a lot of breast calls, and this is something that's okay. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3148.48s)]
*  You know, we do want to ask people to hit the hotline. Let us know the first time somebody [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3155.36s)]
*  touched your genitalia, you know, and what that experience was like. Was it scary? Was it exciting? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3159.12s)]
*  Was it take us back through some of that? 985-664-9503. You know, once a year, we like to tap into [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3166.96s)]
*  to the memories of sensual memories and that sort of thing. And that's how that, you know, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3177.6800000000003s)]
*  the lady, they got touched in that refrigerator box. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3184.88s)]
*  You know, that's where you get to really interactive folks like that. So beautiful stuff. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3190.2400000000002s)]
*  We want to explore. Got a call that came in right here. Onward. Hey Theo, man. I was [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3194.8s)]
*  wondering, I was swimming at the lake one time with my cousin and we were jumping off the dock, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3203.92s)]
*  just beautiful day. It was gorgeous out. And she come up out of the water and one of her tities [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3212.56s)]
*  was out. Oh yes, buddy. Yeah, brother. That's breaching, baby. That's what they call it. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3220.72s)]
*  That's breaching, baby. That's nature, daddy. You can watch that on damn Shark Channel. Let's [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3229.44s)]
*  hear more. I sat there looking at it and I didn't really know what to do or say really. So I just [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3235.2799999999997s)]
*  didn't say anything. I just kind of took it in. I don't have any regrets. I don't think that I [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3243.2s)]
*  should have said anything in that moment. It would have just made it too much, you know, in that [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3251.7599999999998s)]
*  in that moment. Look, brother, I think that there's, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3259.84s)]
*  I think that those are second tier tits, brother, on a cousin. That's second tier [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3265.52s)]
*  tittery, baby. That's nothing. First tier tits, that's mom tits. And if you stare at your mom's [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3270.8s)]
*  tits for more than two seconds, you will be absorbed off of the face of the earth by Satan. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3279.44s)]
*  So that is hands down, no pass go or whatever, straight to hell. So that's the first rule. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3286.7999999999997s)]
*  Second, that mid tier tit is sister, right? Mid tier is sister. That's sister's breasts. I think [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3296.96s)]
*  you can look at them probably maybe six to eight seconds. You know what I'm saying? Just enough to [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3304.4s)]
*  place first on a bull, you know, you don't want to get crazy because there's first of all, you're [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3313.44s)]
*  just you're making sure everything's cool. But you don't want to lie. You don't want to drop in on [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3317.6s)]
*  them. You know, you want to keep your mouth closed when you look at them. That's normal, I think. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3322.56s)]
*  Now, if you look at your sister's breasts and it's and it doesn't feel like they're your sister's [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3328.8s)]
*  breasts, then one of y'all's parents is lying. I think about something. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3335.04s)]
*  You know, and then there's the cousin breasts or tits. Some people call them tits and I don't. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3341.44s)]
*  Actually, I do a lot of times. But yeah, and now cousin breasts, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3350.24s)]
*  yeah, I'd say 30 seconds, 25 to 30 seconds, 28 seconds. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3356.2400000000002s)]
*  Be cool. Keep your sunglasses on. Don't. That is a major no. Taking your glass like keep your [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3364.1600000000003s)]
*  glasses on guy, you know, and then just offer to get everybody something to eat or whatever. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3373.6000000000004s)]
*  Be totally cool, helpful. Don't be weird, brother. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3380.4s)]
*  But yeah, you know, I think it's OK. But that's it. That's it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3387.44s)]
*  So what else do we got? Man, some of this I forgot how to do, I feel like. But I'm going to get back [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3396.08s)]
*  in the swing of it. My brain's starting to get a little tired. I got a call right here that came in. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3402.7200000000003s)]
*  Hey, my name is Wade. What's up, Wade? Man, thank you for calling, man. I [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3411.28s)]
*  excuse me. I had, you know, when I was a kid, they had a kid in my class named Wade. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3422.0s)]
*  And he was a ginger. And they didn't have they didn't. I don't think even allowed a lot of [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3428.32s)]
*  gingers in our area, but he had gotten in and he was a neat guy. You know, he had a beautiful sister [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3433.68s)]
*  or she could have just been a sister, could have just been his sister. And she was just [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3443.8399999999997s)]
*  I was at that age where if any if a dude had a sister, it was like she's beautiful, you know. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3447.2s)]
*  And I was the word I remember I just got at that age, I was the worst at talking to women. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3454.64s)]
*  I mean, and I still am. But at that time, I had really [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3460.48s)]
*  my buddy would like if I had a friend was like, hey, man, you should go talk to that girl. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3464.56s)]
*  I would immediately not only would I not walk over and talk to the girl, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3467.92s)]
*  I would run 15 miles in the other direction. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3471.76s)]
*  I would. And then when I got there, I would start writing letters to the girl [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3477.6s)]
*  and telling her how I missed her. And I wish things could be different and all. Just create just. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3482.4s)]
*  I was just I've always been a bizarre. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3487.04s)]
*  Relationship is in a way, but like, dude, that girl's looking at you should go talk to her. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3491.84s)]
*  I will fucking take one step towards her, then 7000 steps the other way. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3497.84s)]
*  And then when I get over there, I start drawing paintings of her. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3502.16s)]
*  I'll take art classes, all that kind of shit. But yeah, I was always had trouble talking to women. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3505.04s)]
*  But anyway, but now it's not as bad, but it's still a little bit of a problem. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3510.08s)]
*  It's still not cool. But Wade had a sister, I remember her name. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3516.56s)]
*  I think she damn looked like him. I don't even know, but it didn't matter. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3522.16s)]
*  It didn't even damn matter. And Wade was cool. He was interesting. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3527.68s)]
*  Pale to God so pale you could fucking see his heart trying. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3535.68s)]
*  Damn, some days you did be like, damn, you got to. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3541.04s)]
*  You better pluck that thing a couple of times. Wade, we're about to play basketball. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3546.4s)]
*  You know, you're going to need it. But anyway, go on, man. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3549.92s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt your call with my bullshit. Let me start your call over a little. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3553.92s)]
*  Oh, my name is Wade. I'm a college student. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3556.88s)]
*  You're a college student. OK, onward. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3561.44s)]
*  I don't mean to like bring you down or anything, but [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3564.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, you were pretty real about your mental health and stuff. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3566.4s)]
*  And I just, you know, I'm just calling to kind of wonder if you ever felt like you were like [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3572.0s)]
*  just always fighting yourself and you just don't know why. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3578.56s)]
*  And you kind of just, but I just know I'm losing, you know, or you know you're losing. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3582.88s)]
*  Yeah, if I was always fighting myself and I didn't know why, but I was always losing. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3588.8s)]
*  Yeah, let's hear more. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3596.48s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the call, man. I appreciate it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3620.88s)]
*  Yeah, I can relate in the way that I just appreciate you caring about yourself enough [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3623.92s)]
*  to call and see what's going on and just share it. You know, neither one of us probably has a [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3632.56s)]
*  has an answer, but we can share about what's going on. And then at least now both of us, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3637.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, if you're carrying a burden by yourself, if you share it with somebody else, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3644.96s)]
*  now two people are carrying it, you know, and it's lighter. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3648.4s)]
*  You know, I was always in conflict with myself, always. If I was working, I wasn't working. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3653.6s)]
*  I should have been having fun or I wasn't working hard enough. If I was having fun, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3658.1600000000003s)]
*  I'd be like, God, I gotta, I gotta go to work. I never let myself win. That's what I realized. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3662.2400000000002s)]
*  I never let myself win. So I was always in conflict, always. I was never doing anything right. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3669.6s)]
*  I was never doing anything right. And then I realized that I had my perspective was off. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3676.4s)]
*  I had, I had made unrealistic expectations for myself. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3682.0s)]
*  And I made unrealistic expectations for myself because if I could never get things right, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3687.6s)]
*  then that means that I'm always wrong. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3697.6800000000003s)]
*  And if I'm always wrong, then that attaches to whatever my core belief about myself, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3699.36s)]
*  one of my core beliefs, like something I think real deep down inside myself. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3704.56s)]
*  One of the things I thought was that I'm always wrong. I can't do anything right. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3709.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm never enough, right? Those were core beliefs that I had for me. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3714.4s)]
*  And so by having unrealistic expectations, I set myself up always to fail because I never [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3718.96s)]
*  could achieve my own expectations. They were always impossible. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3725.6s)]
*  So then once I fail, which is all the time, it attaches back to the old feeling of, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3730.0s)]
*  well, I'm not enough, right? So then it's like almost a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3735.52s)]
*  So I'm not saying that's what's going on with you, but if you're never enough for yourself, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3744.8s)]
*  then you might want to talk to a therapist about some of what your core beliefs are and how do you [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3750.1600000000003s)]
*  find out what those are because that's where I've had to start looking for myself. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3755.92s)]
*  And then also, I think stay in action, stay in action. Stay moving, whether it's that you jog [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3763.2000000000003s)]
*  or you go for a walk or if you like to go to the gym. Those things are important because otherwise [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3771.36s)]
*  you get like, your body is sedentary and if it's sedentary, you're going to be even more like glum [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3775.52s)]
*  and depressed. It's so much easier for depression to grow on you if you're not a moving target. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3781.92s)]
*  So staying in motion, I think helps. Not all the time. Don't sleep on like a treadmill or anything, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3790.0s)]
*  but just stay busy, keep your blood going. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3795.6s)]
*  I don't know if that's helpful or not, but then it was like I wasn't always in conflict with myself [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3798.56s)]
*  because I would never let myself win. That was the thing. I was never good enough for myself [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3803.84s)]
*  and no one else was ever good enough for me. I just had unrealistic expectations, man. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3809.7599999999998s)]
*  So I'm not feeling like I'm going to be able to do anything. I'm not feeling like I'm going to be [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3820.32s)]
*  able to do anything. So I'm not feeling bad about it or anything. I'm happy that I'm able to see it. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3825.28s)]
*  I haven't cured it for myself or anything like that, but I at least have a look at it now [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3830.8s)]
*  and I'm at least now able to, when I pray, I'm able to ask God, say, hey God, help me to see [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3834.96s)]
*  my unrealistic expectations. Help me to make those more, bring those into the light for me [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3839.92s)]
*  so that I can see where they show up. Yeah, that's all I got really on that, man. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3845.36s)]
*  And give yourself some grace too. Just don't be so hard on yourself, man. I'm sure you're doing a [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3852.64s)]
*  lot, but don't get caught in self-pity. That was something that happened to me for a long time. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3859.04s)]
*  I was in self-pity. I always had a problem. And if I always have a problem and everything is wrong [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3864.56s)]
*  and everything, then that's self-pity because that's not the reality of things. The reality of things [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3870.8799999999997s)]
*  is that there's possibility everywhere somehow. But if I'm always playing the victim of myself [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3878.16s)]
*  and stuff and then when I'm talking with people, then it's like I'm getting into self-pity. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3884.24s)]
*  And I'm not judging you with that. I'm just saying, just look out for it. I fell into it [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3890.32s)]
*  for a long time and fuck, I was a fucking shit. Had this shit all over my fucking knees, dude. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3894.64s)]
*  I was in self-pity so much, bro. Damn dummy. But it's okay. I didn't know, you know, and I'm just [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3900.64s)]
*  grateful now that I have a little bit more wherewithal when I see it. What else, man? Can [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3907.36s)]
*  we get anything else? That might be a lot for today. Yeah, some of this is so love. So I almost [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3914.88s)]
*  have to learn how to do it again. I'm sorry that I took so long off of it. But there's just some [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3921.2000000000003s)]
*  other things to get in a row. We've been able to have more guests and I want to be able to have [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3929.2000000000003s)]
*  people that I can learn from. You know, sometimes it's nice to have people that I can laugh with [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3933.04s)]
*  and sometimes it's nice to have people that I can learn from. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3937.7599999999998s)]
*  So that's been cool. You know, we have an anger guy coming up. We had this [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3942.96s)]
*  episode with Tim Fletcher that was really interesting. And then there's just been a [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3947.6s)]
*  lot of stuff going on in the background of just trying to figure things out, trying to grow up. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3954.16s)]
*  You know, I've always been kind of like a late bloomer, I think. And, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3960.48s)]
*  yeah, and just finding out how do I get to, how do I, you know, one day I'd like to be in a [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3968.56s)]
*  successful relationship and it's something that I've always struggled with. And I'm okay, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3974.56s)]
*  I'm not complaining about it. I'm just looking at it, right? I'm looking at it and I'm looking to [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3979.44s)]
*  see, do I want to really do the work that it's going to take to get myself into a place to be [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3984.64s)]
*  good at something like that? Because it's practice. It's all not actual practice with someone, but [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3989.36s)]
*  I mean, it is some of that for me, but it's like just creating a level of integrity with myself [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=3995.84s)]
*  so that I'm only putting myself in scenarios that are, have a lot of upside and value, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4007.44s)]
*  you know, and you can't always know off the bat, but sometimes you know, like, oh, this isn't [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4014.48s)]
*  you know, this isn't really, this isn't going to make me feel anything, but maybe bad, you know? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4019.92s)]
*  So what else? Anything in the news? You know, they just had the Kyle. They were trying to have the [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4028.6400000000003s)]
*  most Kyles ever in Kyle, Texas. So I want to jump on the line with, I want to get on the line here [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4036.0s)]
*  with a Kyle who was there. You know, apparently they came up a little bit short over there. Let [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4044.2400000000002s)]
*  me see the number they were trying to get. Well, I guess we can learn it all about here from this [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4049.76s)]
*  Kyle right here. I want to talk to this Kyle and this is a Kyle and he was at the Kyle Fest 2024 [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4054.0800000000004s)]
*  over in Kyle, Texas, which is only about 20 miles from here in Austin. And so I'm really interested [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4063.76s)]
*  in seeing how that went and what went on down there. This right here, we have Kyle Garcia, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4072.08s)]
*  if he's available here, Kyle Garcia. Hey, Kyle. Hi. Hey brother. Can you see me? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4077.7599999999998s)]
*  I can see you. Nice man. Thank you for your patience. And I can hear you. Yeah, for sure. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4085.84s)]
*  No worries. Excellent. And so you attended the Kyle Fest over there in Kyle, Texas. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4090.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was the craziest, most Kyle charged weekend I've ever spent. It was really cool. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4097.12s)]
*  And what was the goal of the festival? Just so we know. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4105.68s)]
*  For sure. So I think there's a current world record of the most amount of people with the same name [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4109.84s)]
*  in Bosnia with the name Ivan. And that's like something in the 2100, 2200, something like that. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4118.320000000001s)]
*  So in order to beat that record, we needed 22 something hundred Kyles. And we fell a little [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4127.92s)]
*  short, but we had a lot of fun. And this was the second year they did it? I think they've been [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4135.52s)]
*  doing it for four or five years now. And from what I understand, the last year was their biggest [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4142.08s)]
*  turnout. And that's actually the year that I found out about it. Last year's turnout was 1400. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4149.04s)]
*  And this year's turnout was 706 officially. Oh, yeah. Not as many cows. Were you expecting a [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4155.5199999999995s)]
*  larger amount of Kyles? I was thinking it was going to happen. I didn't really, you know, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4163.92s)]
*  the reason I went is because the place I work at, there's three Kyles of us together. So I felt [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4172.96s)]
*  emboldened. I felt like, all right, we might actually get this done. Might be part of world [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4179.68s)]
*  history. Yes. And to some extent, so I didn't think it would be half. Did you go as a group, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4183.36s)]
*  you three Kyles? Oh, I solo tripped. The other Kyles couldn't make it, but I knew about it for [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4190.48s)]
*  a while. I knew about it since last year and I feel like I was the only Kyle that was like kind [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4196.719999999999s)]
*  of eyeing it. Wow. Okay. And so what were some of the festivities when you got down there? Were [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4200.719999999999s)]
*  there, was there like a pledge of allegiance? Was there, were you guys doing like a pickleball or [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4206.799999999999s)]
*  any? The coolest thing, there was a drone show on the final night. And that was my first time [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4213.28s)]
*  seeing a drone show. So it was really cool to go out and see that. And actually, yeah, from Friday [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4221.76s)]
*  to Sunday, there was live music. There were two stages, which I thought was pretty cool. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4227.12s)]
*  And it was all free, free to attend. Wow. You didn't have to be a Kyle to like participate, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4232.56s)]
*  to take part, to get food and drinks, to have fun. So it was really cool. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4238.8s)]
*  And someone said Kyle Rittenhouse was there. Was that, is that? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4244.72s)]
*  Let's see. I didn't catch or hear any famous Kyles come through. I wish there were more Kyles. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4248.96s)]
*  I think we just generally wanted more Kyles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like you want to get as much [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4260.240000000001s)]
*  Kyles as you can. And do you blame, was there a reason you think in hindsight, like, okay, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4265.04s)]
*  this would have led us to more Kyles? This is why we felt short. Yeah. Like we talked about it. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4271.28s)]
*  We discussed it. Like why, you know, what, what we think is what happened. And I think the general [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4276.8s)]
*  consensus is maybe marketing had something to do with it. Advertising, maybe a certain amount of [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4282.08s)]
*  advertising was needed to get everyone's attention, to keep it on everyone's mind. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4288.08s)]
*  Maybe like a certain influencer, probably could have pushed things along more. I know that the [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4293.76s)]
*  city put a lot of effort into it. I mean, with the drone show and two stages, it was really cool. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4299.28s)]
*  Yeah. But yeah, I feel like a word of mouth really goes a long way in sort of, in a sense like this. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4305.6s)]
*  Yeah. Well, next year we'll have to read some ads or something, do something we can to try to support [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4312.24s)]
*  these Kyles. And what type, was it all men or are there women Kyles allowed as well? Do you see? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4316.24s)]
*  There were women Kyles, there were married Kyles. There were, there were Kyles of all sorts. I mean, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4322.72s)]
*  what was really cool was to see really small, tiny, teeny tiny toddler Kyles, you know, baby Kyles. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4331.04s)]
*  You know, it was, it was, it was awesome. It was really cool. I never met so many Kyles, you know, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4337.52s)]
*  it felt like a kinship. Oh, it did feel like that. Yeah. Yeah. It felt cool. I mean, the hardest part [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4343.4400000000005s)]
*  was, you know, hearing your name, you turn your head. That was the hardest part, the head turning [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4351.36s)]
*  part. Someone says a nice hat, Kyle, or I'm looking for Kyle, or, you know, you're in big trouble Kyle. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4356.48s)]
*  And we're all like, yes, ma'am. Yeah. Well, this is your baby, Kyle. Yeah. But that's what was part [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4363.839999999999s)]
*  of the fun, you know. Oh, that's super enjoyable. And was there a lot of, is it a place where is [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4372.88s)]
*  there a lot of like, did it seem like a hot bed? I was reading somewhere online that it seemed like [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4377.84s)]
*  a hot bed of like kind of like men meeting men. Was there any of that energy there? Do you feel [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4384.96s)]
*  like any dating kind of vibes? You know, I feel like I wouldn't want to find the, the, the love [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4390.32s)]
*  of my life with also the same name, you know, Kyle meeting Kyle. And, and to be honest, yeah, I guess [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4398.88s)]
*  I definitely saw the ratio. I guess I saw more guy Kyle's, you know, and I, to be completely [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4406.56s)]
*  honest with you, I wasn't, I wasn't really going, I was all by myself, you know, solo tripping and, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4414.64s)]
*  and it was my first time out in Texas. Wow. There was so much to do, you know. And so, and everyone [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4419.6s)]
*  was awesome. Everyone was really nice and friendly and welcoming too. Yeah. Yeah. I was just wondering [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv62S5atRmE&t=4428.080000000001s)]
