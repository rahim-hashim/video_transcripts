*  to spend time with us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=21.54s)]
*  Today's guest is Mr. Cat Williams. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=22.64s)]
*  I'm off the stage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=26.08s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=27.08s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=28.08s)]
*  It's time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=29.08s)]
*  It's good to see good old Theo Vine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=30.08s)]
*  It's an honor, man. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=33.08s)]
*  The world loves you, you know? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=34.08s)]
*  Well, that's nice of you to say. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=36.08s)]
*  I feel like, you know, I'm a little bit of a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=38.08s)]
*  I feel like I can't believe I'm around you, I think. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=55.08s)]
*  You know, I feel like you seem like a mythical figure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=58.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=64.08s)]
*  Well, you know, like a sack squash or like a unicorn [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=65.08s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=74.08s)]
*  Yeah, you'll still feel that way by the end. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=77.08s)]
*  Like I won't ruin that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=80.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=82.08s)]
*  That's the good thing about people like you and I. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=83.08s)]
*  Like if somebody thinks that they like us [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=87.08s)]
*  and they think they've made a connection [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=91.08s)]
*  with this person on the screen, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=94.08s)]
*  when they're around us, it's legitimate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=97.08s)]
*  because it was legitimate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=102.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=104.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=105.08s)]
*  Like if Theo Vine wasn't successful, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=106.08s)]
*  he doesn't have a different story. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=110.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=112.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=113.08s)]
*  It's the same story. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=115.08s)]
*  He lived that story. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=116.08s)]
*  And that's why people gravitate to you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=118.08s)]
*  because there's nobody like you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=123.08s)]
*  Well, thanks, man. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=126.08s)]
*  I feel the same about you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  I feel like everybody does. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  And you have a statue of me at your house. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  So, you know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=136.07999999999998s)]

*  Yeah, thank you for letting them even do that statue. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=138.08s)]
*  What was that whole deal like with them, with Michaels? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=140.08s)]
*  That's where I got mine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=142.08s)]
*  That was at Michaels. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=143.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=144.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=145.08s)]
*  Did you do a, it wasn't a collab or what was it? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=146.08s)]
*  No. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=149.08s)]
*  No, they just robbed my image and likeness [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=150.08s)]
*  because they could. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=156.08s)]
*  They messed it up, man. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=158.08s)]
*  Because they were doing it for religious purposes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=160.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=163.08s)]
*  I allowed it to be. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=164.08s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=166.08s)]

*  Hey, man. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=169.08s)]

*  I'd be honored to have one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=172.08s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=174.08s)]
*  Because, yeah, when I met that guy there, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=175.08s)]
*  he said, we got two left, man, you know. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=177.08s)]
*  And there was 201 of them was marked down [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=179.08s)]
*  because they had a chip in it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=181.08s)]
*  But it's still, man, it's an honor. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=183.08s)]
*  I keep it up in my house year round. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=186.08s)]
*  And people walk in and they're like, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=188.08s)]
*  no way, that's Cat William right there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=190.08s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=192.08s)]
*  And it's beautiful, man. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=193.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=194.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=195.08s)]
*  You have a new tour, man. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=196.08s)]
*  And I know people talk about touring and comedy a lot. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=198.08s)]
*  And I want to know what kind of keeps you still doing comedy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=201.08s)]
*  Like, did you, like, because I think when we start out, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=205.08s)]
*  maybe it's to be funny. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=208.08s)]
*  And then some people get to this place [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=209.08s)]
*  where they want to have a message. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=211.08s)]
*  Do you notice that kind of tone shift in your, like, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=213.08s)]
*  desire to do it over time? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=216.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=219.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=222.08s)]
*  Like, I always try to have a message [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=223.08s)]
*  just because I enjoy the fact that while laughing and joking, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=230.08s)]
*  you might learn something you didn't know [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=236.08s)]
*  and have gotten it from a comedian. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=240.08s)]
*  And I kind of dig that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=243.08s)]
*  But everything else is just continuing this conversation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=246.08s)]
*  With my fan base, like, these are my friends that I haven't seen [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=250.08s)]
*  since the last time I was here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=254.08s)]
*  And here's our discussion furthering our relationship. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=256.08000000000004s)]
*  So it hasn't felt much like work. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  And is the Heaven on Earth Tour, do you believe in heaven? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  And earth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, all right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  Fair. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=278.08s)]
*  Touche, man. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=279.08s)]
*  Dude, I remember when I first, because when I was growing up, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=280.08s)]
*  we just had, you know, you learned about heaven and stuff, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=285.08s)]
*  but all the fan flits or whatever I'd seen at church or anything, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=288.08s)]
*  it always had, it was mostly white folks on it, right? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=291.08s)]
*  And then I went to a black church one time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=294.08s)]
*  It was, I think it was called Greater Starlight Baptist Church. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=298.08s)]
*  That was in our town. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=302.08s)]
*  And shout out to Greater Starlight Baptist Church. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=304.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was nice in there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=308.08s)]
*  This was in Covington, Louisiana. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=310.08s)]
*  But yeah, they had about 13 miles from Slidell. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=312.08s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=317.08s)]
*  Wow, Mapp Williams in the building, baby. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=321.08s)]
*  But, and that's when I realized, oh, everybody's... [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=327.08s)]
*  That's when I realized, oh, everybody's going to be in heaven. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=334.08s)]
*  That was the first time that I realized heaven was going to be very diverse. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=338.08s)]
*  I'd never thought about it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=341.08s)]
*  And it blew my mind. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=343.08s)]
*  I was like, oh, wow, they're going to have black folks in heaven, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=345.08s)]
*  Asian folks, all types of folks are going to be there, you know? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=347.08s)]
*  It's truly the only place that white people are a minority is in heaven. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=352.08s)]
*  Just because thousands of years went with nobody getting to go. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=359.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=364.08s)]
*  Just because of fuck shit that they might not have even been involved in. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=365.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=371.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=372.08s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I'm kind of, I don't know if I'm starting to look forward to it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=373.08s)]
*  I am excited about it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=376.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=377.08s)]
*  But yeah, I guess I get caught up in like a lot of worldly stuff, you know? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=378.08s)]
*  Like there's still things I want to do here, that type of thing, you know? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=382.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=385.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=386.08s)]
*  You still got stuff you haven't done? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=387.08s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=389.08s)]
*  I got some things, yeah, some different things. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=390.08s)]
*  I would like to write a book, I think. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=392.08s)]
*  Don't say what they are. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=394.08s)]
*  But I'm saying just the fact that you got things that you're excited about doing, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=395.08s)]
*  that's the joy of life. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=401.08s)]
*  That's when you're living. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=404.08s)]
*  That's why it's so difficult for these super wealthy people to be fucking happy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=408.08s)]
*  They can do everything else, but they can't fucking be happy because they've lived all their dreams. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=415.08s)]
*  They got everything they were trying to get. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=421.08s)]
*  They wake up and they can't score a touchdown no matter what. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=424.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=429.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's a terrible life. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=430.08s)]
*  But guys like you and I, that still got stuff to try and taste and, you know, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=432.08s)]
*  things to feel and people to be around. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=439.08s)]
*  It gives life a wonderful meaning. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=443.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=447.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think that is something that, like, if I stay kind of motivated and I have a plan a little bit, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=448.08s)]
*  that keeps me a lot more like, okay, I want to do this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=453.08s)]
*  I still want to try that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=456.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=458.08s)]
*  And I start to think, man, I'm running out of time, too. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=460.08s)]
*  You know, if you really like to taste different things and smell different flowers and, you know, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=462.08s)]
*  and see what's in different gardens and stuff, then you start to run out of time. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=467.08s)]
*  No. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=473.08s)]
*  You don't think? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=474.08s)]
*  No, because you had to be in the position that you're in now for you to be able to make some of these things happen. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=475.08s)]
*  Couldn't have done them at 34, 24, 14 because, circumstantially, you weren't ready. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=486.08s)]
*  You weren't ready financially. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=493.08s)]
*  You didn't have the time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=495.08s)]
*  You didn't know that's what you wanted to do. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=496.08s)]
*  Now at this place is when you can make those things happen. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=499.08s)]
*  Like, you can do everything on that list of yours in 2025 with no fucking sweat. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=503.08s)]
*  And your biggest problem in 26 is, I got to have a new list. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=509.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  Time is one of the main things that's made up. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you think? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  So it's just used as like a mechanism to what? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=525.08s)]
*  Limit our thinking? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=528.08s)]
*  Well, don't say limit. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=529.08s)]
*  You said that you like this thing because it gives control and it puts things in its place. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=530.08s)]
*  And that's what time does for us so that we're able to keep track, you know. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=539.08s)]
*  But the less you deal with time, you realize you have the right amount of time to do everything you got to do every day. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=544.08s)]
*  24 hours. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=556.08s)]
*  And you could make it an adventure every fucking day. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=558.08s)]
*  Like, hey, I could die tomorrow. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=562.08s)]
*  What would that mean I would need to be doing today? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=565.08s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=569.08s)]
*  I'm not looking at it like, oh, I'm running out of time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=571.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=574.08s)]
*  Dead people ran out of time. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=575.08s)]
*  Everybody else alive. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=578.08s)]
*  You got 30 swim trunks. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=583.08s)]
*  Do that for me. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=584.08s)]
*  How you going to say you got 30 swim trunks but you ain't never been in the ocean, Joe Rogan? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=588.08s)]
*  Thank you for having a good sense of humor, man. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=596.08s)]
*  That's what I am. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=600.08s)]
*  I am a good sense of humor. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=601.08s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes we forget about that along the way, man. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=604.08s)]
*  You are. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=606.08s)]
*  How long you want to live for it then you think, Kat? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=607.08s)]
*  You got to check out, you got to, when you ever think about it? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=609.08s)]
*  I was promised that I won't have to deal with that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=616.08s)]
*  So I don't consider it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=620.08s)]
*  I do know that, yeah, I don't have any things that I have to do in order to go out the way I would like. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=627.08s)]
*  So that's a blessing. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=645.08s)]
*  And about one of the best you can get is being okay with the body of work and the legacy and feelings and the emotions that you left. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=647.08s)]
*  And I still haven't done my best. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=662.08s)]
*  Like comedically, I'm still not my funniest. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=666.08s)]
*  Like I'm still not working hard enough. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=672.08s)]
*  Like I'm still not, I still haven't made a complete package of myself yet. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=675.08s)]
*  Do you think some comedians start to feel like they have and that that's a trap? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=684.08s)]
*  Most comedians have though. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=689.08s)]
*  I'm saying that becomes part of the career is the fact that a lot of guys that are doing comedy right now were funny. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=691.08s)]
*  Were funny from 1995 to 2004. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=701.08s)]
*  They're still working. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=707.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=709.08s)]
*  They're still generating income. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=710.08s)]
*  They're still, but their best comedy is long behind them. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=712.08s)]
*  They're not that comedian that was thinking something was funny and writing it down and figuring a way to get this to the people. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=717.08s)]
*  And so, yeah, it happens. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=727.08s)]
*  What sidetracks can comedians, I guess it could be all types of things, huh? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=730.08s)]
*  What sidetracks them from maybe fulfilling their... [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=735.08s)]
*  Excellence is difficult. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=740.08s)]
*  But to be mediocre, it's no pressure. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=743.08s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=746.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=748.08s)]
*  Like if you don't feel like you have to be the funniest person that this crowd has seen tonight, then you don't. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=749.08s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=758.08s)]
*  Nobody's going to jam you up about it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=761.08s)]
*  They'll go, oh, you were funny. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=763.08s)]
*  And for a lot of people, that's enough. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=766.08s)]
*  How do you pick on... [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=770.08s)]
*  You've had a lot of openers like I've met a lot of your openers over the years here and there. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=772.08s)]
*  How do you choose them, man? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=777.08s)]
*  How do you choose these guys or women? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=779.08s)]
*  You need a lighter? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=784.08s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=785.08s)]
*  I have no need to apologize. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=786.08s)]
*  I choose them based upon whether their point of view is unique to them. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=790.08s)]
*  Like, I don't care what a comedian's talking about. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=800.08s)]
*  That's your business. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=803.08s)]
*  I don't care what jokes you're making or how your set flows. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=804.08s)]
*  But are you telling a story about you? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=809.08s)]
*  Can people see this eight minutes, 12 minutes you're going to do and know you and have a chance to like you? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=813.08s)]
*  If you do that, then you can open for me because my allegiance is to the people out there in those seats. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=824.08s)]
*  And I want them to see the very best comedians that I can possibly bring. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=833.08s)]
*  Somebody they'll enjoy, whether they're male or female or white or black. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=839.08s)]
*  Do they come to work? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=844.08s)]
*  Do they have a show for you? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=847.08s)]
*  You see? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=849.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=850.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I care about. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=851.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think when I was getting into comedy in the beginning, I didn't... [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=853.08s)]
*  I wanted people to know me, right? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=858.08s)]
*  Like, I never... [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=860.08s)]
*  I like the jokes and I want them to laugh and feel good and see different ways that maybe I think and stuff. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=861.08s)]
*  But I wanted to sell myself. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=868.08s)]
*  That's what I always thought, I think. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=870.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=872.08s)]
*  When I first started, I didn't think I... [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=873.08s)]
*  I don't want you to remember one joke. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=874.08s)]
*  I want you to remember me, right? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=876.08s)]
*  Like I felt like this desperate... [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=877.08s)]
*  That's a star though. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=879.08s)]
*  See, you knew that you would be a star. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=881.08s)]
*  That's different than a performer. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=883.08s)]
*  A performer is based upon the act. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=888.08s)]
*  What I'm saying is, magicians ain't shit unless they doing magic. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=891.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=895.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=896.08s)]
*  Oh, if I see them bitches, yeah, I feel... [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=897.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=899.08s)]
*  Bro, come on. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=900.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=901.08s)]
*  But a true comedian is above the comedy material. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=902.08s)]
*  The jokes are secondary. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=908.08s)]
*  We like this guy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=911.08s)]
*  And we want to hear what this guy has chosen to say to us about the topics of his choosing. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=914.08s)]
*  That's who you are. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=922.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=923.08s)]
*  That's who you are. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=924.08s)]
*  That's who you are, Kat. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=925.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=926.08s)]
*  Well, it takes one to know one. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=927.08s)]
*  Yeah, you grew up in Ohio, huh? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=929.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=936.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=937.08s)]
*  Did you grow up by Dave Chappelle? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=938.08s)]
*  You guys grew up near each other. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=939.08s)]
*  Dave Chappelle's not even from Ohio. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=940.08s)]
*  Isn't he? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=943.08s)]
*  I thought he's from Dayton. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=944.08s)]
*  I'm from Dayton. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=945.08s)]
*  Are you really? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=947.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=948.08s)]
*  Chappelle's from D.C. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=949.08s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=950.08s)]
*  My bad. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=951.08s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=952.08s)]
*  No problem. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=953.08s)]
*  But he lives in Dayton now though. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=954.08s)]
*  He has a lot of, he owns probably $5 million worth of property out there. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=955.08s)]
*  Dang. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=960.08s)]
*  He's done really well for our Dayton, Ohio. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=961.08s)]
*  They got a beautiful museum out there I went to. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=963.08s)]
*  Dayton's a wonderful place. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=966.08s)]
*  They have the Air Force Museum, I think it is out there. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=969.08s)]
*  Yeah, because we have Wright-Patterson Air Force Base that we're very, very proud of. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=972.08s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=978.08s)]
*  Yeah, they have, I think Fat Man and Little Boy are in there. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=979.08s)]
*  Is it the, or the plane that dropped, there's a plane that dropped the bombs on, I want [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=982.08s)]
*  to say it's, I want to say it's Pearl Harbor in there maybe? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=990.08s)]
*  Hiroshima. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=995.08s)]
*  It could be Hiroshima. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=996.08s)]
*  Little Boy and Fat Man. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=998.08s)]
*  There they are. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1000.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Rogan named his, the rooms of his comedy club after. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1003.08s)]
*  He certainly did. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1007.08s)]
*  The mothership. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1008.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1009.08s)]
*  They really get it over there. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1010.08s)]
*  You feeling the pressure? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1012.08s)]
*  Of this interview? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1015.08s)]
*  No, no, of Austin. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1016.08s)]
*  Of moving there? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1018.08s)]
*  Is Austin calling you? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1019.08s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1021.08s)]
*  Are they trying to put pressure on you? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1022.08s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1023.08s)]
*  I didn't, like at first I wanted to do my own thing, like a lot of people were moving there. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1024.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1027.08s)]
*  But now when I'm there it just feels like it's a fun energy. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1028.08s)]
*  It is. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1031.08s)]
*  And there's people on stage and you can go up and down that sixth street and you can do [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1032.08s)]
*  five or six sets in a night. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1036.08s)]
*  I mean that's a lot of practice and it's probably within 800 footsteps or whatever. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1040.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1045.08s)]
*  So that to me seems really remarkable. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1046.08s)]
*  What's on the new tour, what's it like? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1049.08s)]
*  Like what's it like to still go out there? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1052.08s)]
*  What's it like to like, do you do in the round? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1054.08s)]
*  What's your show like? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1056.08s)]
*  I've been to a Cat Williams show. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1057.08s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1060.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1061.08s)]
*  And what a blessing, you know what I mean? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1062.08s)]
*  That's true. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1063.08s)]
*  And you still have it to look forward to. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1064.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1065.08s)]
*  And we just learned we got plenty of time, you know. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1066.08s)]
*  But it's like, I don't know, it's like a festival for laughs and good energy. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1070.08s)]
*  And there are different comedians before it gets to me. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1084.08s)]
*  And so you get a chance to get an overview of some of the greatest comedians around the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1091.08s)]
*  country and get a chance to see them. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1104.08s)]
*  And it's hosted by Monique. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1108.08s)]
*  And Monique is a super large figure in comedy. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1111.08s)]
*  And she has a great presence. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1118.08s)]
*  And then after all of said and done, then I come out and I congregate with the people [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1121.08s)]
*  for an hour. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1132.08s)]
*  And yeah, the best thing I think is probably the fact that you've gotten your money's worth [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1134.08s)]
*  twice before I get on stage. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1139.08s)]
*  And I think that's the part I'm probably proudest of. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1142.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1145.08s)]
*  What do you bring with you on the road? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1147.08s)]
*  Somebody said you bring a Cybertruck. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1149.08s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1151.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1155.08s)]
*  That's my work truck. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1156.08s)]
*  I have a Cybertruck. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1158.08s)]
*  That's why I was just curious what you thought about it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1159.08s)]
*  When I'm home on the ranch, that's my farm truck. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1161.08s)]
*  I love it. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1168.08s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1170.08s)]
*  It feels like you're driving an email kind of. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1171.08s)]
*  A what? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1173.08s)]
*  It feels like you're driving an email. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1174.08s)]
*  That's what I feel like sometimes. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1175.08s)]
*  It just feels like I'm in the future. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1177.08s)]
*  Like you could floor it and just. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1180.08s)]
*  Yeah, it does feel like a UFO. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1182.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1184.08s)]
*  Like you'll put the gas on Monday. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1185.08s)]
*  Like you'll floor it and you'll fucking. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1186.08s)]
*  When it stops, it's fucking Thursday right there. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1188.08s)]
*  It's like it just has like a. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1190.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1192.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's a unique experience. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1194.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1200.08s)]

*  No, I don't. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1204.08s)]
*  I don't generally enjoy the company of billionaires. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1205.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1213.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think if I know any good billionaires. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1214.08s)]
*  Well, it's not that they're not good, but I'm saying. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1218.08s)]
*  I don't need to be reminded of my inadequacies. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1221.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1225.08s)]

*  What you do for fitness, man? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1230.08s)]
*  What's your fitness regime like? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1232.08s)]
*  You got a regime each day or what's that like? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1234.08s)]
*  The ladies keep me fit. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1237.08s)]
*  I'm heavy in sexual relations. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1239.08s)]
*  And so. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1241.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1242.08s)]
*  That keeps you pretty, pretty fit. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1243.08s)]
*  I got a cold plunge and a jacuzzi and a sauna that I do pretty ritualistic. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1246.08s)]
*  I've never been a gym guy. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1254.08s)]
*  I got two torn rotator cuffs. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1260.08s)]
*  So that kind of limits me. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1262.08s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1263.08s)]
*  Both them bitches go on, huh? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1264.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1265.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1266.08s)]
*  So golf is basically how I stay where I'm trying to be. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1267.08s)]
*  But I've never been seven pounds under or over in my life. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1272.08s)]
*  You're that middle dog. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1281.08s)]
*  I'm that dog. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1282.08s)]
*  I'm at 150. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1283.08s)]
*  On the dime, baby, he'll show up. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1284.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1287.08s)]
*  He'll fucking checkmate a scale, baby. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1288.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1290.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1292.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1293.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1294.08s)]
*  I think I like, what have I been doing recently? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1295.08s)]
*  Swimming. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1297.08s)]
*  Oh, there's you playing golf right there. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1298.08s)]
*  Damn, kid, out there. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1299.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1302.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1304.08s)]
*  So if you can get 222 without your arms ever going above your head and do it consistently, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1305.08s)]
*  where it always ends up in the fairway, you're hitting 14, 16 of 18 in the fairway, then [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1314.08s)]
*  you can play the game a little better. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1325.08s)]
*  You're banging out there. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1327.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1329.08s)]
*  You can't get them arms. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1330.08s)]
*  At a certain point, your arms don't need to go that high in the air anyway, though. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1331.08s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what I... [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1334.08s)]
*  Well, it would certainly give me more yards and a fuller thing. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1335.08s)]
*  It's just the rotator cuffs don't allow it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1342.08s)]
*  So I started golfing with these 80-year-old guys that... [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1347.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1352.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1353.08s)]
*  Them bitches, you got to wait. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1354.08s)]
*  You got to wait. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1355.08s)]
*  They can barely get out the car, but then they come out there and out-drive you every [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1356.08s)]
*  shot is better than your life. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1360.08s)]
*  So they taught me how to play golf under restraint so as to not hurt myself. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1362.08s)]
*  And how'd you bang them cuffs up? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1371.08s)]
*  What happened, you think? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1374.08s)]
*  What you mean? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1375.08s)]
*  How'd you... [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1376.08s)]
*  Oh, I was in the midst of a push-up contest. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1377.08s)]
*  No way. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1385.08s)]
*  You blew them out. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1386.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1387.08s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1388.08s)]
*  But I was probably at 200. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1389.08s)]
*  I was doing too much. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1392.08s)]
*  You did 200 push-ups? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1394.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1396.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1397.08s)]
*  And tore the cuffs both. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1398.08s)]
*  You ripped both them bitches, man. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1400.08s)]
*  God dang, boy. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1403.08s)]
*  You better pull up at a Jiffy Lube and get well, buddy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1405.08s)]
*  I understand the guy I'm going against because the way it worked is you could do as many [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1409.08s)]
*  as you wanted. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1415.08s)]
*  When you stop, it's my go and I got to match. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1416.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1419.08s)]
*  So... [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1420.08s)]
*  You took it to the limits, huh? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1421.08s)]
*  He was a horse. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1423.08s)]
*  You took it to the limits, man. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1425.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1428.08s)]
*  Maybe you could probably do some swimming safely. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1429.08s)]
*  Maybe I could see you get... [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1430.08s)]
*  Oh, I'm an avid water guy. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1431.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1433.08s)]
*  I'm in the water probably more than... [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1434.08s)]
*  You're that dark koi, baby. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1439.08s)]
*  You out there. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1441.08s)]
*  I love the water. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1442.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1443.08s)]
*  I pray underwater because evil can't access you underwater. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1444.08s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1453.08s)]
*  A lot of people don't know. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1454.08s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1456.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1457.08s)]
*  Maybe that's why a baby or a child is an amniotic fluid, huh? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1458.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1462.08s)]
*  Water is super powerful like a living being. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1463.08s)]
*  I'm sure that soon in the future they will confirm for us that water is a sentient being [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1468.08s)]
*  and that... [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1477.08s)]
*  Man, that's going to be if they do that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1480.08s)]
*  Well, that's why all throughout history there was always gods of water just because it's [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1482.08s)]
*  such a powerful force. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1490.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1492.08s)]
*  God is great. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1493.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1495.08s)]
*  I'm just having trouble out there. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1496.08s)]
*  I think I'm just not the best swimmer, man. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1497.08s)]
*  I don't like to swim cap either. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1499.08s)]
*  I never liked putting that cap on. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1501.08s)]
*  That just was not something that was my vibe. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1504.08s)]
*  What do you mean by not a good swimmer? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1507.08s)]
*  I don't like it, man. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1510.08s)]
*  I don't like being out in there. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1512.08s)]
*  I'm kind of a land dog. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1514.08s)]
*  I like being on land. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1515.08s)]
*  I respect water too much. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1517.08s)]
*  I think I get too scared in it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1518.08s)]
*  I just... [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1520.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1521.08s)]
*  That's it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1522.08s)]
*  I get scared in it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1523.08s)]
*  I just have to have a real respect for it no matter what, like on a boat or regardless. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1524.08s)]
*  It's one of those crazy things that is beautiful and wonderful and it sustains life, but it [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1530.08s)]
*  has a thousand ways to kill you. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1539.08s)]
*  And it houses the scariest in the whole world. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1542.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1548.08s)]
*  I just get nervous. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1549.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1550.08s)]
*  But what are you like in a jacuzzi though? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1551.08s)]
*  I'm pretty chill, I think. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1553.08s)]
*  I'm okay in a jacuzzi, but even then if nobody's around, I just don't know if I trust myself [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1554.08s)]
*  or not to... [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1560.08s)]
*  If I'm even driving through a long puddle, I'll look at my watch and make sure everything's [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1563.08s)]
*  all right. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1568.08s)]
*  I just get... [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1569.08s)]
*  But you had a drowning incident in your past? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1570.08s)]
*  I think I've just had some probably nervous experiences with it, man. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1571.08s)]
*  We used to have a neighbor and this guy was probably... [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1574.08s)]
*  I don't know if he was... [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1577.08s)]
*  He had one of them big bathtubs they had at their house and he would make us play Navy [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1578.08s)]
*  or something. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1585.08s)]
*  He's probably a gay guy, but we didn't know, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1586.08s)]
*  But he would have us playing Navy and shit. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1588.08s)]
*  You have more than six of those stories, so you can't... [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1590.08s)]
*  We hate... [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1595.08s)]
*  ...claim it now. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1596.08s)]
*  Yeah, we had well... [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1597.08s)]
*  But he'd have us play... [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1598.08s)]
*  But it was just like a lot of... [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1599.08s)]
*  There was a guy looking and had you looking in butt holes, so I'm saying. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1600.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1604.08s)]
*  Fucking wild neighbors, bro. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1605.08s)]
*  Some of these guys were certain gay. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1608.08s)]
*  I don't know if they was gay. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1611.08s)]
*  I'm not sure what they were. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1613.08s)]
*  We're sure. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1616.08s)]
*  We're sure what they were. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1617.08s)]
*  You just made it through all the gauntlets as a participant. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1620.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, bro. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1624.08s)]
*  I'll fucking... [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1625.08s)]
*  I'll put a juke on a nut sack. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1626.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, bro? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1628.08s)]
*  Give me my $4. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1629.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1630.08s)]
*  Bro, we grew up this adult... [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1634.08s)]
*  But back then they had this more pedophiles and wildness, I think, back then, man. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1635.08s)]
*  People wouldn't... [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1640.08s)]
*  Now it's all documented, you know? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1641.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1643.08s)]
*  But back then it was just... [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1644.08s)]
*  People was more... [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1645.08s)]
*  I remember we had a guy they called... [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1648.08s)]
*  One basketball coach had been kind of tickling the kids a lot, right? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1650.08s)]
*  And then the other guy called him. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1655.08s)]
*  And he said, he said, hey... [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1657.08s)]
*  You said that so naturally. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1661.08s)]
*  What? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1663.08s)]
*  I'm saying that? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1664.08s)]
*  You said that so naturally. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1665.08s)]
*  That's the thing that coaches can find themselves dealing with. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1666.08s)]
*  He trying to get that three-pointer out of you, bro. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1670.08s)]
*  He trying to... [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1673.08s)]
*  But they had... [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1676.08s)]
*  Yeah, it just... [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1677.08s)]
*  But they called him and said, hey... [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1678.08s)]
*  They said, Mr. Sharp, you can't... [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1680.08s)]
*  If you keep tickling the kids, you can't coach them no more. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1682.08s)]
*  But that was it. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1685.08s)]
*  There wasn't a lawsuit or anything. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1686.08s)]
*  It was just more... [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1688.08s)]
*  You know, stern activity. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1690.08s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1691.08s)]
*  Don't do it like that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1693.08s)]
*  But we had... [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1694.08s)]
*  I mean, I don't fucking know, man. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1695.08s)]
*  What were we talking about? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1697.08s)]
*  Oh, swimming people. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1699.08s)]
*  Swimming, man. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1701.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think I just get too nervous in water. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1702.08s)]
*  I just... [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1704.08s)]
*  I know it's too powerful. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1705.08s)]
*  That's what I know. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1706.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1707.08s)]
*  I know it's way more powerful than I am, man. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1708.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1710.08s)]
*  But it's so funny you... [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1711.08s)]
*  Yeah, because I could see you, man. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1713.08s)]
*  I think sometimes if I think about you, I think about you like... [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1715.08s)]
*  I could see you having like a show at a SeaWorld or something like that, you know? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1718.08s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1724.08s)]
*  Like a... [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1725.08s)]
*  The... [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1728.08s)]
*  No. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1729.08s)]
*  It'll be a one night only. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1730.08s)]
*  Because I'm letting everybody out. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1732.08s)]
*  Are you free? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1735.08s)]
*  Like, this is wrong. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1736.08s)]
*  You're free. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1737.08s)]
*  Like, I'm black. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1738.08s)]
*  I'm not going to stand here in front of a prison and do a show. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1739.08s)]
*  You're freeing all the black fish. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1743.08s)]
*  All the fish. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1746.08s)]
*  All the fish. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1747.08s)]
*  Every fish in the ocean, bro. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1748.08s)]
*  Free Nemo, bro, until it's backwards, man. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1750.08s)]
*  I don't know what happened yesterday. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1753.08s)]
*  Everyone's gone. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1755.08s)]
*  Dude, if they had one... [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1756.08s)]
*  If they had one night though... [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1760.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1762.08s)]
*  I'm talking a $5, $320 ticket. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1763.08s)]
*  It's a pricey ticket, but it's a one night only. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1766.08s)]
*  Cat Williams and the whales, baby. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1769.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1772.08s)]
*  Cat, fish. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1773.08s)]
*  I got you. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1775.08s)]
*  People, bro. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1777.08s)]
*  It'd be unprecedented, man. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1778.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1780.08s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1781.08s)]
*  Indeed it would. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1782.08s)]
*  It would be unprecedented. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1783.08s)]
*  People would love it, man. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1784.08s)]
*  I think people are loving the fact that you're sharing new stories. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1786.08s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1791.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1792.08s)]
*  Yeah, like... [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1793.08s)]
*  So get back to the guy in his big bathtub. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1794.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1797.08s)]
*  Roy was his name, right? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1798.08s)]
*  Roy. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1799.08s)]
*  And he ended up in the military. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1800.08s)]
*  But at the time, nobody knew that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1801.08s)]
*  We were just children and he got a whistle or something. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1803.08s)]
*  Somebody bought him a whistle. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1806.08s)]
*  And so he would just have us do these little games or whatever. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1808.08s)]
*  And so I don't know if kids were violent during that [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1814.08s)]
*  or sometimes people would be aggressive or something, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1818.08s)]
*  but I think maybe that made me nervous about water. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1820.08s)]
*  My sister almost drowned one time. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1823.08s)]
*  I thought she did, but she almost drowned once. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1826.08s)]
*  So I think just stuff like that. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1829.08s)]
*  We would go swim in a river and there weren't a lot of lifeguards. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1831.08s)]
*  So I think that's super scary because you get caught with a current or something. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1834.08s)]
*  It's just real. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1839.08s)]
*  It can be a lot, you know? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1841.08s)]
*  Which river? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1843.08s)]
*  The river we were at. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1844.08s)]
*  I think it was probably part of the Chifuncta, like a little tributary of it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1845.08s)]
*  Dirty water? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1849.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1850.08s)]
*  That's scary too. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1851.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1852.08s)]
*  Yeah, so just that kind of atmosphere, I guess, maybe. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1853.08s)]
*  Trying to think what made me so scared. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1857.08s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1858.08s)]
*  I don't know if I knew how to swim that great. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1859.08s)]
*  You know, at Chifuncta River. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1863.08s)]
*  I don't know if I knew how to swim that great, to be honest with you. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1865.08s)]
*  But yeah, I think, yeah, people could. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1870.08s)]
*  I would love to see you do a water show of some sort one day, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1872.08s)]
*  if you ventured out to that sort of thing. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1875.08s)]
*  I appreciate the fact that you're giving me ideas of things that are unprecedented. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1878.08s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be really cool, man. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1884.08s)]
*  Nobody else has a water show. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1885.08s)]
*  I love it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=1890.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2219.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's so surprising, man. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2222.08s)]
*  I had a friend, I was talking to him. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2224.08s)]
*  He said, hey, do you want me to go to your apartment and get your, I got a Jeep Cherokee out of here. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2227.08s)]

*  And I said, I think it's going to be OK. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2235.08s)]
*  And I said, what are you doing? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2238.08s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to an audition. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2239.08s)]
*  And it was just so wild that you had places that were completely disappear off the earth. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2242.08s)]
*  And then you have a guy who's going to an audition at the same time, you know, just that there's so many things happening at once in this. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2248.08s)]
*  It's like part of it is so affected and some of it is unaffected, you know, kind of just was a dikechotomy. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2254.08s)]
*  Yeah, I feel that way every time I watch international news, you know what I mean? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2261.08s)]
*  Just to be watching other countries news and see all of the stuff that they're going through that we never hear about or know about. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2266.08s)]
*  Yes, it's crazy. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2275.08s)]
*  L.A. is just so massive of a city, you know, it's like a state almost in a way. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2278.08s)]
*  Right. Like L.A. is like a collection of 100 cities, you know, that make this. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2283.08s)]
*  That's a good point. I never thought about it like that. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2289.08s)]
*  With Hollywood and it's in Cino and Beverly Hills and all Compton, Gardena and Englewood and Hawthorne and Torrance and the city of Manchester and all of these places are [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2291.08s)]
*  fingers and pieces of the body that is L.A. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2307.08s)]
*  So there's no way for six or seven of those parts to be going through pain and the body to be OK. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2313.08s)]
*  But by the same token, it has to be, you know what I mean? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2325.08s)]
*  Like if you break your finger, the rest of your fingers still got work to do. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2331.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2339.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2344.08s)]
*  Sometimes I think about what it would be like. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2350.08s)]
*  Like if I were like another ethnicity, you know, you ever imagine like that, like if you was an Asian guy? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2354.08s)]
*  Like if you could handle it? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2361.08s)]
*  No, I am. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2364.08s)]
*  You ever had dreams like that where you're Asian? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2367.08s)]
*  I'm not sure if you have those when you're black. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2369.08s)]
*  I'm like. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2372.08s)]
*  I'm saying I was born black, so I was born a superior being, a superb specimen, if you will, as far as human creations are concerned. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2379.08s)]
*  So I never wanted to be anything other than that. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2394.08s)]
*  I wanted to know how other people felt. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2401.08s)]
*  So I didn't. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2408.08s)]
*  But you never like thought I want to be that? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2410.08s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2412.08s)]
*  No. But maybe some of that is because I didn't think that was possible. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2414.08s)]
*  Like, like. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2422.08s)]
*  Yeah, like I didn't I didn't see it from a negative perspective. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2427.08s)]
*  I saw it from a positive perspective. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2433.08s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2438.08s)]
*  Like I'm in the driver's seat. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2439.08s)]
*  I don't. Yeah, it'd be cool to be a passenger, but I'm I like the seat I'm in. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2441.08s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2447.08s)]
*  I didn't think that I didn't think that Chinese people were having more fun or doing better things or I thought they were doing different things. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2448.08s)]
*  And we had are doing fine. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2462.08s)]
*  Yeah. And I was interested in knowing what those were, but it never dawned on me that they might be better. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2463.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2469.08s)]
*  And I had I had white friends that were admirable, but I didn't imagine being white. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2470.08s)]
*  And I didn't think that they imagined being black, I guess, either. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2481.08s)]
*  But you have a great imagination, which is what makes you world class. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2487.08s)]
*  You know, like you have to have that because I heard you tell the story of, you know, I know the stories. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2493.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think because I think about that a lot, I guess, of what it would be like to be different ethnicities if I could handle it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2501.08s)]
*  You know, if I would think it was fun, I don't think that you would be as different from yourself as you are as a white guy as you imagine that you would be. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2510.08s)]
*  Oh, you would just be kind of the same, but just in different shape. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2521.08s)]
*  Right. Right. What I'm saying is I don't I don't think that you you because you think the thoughts and all are kind of the same than you think. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2524.08s)]
*  Like that's I'm almost certain. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2534.08s)]
*  I'm almost certain that you as a black guy are also not the norm. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2536.08s)]
*  You're not. Yeah, you're. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2544.08s)]
*  I could do it. I think I have a singular. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2547.08s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2550.08s)]
*  Okay, I would like, you know, if I ever, I don't know what I'm trying to culture vulture or whatever, but I would like if they ever give you if they do, you know, if they let people if I get to do reincarnation, I would put in an application under that. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2552.08s)]
*  Okay, so let's let's work this out. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2567.08s)]
*  Let's work this out because if reincarnation is real. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2569.08s)]
*  You have some say in it. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2576.08s)]
*  That's right. Because you probably get to apply or talk to the manager. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2579.08s)]
*  I'm saying there's nobody else's opinion that will be more valued than yours. Right. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2582.08s)]
*  So let's decide. So, so where are you coming back? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2587.08s)]
*  What do you want to what do you want to try first? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2593.08s)]

*  Not get ahead of yourself. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2656.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would go easy into it. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2658.08s)]
*  I wouldn't let anybody know that I was had been there that I was. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2660.08s)]
*  It was my first time. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2665.08s)]
*  You know, I think you'd have to be because sometimes I believe you have first times as a human even like you meet some people and it's like, oh, this is this person's first time being a human. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2667.08s)]
*  The soul. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2677.08s)]
*  Like this. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2679.08s)]
*  Right. This is a damn newborn, you know. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2680.08s)]
*  Right. And then you meet some people you're like, damn, this person is a sensei. This person has been they've been here before they've been here before. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2682.08s)]
*  But yeah, I wouldn't go do black first, man. I wouldn't. Yeah, I would definitely keep that for like a or I would. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2689.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would try. I would be I would be honored to do it if they let me do it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2696.08s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2700.08s)]
*  I don't I don't speak for the entire delegation, but. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2701.08s)]
*  And I would do my best. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2707.08s)]
*  We would be that again as a black guy, we would be honored to have you come through apply our path. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2708.08s)]
*  And the only reason I said don't do it first is just because there are certain things that go along with it that you just don't know how you handle it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2718.08s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2728.08s)]
*  Until you got the dick of a horse and then you just got to figure this thing out like. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2729.08s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. You got a parallel park even probably tougher. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2735.08s)]
*  You know, everything is different. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2739.08s)]
*  A little bit different. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2741.08s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, I don't know if I'd go if yeah, I would like to especially if I got to bring a friend, I would definitely do it. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2742.08s)]
*  And I'm talking you don't get to bring a friend who you make new friends with each of the you see I'm saying. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2750.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2757.08s)]
*  See, I want to just have some safety, you know, same reason I'm I don't want to be in the water, you know, it's just when I feel risk, it makes me I think makes me feel nervous, you know. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2759.08s)]
*  Right. But nervousness was created for that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2769.08s)]
*  That's nervousness is a good thing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2773.08s)]
*  You're supposed to feel that. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2776.08s)]
*  But that doesn't dictate whether you continue. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2778.08s)]
*  And if you can get a hold of that understanding that nervousness doesn't mean stop the yellow light doesn't mean stop the yellow light means be cautious. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2783.08s)]
*  Right. And so when you feel those nerves understand those nerves mean okay don't fuck around. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2798.08s)]
*  But you can still enjoy. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2806.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2808.08s)]
*  So we're going to get you closer to the water in 2025, and we're going to deal with some of these ethnic blockages maybe. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2809.08s)]
*  I don't think they're blockages you're very open minded. Yeah, thanks man. Yeah, they're not blockages. Yeah, just you're not dealing with blockage you're dealing with uncertainty as to who you are. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2826.08s)]
*  As to who you are in the universe, and whether or not you belong in the places you feel like you. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2838.08s)]
*  That's interesting. That is kind of how I feel. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2848.08s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm always thinking of what this other thing would be like kind of right. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2853.08s)]
*  Right, because I never thought I never really thought about it like that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2858.08s)]
*  Do you believe this is your home planet. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2863.08s)]
*  You know, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2866.08s)]
*  do you believe that most of the people here that are living right now that this is their home planet. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2869.08s)]
*  No. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2881.08s)]
*  No. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2884.08s)]
*  I think it's more that worse, we you think we're maybe a species from somewhere else that's been kind of that landed here or that got. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2886.08s)]
*  All of the religions tell the same story. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2898.08s)]
*  All of the stories are started up there, and then end up down here, and then continue. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2903.08s)]
*  And there's a reason for that, I believe. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2910.08s)]
*  Do you feel like this is like a place where supposed to learn something do you feel like it's a place that we're kind of just spending time and experience a destination. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2916.08s)]
*  You and I are at an age where we remember when the video game experience wasn't what it is now. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2929.08s)]
*  It was still a game like Monopoly. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2937.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know where it is now. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2941.08s)]
*  It's a whole different universe that you can live inside from your Xbox or your PlayStation and in Call of Duty. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2944.08s)]
*  You're an actual soldier and you get kills and deaths and eliminations. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2956.08s)]
*  When you then cross over to the PGA game, you have your actual golfer that looks like you and has the name you gave him and he's really going to go out there and do this 18 on Whistling Straight. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2965.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2978.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2979.08s)]
*  Then I go and get in my Podium One Sim Racer and pick the car of my choice and I'm an actual racer. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2980.08s)]
*  So those experiences located in that console, that's this experience here on Earth that we're all able to share. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=2994.08s)]
*  That's what would make that reincarnation possible. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3006.08s)]
*  It just means, oh, yesterday I played that game and today I'm logging in this experience. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3010.08s)]
*  Certainly a universal college, if you will. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3019.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3028.08s)]
*  Sometimes I forget I get caught up in the minutia of things and I forget to have this bigger breath of like, this is an experience. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3030.08s)]
*  It's not a sentence. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3040.08s)]
*  An experience in which you're winning. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3041.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3044.08s)]
*  And an experience in which you're in a better position than others who have been in this same, you are excelling in a life in which you very well could have turned out to be nothing. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3045.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3066.08s)]
*  Or another statistic or just another forgotten body in a ditch. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3067.08s)]
*  And those were the hazards. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3074.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3078.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3079.08s)]
*  And you, Diova, made it through all of that and negated all of those horrific possibilities and are here in this position the best you've ever been. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3080.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3092.08s)]
*  And those are the facts. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3093.08s)]
*  And if we tell ourselves more of the facts in our head, then we don't hear so much negative. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3095.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3103.08s)]
*  If we try and just focus on telling ourselves the facts? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3104.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3106.08s)]
*  Of how good we're doing. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3107.08s)]
*  Like, we're much too hard on ourselves. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3109.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3113.08s)]
*  I feel that all the time, man. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3114.08s)]
*  I feel like I don't know any other way to be almost sometimes. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3115.08s)]
*  Like, not in a bad way, but yeah. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3118.08s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's this constant sentence. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3120.08s)]
*  You know, like you've got to... [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3123.08s)]
*  I feel like there's always been this to-do list that I don't even make and it's just always been there. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3125.08s)]
*  Does that make any sense to you? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3129.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3130.08s)]
*  That's how I feel all the time. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3131.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3133.08s)]
*  Like, I've got to do, you know, still have to prove it, you know, a constant of approving. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3134.08s)]
*  This... all winners have that disease. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3139.08s)]
*  It's self-inflicted. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3144.08s)]
*  It's for you. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3149.08s)]
*  It's you doing that. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3153.08s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with that harsh management. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3155.08s)]
*  It's what gets you to the point that you're at. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3159.08s)]
*  But if you have animals, you know that a relationship doesn't do good with just control words, just sit and stay. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3162.08s)]
*  And there needs to be connection fostered. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3178.08s)]
*  And treats are the best thing for learning, you know? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3184.08s)]
*  And so treat yourself with those type of things as well. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3191.08s)]
*  Like, don't forget to remind yourself of all of the people that you tell stories about and the fact that that was it for them. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3197.08s)]
*  That little piece of the story you told, like, they didn't get better. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3211.08s)]
*  Like, they didn't then change some stuff and go like you did. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3216.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3223.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3224.08s)]
*  Do you feel like... who was like a role model when you were growing up? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3226.08s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3370.08s)]
*  Because you gave two whole different sizes for two niggas that's the same size. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3371.08s)]
*  You can see they ain't the same size in the picture. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3378.08s)]
*  He doesn't let that change his story. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3382.08s)]
*  One of them was seven foot seven. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3384.08s)]
*  He was bigger than all the trees. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3386.08s)]
*  The other one was six foot one. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3388.08s)]
*  Here they are together. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3390.08s)]
*  Johnny was so tall, he had windows on the side of his head, but he was tall, man. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3392.08s)]

*  Countless stories. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3399.08s)]
*  That's true. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3400.08s)]
*  You're right. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3402.08s)]
*  I was kneeling down, man. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3406.08s)]
*  But these experiences, no matter what, that dude number 34, we want to hear his stories. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3408.08s)]

*  And the fact that that's what you do is why. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3422.08s)]

*  You do a great job, too, man. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3433.08s)]
*  Thank you for all the joy over the years. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3434.08s)]
*  You just bought a military base, is that right? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3438.08s)]
*  Yeah, formerly Fort McClellan. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3443.08s)]
*  Fort McClellan. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3447.08s)]
*  And was it an active base until recently? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3448.08s)]
*  I think it decommissioned in 1999. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3452.08s)]
*  What's it like over there? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3457.08s)]
*  Magnificent. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3459.08s)]
*  Magnificent. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3461.08s)]
*  It's going to be one of the greatest things that I personally have ever done. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3462.08s)]
*  This is it? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3468.08s)]
*  That's the front side of the beginning of the campus, which is 30 buildings, 3 million indoor square feet, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3470.08s)]
*  4.5 miles of roads. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3485.08s)]
*  We got the best parts of the base. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3489.08s)]
*  They had chemical testing and stuff. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3494.08s)]
*  We don't have those parts of the base. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3497.08s)]
*  That's the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3500.08s)]
*  But yeah, we just have a wonderful, blessed base at the foothills of the mountains. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3502.08s)]
*  It's really magical. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3511.08s)]
*  I was able to see what Tyler Perry was able to do with two or three hundred acres and a military base. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3516.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3526.08s)]
*  And how you could make a movie studio out of that. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3528.08s)]
*  And so yeah, it hit the news recently, but I purchased it a couple years back. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3533.08s)]
*  I've had it, so we've been working. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3548.08s)]
*  Was that a tough step to take that, like, okay, we can get this and we can do this? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3550.08s)]
*  Did you reach out to Tyler Perry? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3557.08s)]
*  Because I know he has, in Atlanta, he has an amazing space. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3558.08s)]
*  He may have many spaces now. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3561.08s)]
*  This was three years ago. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3563.08s)]
*  I went to a space to train for something and they were it was unbelievable. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3564.08s)]
*  No, no, no, I wasn't. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3569.08s)]
*  I wasn't looking then or now for assistance. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3570.08s)]
*  Like we can do this. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3575.08s)]
*  I just needed to be able to have a home where great movies and entertainment product could be made without any of the shenanigans that are generally involved with Hollywood and be able to crank them out and that all it needs to do is be good. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3577.08s)]
*  If it's good, we're going to make it. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3604.08s)]
*  And so even though it might have appeared from interviews of me that, you know, this guy just loves tearing people apart, really, you know, we're trying to create something where they can provide a platform for a lot of people to show what they do. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3607.08s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3628.08s)]
*  So it would be a place where you can make other people's kind of dreams come true, like with film, television, that's right. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3630.08s)]
*  Right. Where you can just basically have a great script and a great cast and leave your troubles at the door and walk out with the movie. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3637.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3651.08s)]
*  In the can, you know, I mean, like, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3652.08s)]
*  I like that. I like that doing things yourself. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3655.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3658.08s)]
*  Yeah, because they'll they'll let the comedy movie industry die if we allow it. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3659.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3668.08s)]
*  And nobody in the fan base ever said, Hey, we don't want any more funny movies. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3669.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3674.08s)]
*  Nobody said that. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3675.08s)]
*  None of the fans ever were like, Hey, we're tired of laughing in the movies. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3676.08s)]
*  No one ever said that. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3682.08s)]
*  They just decided, you know, we make more money in the superhero action department. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3685.08s)]
*  Let's just do all those. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3692.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3694.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3695.08s)]
*  And so it'll just take for somebody in the comedy sphere to start producing funny shit. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3696.08s)]
*  And there we go again. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3705.08s)]
*  Do you already have projects kind of on tap? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3707.08s)]
*  Yeah, we got a slate. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3710.08s)]
*  Well, I'm not allowed to really answer that question. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3712.08s)]
*  But yeah, like, it's a great it's a great location where it is, you know, like it's an hour and a half from Atlanta or less. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3716.08s)]

*  That's kind of it's kind of it's kind of not necessary for how for how it's set up. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3759.08s)]
*  It's set up in much of the way the grocery store is set up. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3770.08s)]
*  So my job is just to make sure that all of the food that we sell in this grocery store belongs in this grocery store. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3775.08s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3785.08s)]

*  Yeah, because comedy don't need a really big budget either. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3814.08s)]
*  It just needs to be funny. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3817.08s)]
*  Yeah, it needs to be funny. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3819.08s)]

*  See, they can't. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3825.08s)]
*  It's got to be professional. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3826.08s)]
*  Yeah, it cannot look cheap regardless, which means it can be, you know, and that goes to the equipment and to the lighting. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=3827.08s)]

*  This was at LAX. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4284.08s)]
*  You bet it was. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4285.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4286.08s)]
*  So she was TSA approved too, you know. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4288.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4291.08s)]
*  So yeah, if I see her again, I would try to... [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4292.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4295.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4296.08s)]
*  We're seeing her again. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4297.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4298.08s)]
*  We're seeing her again because you have this feeling already. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4299.08s)]
*  You're only saying it like, well, you never know. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4303.08s)]
*  I might not see. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4306.08s)]
*  You're going to see her again. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4307.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4309.08s)]
*  Because we, yeah, you're going to ask her out. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4310.08s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4312.08s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4313.08s)]
*  Oh, she might... [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4315.08s)]
*  No, she's not watching. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4317.08s)]
*  She might be watching. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4319.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4320.08s)]
*  She might be watching. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4321.08s)]
*  Do you do that? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4322.08s)]
*  You put things like into... [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4323.08s)]
*  Do you like speak things into existence type of thing? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4324.08s)]
*  I'm not powerful enough to do that, but I don't ignore things that I see in existence. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4330.08s)]
*  So what I'm saying is I'm not going to ignore the fact that you're not saying abstract. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4340.08s)]
*  You know, if I saw a black woman that did something for me, I'd ask her out. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4348.08s)]
*  No, you actively saw one. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4355.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4357.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4358.08s)]
*  And this is recent. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4359.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4360.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4361.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4362.08s)]
*  And it's going to be life changing. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4363.08s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4367.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4368.08s)]
*  Are black women a lot different, do you think? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4369.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4374.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4375.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4376.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4377.08s)]
*  You know black guys, right? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4378.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4381.08s)]
*  Black women are nothing like black guys. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4382.08s)]
*  I don't want to put so much pressure on this lady at the airport, but she doesn't know [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4389.08s)]
*  we've had this conversation. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4397.08s)]
*  No. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4398.08s)]
*  No, she doesn't. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4399.08s)]
*  Magnificent creatures. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4400.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4403.08s)]
*  In slavery, black women were appreciated. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4404.08s)]
*  You understand how difficult that is? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4411.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4414.08s)]
*  That's some hard shit to pull off. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4415.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4418.08s)]
*  I hate you guys, but not all of you. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4419.08s)]
*  Some of you are wonderful. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4425.08s)]
*  Precious beings. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4430.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4432.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4433.08s)]
*  Black women are almost unreal, only because what it is that they possess, they don't ... it's [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4434.08s)]
*  not on purpose. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4448.08s)]
*  You know how we feel about people on the spectrum? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4449.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4452.08s)]
*  They're magic. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4453.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4454.08s)]
*  The reverence that you and I have for that community, right? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4455.08s)]
*  You're going to feel that with black women. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4460.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4464.08s)]
*  They're really where the word nurture comes from. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4465.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4471.08s)]
*  The ability to give you something as a man that you never had before or felt before and [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4474.08s)]
*  make it comfortable for you to access that. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4484.08s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4487.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4488.08s)]
*  Really life changing. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4489.08s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4490.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4491.08s)]
*  This could be part of my 2025, man. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4492.08s)]
*  It is. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4498.08s)]
*  It clearly is. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4499.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4500.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4501.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4502.08s)]
*  We've said it. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4503.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4504.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4505.08s)]
*  Last year, it seemed like you had a lot of predictions last year. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4506.08s)]
*  You kind of became this oracle last year. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4508.08s)]
*  Did you feel that? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4511.08s)]
*  That people came to you, you almost became kind of like this little bit of a crystal [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4514.08s)]
*  ball, you know? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4520.08s)]
*  I'm honored to get to say the things that I say when I'm saying them. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4524.08s)]
*  And because you know that I operate from a positive first standpoint in all things, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4533.08s)]
*  like I assume that it's going to work out for the best. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4543.08s)]
*  And I understand that if it is for the worst, then I'm prepared to handle that as well. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4549.08s)]
*  But yeah, it was something. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4558.08s)]
*  Did you start to worry any about your own safety and stuff? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4564.08s)]
*  Because it seemed like you really had some moments where you're kind of, you know, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4567.08s)]
*  almost channeling truths into the world. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4572.08s)]
*  And some people don't like that. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4584.08s)]
*  You know, some people don't want to. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4586.08s)]
*  I mean, the dark side of things doesn't really probably enjoy that. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4588.08s)]
*  Well, what it was that I was attempting to do was impossible. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4592.08s)]
*  Before I do this interview, there is no Illuminati. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4597.08s)]
*  It's just a joke. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4602.08s)]
*  It's just something that crazy people talk about. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4604.08s)]
*  There's no such thing as our side and God's side. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4607.08s)]
*  None of that is even real. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4611.08s)]
*  I got to come and make it real. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4613.08s)]
*  I have to come and say, no, no, no, no. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4615.08s)]
*  Everybody's not the same. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4619.08s)]
*  So that's why when I said that, nobody came out and went, that's not true. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4622.08s)]
*  I'm on God's side. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4627.08s)]
*  Like, none of them. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4629.08s)]
*  I'm just the conversation was to show that there are spiritual things going on in the world [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4631.08s)]
*  and that there are things that are bigger than just coincidence. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4639.08s)]
*  And that a ritual is something that you do over and over and over again a certain way. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4646.08s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4654.08s)]
*  If part of the ritual is wearing a dress, then we should be able to look through entertainment [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4656.08s)]
*  and see all of these people being made to wear a dress. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4663.08s)]
*  That's what a ritual is. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4668.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4670.08s)]
*  Whether they're white or black, that doesn't matter. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4673.08s)]
*  There's not other jobs where this is a requirement. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4677.08s)]
*  Why is this so necessary? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4681.08s)]
*  Yeah, you don't see the dog catcher show up every other year. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4686.08s)]
*  I guess not. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4691.08s)]
*  In a nice skirt or you don't see an electrician come up in a blouse every now and then. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4693.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4699.08s)]
*  I'm saying a lot of people that doubt what you say don't read and they haven't been readers. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4700.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4707.08s)]
*  Books were my life, literally. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4709.08s)]
*  I thought that I could learn enough information to be an important person. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4711.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4719.08s)]
*  I'm actively trying to eat information. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4721.08s)]
*  Do you have a favorite book? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4729.08s)]
*  No. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4733.08s)]
*  Even when I said how many books I read, people are thinking maybe I'm reading 150, 200-page books. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4735.08s)]
*  I'm reading as many of them as I can because I'm trying to earn these pizza parties and these other weekly reader things that exist. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=4748.08s)]

*  You think there's ever ways where we can get to the control room and see who's controlling [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5317.08s)]
*  it, or you think that's all? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5321.08s)]
*  We're past that. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5325.08s)]
*  We're past that. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5328.08s)]
*  But we don't protect the whistleblower, right? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5330.08s)]
*  We don't honor the scout that would tell us who it is. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5348.08s)]
*  Matter of fact, when they get him, we're going to go, oh, I could have told you that was [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5357.08s)]
*  going to happen. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5361.08s)]
*  They're telling too much truth. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5362.08s)]
*  Do you think Hollywood has a lot of things that they like hold against people, you know? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5363.08s)]
*  Like, I had a theory that a lot of this is human nature. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5367.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5371.08s)]
*  So it's not even Hollywood, it's just human nature. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5372.08s)]
*  It starts as human nature. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5373.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5375.08s)]
*  So I'm saying these things that I'm saying in Hollywood exist in religion circles, in [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5376.08s)]
*  politics, in the medical profession. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5386.08s)]
*  In any circle of business, really. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5393.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5396.08s)]
*  They had a big boss with Puff Daddy where he got arrested. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5399.08s)]
*  And then they've had like accusations and stuff. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5403.08s)]
*  He hasn't gone on trial, I don't think yet. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5406.08s)]
*  But do you think that they, there's been speculation that they did that because they, the timing [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5408.08s)]
*  of that was they wanted to like use other people that have allegedly been involved in [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5415.08s)]
*  some of his circles to, they wanted to kind of use like, okay, you could be next unless [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5423.08s)]
*  you help this political plan. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5431.08s)]
*  Do you think that's at all possible? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5436.08s)]
*  That's how all cases are handled. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5437.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5440.08s)]
*  So what am I saying? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5442.08s)]
*  I'm saying if it's car theft and we're going to accuse you of having a carjacking ring, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5443.08s)]
*  right? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5451.08s)]
*  We're going to begin by bringing in people that we caught who were robbing cars, who [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5453.08s)]
*  said that you was the boss, they're first in line. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5462.08s)]
*  And then we're going to bring in victims, the people whose cars you stole and said, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5466.08s)]
*  yeah, that was him. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5471.08s)]
*  That's how they build a case. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5473.08s)]
*  So none of that should be shocking. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5476.08s)]
*  You don't put it past them? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5483.08s)]
*  It's part of what an investigation is. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5485.08s)]
*  But do you feel like they would say to someone, okay, we're going to bring you in unless? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5490.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5496.08s)]
*  That's what they did. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5497.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5498.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5499.08s)]
*  Even like in the rap world, like all of the rappers that you know that never been to jail [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5500.08s)]
*  and never gotten any trouble with the law, but they talk as if their life is opposite [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5505.08s)]
*  of that. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5516.08s)]
*  Like those are federal informants. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5517.08s)]
*  You think they're really out there? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5519.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5522.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5523.08s)]
*  That's part of the job is to acquire those. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5524.08s)]
*  It's like saying, you know, if you're playing chess, do you have any pawns? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5530.08s)]
*  You have to, don't you? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5536.08s)]
*  You can't start without them. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5538.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5540.08s)]

*  Yeah, it kind of makes it exciting too when you think about it. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5556.08s)]
*  It can be exciting and depressing. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5559.08s)]
*  Did you ever do a rap album? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5565.08s)]

*  You did pretty good. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5819.08s)]
*  Thank you, bro. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5820.08s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5821.08s)]
*  They would be proud. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5822.08s)]
*  They were good, bro. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5823.08s)]
*  They were. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5824.08s)]
*  They were good. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5825.08s)]
*  But that was a great time for music of all genres. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5826.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5828.08s)]
*  Good music was just good music. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5830.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5832.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5833.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5834.08s)]
*  I remember one of them, I'm trying to think of one of the firsts. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5835.08s)]
*  Oh, I went to a Shy. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5837.08s)]
*  Green day. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5838.08s)]
*  You're going to make a great black guy. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5839.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5841.08s)]
*  And they had Tevin Campbell. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5842.08s)]
*  Remember him? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5843.08s)]
*  Can we talk for a minute? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5844.08s)]
*  Tevin Campbell. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5848.08s)]
*  Girl, I want to know your name. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5850.08s)]
*  I'm like, fuck it, just go talk to her then. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5855.08s)]
*  No, like tell the truth. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5858.08s)]
*  When we saw him and we heard the song, we were like, are you sure you want to talk to her? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5861.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5867.08s)]
*  No wonder you're so trepidacious. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5868.08s)]
*  That's true. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5872.08s)]
*  That's true. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5877.08s)]
*  That's true. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5880.08s)]
*  That's true. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5881.08s)]
*  He really had a different. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5882.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5885.08s)]
*  The sequel to that song was a surprise. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5886.08s)]
*  We'll just say like that, man, the sequel was a surprise. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5888.08s)]
*  Good time though. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5893.08s)]
*  That was a good time. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5895.08s)]
*  It was a good time. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5896.08s)]
*  When was that? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5897.08s)]
*  That was late 90s, I think. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5899.08s)]
*  Did you ever get to meet Michael Jackson before? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5901.08s)]
*  No, I got to meet Prince. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5906.08s)]
*  You did? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5907.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5908.08s)]
*  Did you ever get to go bike riding with him or anything like that? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5909.08s)]
*  Who's that? [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5911.08s)]
*  Prince. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5912.08s)]
*  I think bike riding may have been the only thing we'd. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5913.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5920.08s)]
*  He wasn't doing bike riding. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5922.08s)]
*  He had had an experience. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5925.08s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5929.08s)]
*  So when I meet him, I'm 12. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5930.08s)]
*  I guess he's 18, 19. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5932.08s)]
*  Oh, you met him when you were 12? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5934.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5937.08s)]
*  I knew him my whole, I'm saying from 12 till he left. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5938.08s)]
*  I knew him the whole time. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5945.08s)]
*  Yeah, he was a magnificent, one of a kind individual. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5949.08s)]
*  I got to... [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5954.08s)]
*  He lived different lives. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5958.08s)]
*  He wasn't where we are when we're talking about how we need to reinvent. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5965.08s)]
*  He was the master at that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5972.08s)]
*  He was only going to be this version of himself for a very short amount of time [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5977.08s)]
*  until he had mastered it and then he was going to go to something else. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5985.08s)]
*  He always had that energy, huh? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5990.08s)]
*  Yeah, from the... [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5993.08s)]
*  Yeah, but when I met him, he was already a millionaire. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=5996.08s)]
*  And so I couldn't initially understand what kept driving him. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6001.08s)]
*  Because it just seemed to me like he was never happy. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6008.08s)]
*  Because every time I would see him, he had achieved 30 new things [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6012.08s)]
*  and had purchased like a hundred new things. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6019.08s)]
*  And still yet he was working like he didn't. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6023.08s)]
*  And I probably was just not understanding what work ethic was. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6029.08s)]
*  But yeah, I learned a lot from that guy. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6036.08s)]
*  I met Shaq when I was 16. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6039.08s)]
*  Damn, where at you think? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6043.08s)]
*  Nowhere. In Orlando, his rookie year. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6045.08s)]
*  Yeah, because he played at LSU, man. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6049.08s)]
*  Yeah, great guy. Great guy. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6052.08s)]
*  Be Shaq. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6055.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6056.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6057.08s)]
*  Dude, if I was that big, I couldn't get my big ass out of bed at that size, man. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6061.08s)]
*  It'd be so hard. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6066.08s)]
*  Because some of it's kind of harder to even a regular size to get up. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6067.08s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6070.08s)]
*  You know how hard it is to get a big old, look at it right there. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6072.08s)]
*  It's so hard to get up when you big. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6076.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6079.08s)]
*  I watch my aunt get up sometimes like she ain't going to get up. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6080.08s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6085.08s)]
*  You ever see somebody, and you're like, she ain't going to get up. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6086.08s)]
*  That's when... [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6090.08s)]
*  And they figure it out. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6092.08s)]
*  When all of the places were catching on fire, that was my first thought was like [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6093.08s)]
*  nobody on my 600 pound life is going to make it out of none of this. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6101.08s)]
*  Like what? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6108.08s)]
*  Yeah, that show's over, bro. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6111.08s)]
*  Like there's a whole portion of the population that can't get up. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6113.08s)]
*  Like everybody's like, evacuate. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6119.08s)]
*  Somebody just shit in the bed. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6123.08s)]
*  I did. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6126.08s)]
*  I did evacuate. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6128.08s)]
*  They evacuated, they just looked the other way. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6132.08s)]
*  That's their evacuating. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6134.08s)]
*  Just lean away from the warm. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6138.08s)]
*  Flip the pillow. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6145.08s)]
*  Did you... [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6148.08s)]
*  What did you and Prince do? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6150.08s)]
*  Did you all go out to eat or nothing? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6151.08s)]
*  Like what did he like to do? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6152.08s)]
*  Because he's just... [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6154.08s)]
*  No, so like... [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6155.08s)]
*  You know how some people have chefs? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6159.08s)]
*  Like he was beyond that. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6162.08s)]
*  Like he wanted a chef to know what he was preparing. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6165.08s)]
*  Like I don't know how to explain it, but like he wasn't vegan the whole time I knew him. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6177.08s)]
*  You know, he was just vegan for this portion. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6185.08s)]
*  But before that, he had a whole different thing. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6189.08s)]
*  But he would have an Italian chef to make Italian when that's what he was having. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6193.08s)]
*  And he like to the extreme. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6199.08s)]
*  He was extreme. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6204.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6205.08s)]
*  So you would get the most beautiful meals around this dude because he was a foodie. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6206.08s)]
*  Oh damn. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6214.08s)]
*  I'd love to watch him eat a little snack or something. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6216.08s)]
*  A little creme brulee or a little big scoop ice cream. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6221.08s)]
*  I'd love to see that. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6225.08s)]
*  Because he was kind of smaller, wasn't he? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6226.08s)]
*  I'm 5'5", so it never really factored in. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6230.08s)]
*  Oh, you're bigger than him, I think. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6235.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6237.08s)]
*  But I'm saying I wasn't gazing at him while he was eating. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6238.08s)]
*  Yeah, we always had enough women around for... [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6243.08s)]
*  I wasn't there in a longing fashion. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6249.08s)]
*  Sorry, watch a small person, if they get up against a real hard scoop ice cream, they fucking can't handle that bitch. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6257.08s)]
*  No, no. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6265.08s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6268.08s)]
*  Rewind that again. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6270.08s)]
*  Somehow I missed that and I can't accept it. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6273.08s)]
*  No, I just sometimes if somebody... [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6276.08s)]
*  I know if I get up, if it's a real cold scoop ice cream and it's hard to get with a spoon or something, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6278.08s)]
*  I'm imagining like a smaller guy battling that bitch. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6284.08s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6289.08s)]
*  I wanted you to acknowledge how funny that was. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6296.08s)]
*  I just wanted to envision in my head, Prince, just got two or three spoons going on that bit, he gonna get in there. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6300.08s)]
*  He'd have whooped your ass in here. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6307.08s)]
*  He probably would have, and blessings, man. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6309.08s)]
*  I had to pull him off. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6311.08s)]
*  Man, he's a purple superhero and he is the king, man. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6314.08s)]
*  In real life, yeah. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6317.08s)]
*  I'm just joking, Prince, if your spirit is here, I'm sure it is somewhere. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6321.08s)]
*  It is indeed, yeah, and he had a great sense of humor. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6324.08s)]
*  Oh, I saw him stop in. I was in Minneapolis. They used to have this place called... [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6327.08s)]
*  And he got more pussy than you. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6333.08s)]
*  Did he? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6335.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, of course he did. What the fuck am I talking about? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6337.08s)]
*  It took me half a second to realize that. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6339.08s)]
*  Of course he did. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6341.08s)]
*  Damn, boy. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6344.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, no, they had a place, though, that he would go perform sometimes on a certain night. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6347.08s)]
*  It was in Minneapolis, and a lot of musicians would just show up. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6351.08s)]
*  And one night he showed up there, man, and it was amazing. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6354.08s)]
*  It was just random people would get together and play. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6357.08s)]
*  No, he loved that probably more than anything else. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6360.08s)]
*  He loved that more than touring. He loved that more than anything is jam sessions. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6365.08s)]
*  And he had places all over the globe, and he was welcomed. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6373.08s)]
*  I'm saying, you're talking about a guy that played 26 instruments. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6381.08s)]
*  Do you feel what I'm saying? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6384.08s)]
*  We're talking about a guy that... [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6386.08s)]
*  Just magical, huh? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6395.08s)]
*  If you could learn from what he did, then you just passed learning. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6397.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? The shit resonates regardless of what it is you're trying to do. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6404.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6410.08s)]
*  And so, yeah, I was blessed to... [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6411.08s)]
*  Even be around him, huh? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6414.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, just to be able to witness a short, young, black guy navigate the highest echelons of entertainment [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6416.08s)]
*  and still be holding on to things that he doesn't do and won't do [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6435.08s)]
*  and still feeling like he needs to look out for other musicians and other artists [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6444.08s)]
*  and still trying not to bring shame on his fans or other black people or music lovers or just a wonderful human. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6452.08s)]
*  That's what you can learn. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6472.08s)]
*  Shit, now I feel bad about making that joke, but I feel okay still. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6475.08s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6478.08s)]
*  It's okay. I'm just joking. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6479.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6481.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6483.08s)]
*  But did... [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6485.08s)]
*  When you were growing up, did you ever have a TV father kind of? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6488.08s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of influences that you had when you were young. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6493.08s)]
*  I had Little House on the Prairie was a show I would watch that they had Michael Landon was on it. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6498.08s)]
*  And then they had In the Heat of the Night. I really liked that show. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6503.08s)]
*  Now, wait a minute. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6509.08s)]
*  Who was the father figure on In the Heat of the Night? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6512.08s)]
*  Was the black guy your father figure? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6516.08s)]
*  Virgil Tibbs. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6519.08s)]
*  Virgil Tibbs. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6521.08s)]
*  Yeah, probably. He was good. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6522.08s)]
*  I will tell you this. I met his wife at a... [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6524.08s)]
*  Or not his wife, but... [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6527.08s)]
*  The lady that played it? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6528.08s)]
*  Yes, that's her right there. Virgil and Sophia was his wife in the show, I think. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6529.08s)]
*  She was way smaller than you thought, right? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6533.08s)]
*  She was very beautiful. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6536.08s)]
*  And I saw her at a breakfast place and I was like, I cannot go back in there and tell her. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6538.08s)]
*  And I did. And it was... I think she kind of appreciated it, but it was still pretty awkward, I think. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6542.08s)]
*  But she's very beautiful. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6547.08s)]
*  But yeah, like Tim May and Carol O'Connor was in it. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6549.08s)]
*  But in the heat of the night. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6552.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6556.08s)]
*  That shit was good. I loved that. What else did I like? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6557.08s)]
*  I'm trying to think of a show where I had like a TV dad. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6560.08s)]
*  Did you have a TV family or someone that you kind of liked? [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6563.08s)]
*  As a black man, I had a real father. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6567.08s)]
*  So I wasn't looking at TV for the images of a real good black father, because I had one. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6573.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6584.08s)]
*  So for me, it was a little interesting just to see how other fathers were portrayed. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6585.08s)]
*  I more enjoyed seeing the dynamics of other families and how things went for them. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6600.08s)]
*  Because that's the only way that I knew, oh, I don't have that type of upbringing at all. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6611.08s)]
*  Wow, that's... Yeah. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6618.08s)]
*  I didn't even know my mother was supposed to love me. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6621.08s)]
*  Like, I didn't know that was... [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6627.08s)]
*  Sorry to laugh, man. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6630.08s)]
*  She never kissed me in my life. I didn't know she was supposed to like me. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6632.08s)]
*  She made sure I ate. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6638.08s)]
*  I had clean clothes. But I'm saying I didn't... [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6644.08s)]
*  It would have been shocking if my mom was always working. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6649.08s)]
*  I would be like, mom, tell me you love me. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6653.08s)]
*  She'd be like, I got to move this box over here. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6655.08s)]
*  I'm like, mom, how do you feel about me? [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6661.08s)]
*  She's like, oh, we got to put all these boxes away. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6663.08s)]
*  She always had something to do. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6665.08s)]
*  Like if a feeling came up, my mom just couldn't have it. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6667.08s)]
*  I love you, mom. It's funny. Now it's funny. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6670.08s)]
*  Right. But now you can... [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6675.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was ridiculous. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6678.08s)]
*  I was like, mom, how do you feel about me? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6682.08s)]
*  She's like, we got to get this car to start. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6684.08s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6686.08s)]
*  Play as the vacuum. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6688.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6693.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6696.08s)]
*  That's what I think... [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6697.08s)]
*  That's what I always was looking for for me. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6699.08s)]
*  But these are the things that guarantee success. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6701.08s)]
*  That's what I'm telling you. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6703.08s)]
*  It's part of what's on that list that you've got certain things against you. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6705.08s)]
*  You're going to be successful. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6715.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6717.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6718.08s)]
*  You're going to be in a position where you can rectify things. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6720.08s)]
*  You know that you're way more appreciative of love because of that. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6727.08s)]
*  You're in a position where you can still be loved by the black lady at the airport. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6738.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6746.08s)]
*  2025. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6747.08s)]
*  My little layover lady. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6748.08s)]
*  That's what I'm calling my little layover. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6751.08s)]
*  I've seen... This is something that I thought... [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6754.08s)]
*  There's only two things that I think that I've seen and I'm not sure. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6758.08s)]
*  One of them was that Santa Claus, when I was a kid, that they brought us outside [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6760.08s)]
*  and they had a real sleigh go by in the air. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6764.08s)]
*  It was an airplane that they disguised as a sleigh in our town. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6766.08s)]
*  The second one is... I thought I saw you riding bikes down Sunset Boulevard. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6769.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6774.08s)]
*  So now, the funniest part of all of that... [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6775.08s)]
*  A true story. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6778.08s)]
*  ...is because all of your stories are true. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6779.08s)]
*  Right? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6782.08s)]
*  But the whole thing is, when you're telling this story, we ride by on these bikes with lights on them. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6783.08s)]
*  Yeah, like from the future. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6793.08s)]
*  Like circus members. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6794.08s)]
*  Really? Really? This is a million and a half dollars worth of Can-Am spiders. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6796.08s)]
*  Eight of them. 200,000 apiece. Me and Shug going down Sunset. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6803.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, I didn't see those, man. I'm sorry. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6813.08s)]
*  I saw some bitches. Somebody covered them bitches. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6817.08s)]
*  Cat Williams came by with a Shetland pony. It had neon lights on the hooves. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6821.08s)]
*  Somebody spray painted silly string on the back of it. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6828.08s)]
*  With a violin. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6831.08s)]
*  Stop playing it. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6833.08s)]
*  Do you believe in life? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6835.08s)]
*  Yeah, I swear to God, I'm standing on the porch. I look over there. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6838.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6842.08s)]
*  And you had done one of those things where you stand up, but keep... you know what I'm saying? [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6843.08s)]
*  When you're riding down the street. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6847.08s)]
*  I'm 5'5", so I do that better than most. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6849.08s)]
*  And I said, damn, there he goes, bro. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6854.08s)]
*  And by the time I get anybody's attention, nobody believed me. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6857.08s)]
*  So that's why I think it had a lot of that same, like when you saw Santa, you know, type of energy. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6860.08s)]
*  Well, understand, I didn't take away from the myth. I just clarified. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6866.08s)]
*  Yeah. No, good. Because I thought I was crazy for thinking that. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6869.08s)]
*  What do you see happening in 2025, Kat? This is where we get to where, like... [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6875.08s)]
*  What do you feel like? What do you feel like are things we can look forward to? Things we can stay conscious of? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6882.08s)]
*  Can I bum another cigarette by chance, man? You got a nice charron? [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6890.08s)]
*  Absolutely. Let's do it. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6893.08s)]
*  Yeah, so... [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6895.08s)]
*  Let me get that, bitch. Get my lungs up. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6896.08s)]
*  We're already in 2025, aren't we? [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6898.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6901.08s)]
*  Yeah. So... [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6902.08s)]
*  So you right already. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6903.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6905.08s)]
*  See there? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6906.08s)]
*  So the whole thing is we're not... [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6907.08s)]
*  This thing does not happen in yearly cycles. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6911.08s)]
*  Like, it's not an every 12 months thing. That's not how it works. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6916.08s)]
*  So the age of truth is not one year. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6921.08s)]
*  It's the beginning of people having more of a thirst for what is true than an appetite for lies. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6927.08s)]
*  So if you sell lies, it's a harder road for you. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6942.08s)]
*  If you have truths to tell, people are hungry for that, and they'll pay you handsomely to hear the truth. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6947.08s)]
*  It wasn't always that way. It's that way right now in real time. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6955.08s)]
*  Whatever that means to you, that's the battle that's going on. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6960.08s)]
*  It's people who profit from the manipulation of others by getting you to believe something that's not the case. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6965.08s)]
*  And that's how they make their living. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6975.08s)]
*  And it is now a difficult time for those entities. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6978.08s)]
*  Do you think that there is actual cloning going on? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6985.08s)]
*  We know that there's actual cloning going on. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6991.08s)]
*  The question I believe you're asking is human cloning. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=6997.08s)]
*  Oh, yes, sir. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7002.08s)]
*  But let's start with the real question. The real question is, is cloning going on? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7003.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7009.08s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7010.08s)]
*  I knew it. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7011.08s)]
*  Well, I'm saying let's just say animal cloning. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7012.08s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7016.08s)]
*  Let's start there. That's not a myth or... [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7017.08s)]
*  No, that's been... [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7021.08s)]
*  That's not a conspiracy theory that we are at the point where we have no problem cloning animals. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7022.08s)]
*  If you lose a pet, you can send away to these companies and they will... [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7030.08s)]
*  They'll fucking remix that bitch and send it back. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7036.08s)]
*  Right. As close a proximity as you can imagine. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7039.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7043.08s)]
*  That we know is possible. Okay. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7044.08s)]
*  So now... [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7047.08s)]
*  You're viagen pets right there. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7049.08s)]
*  So that's in the animal world. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7051.08s)]
*  So now in the human world, we know that there are multiple surgeries that we know we can replace this with that. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7055.08s)]
*  Yeah. All the way up to... [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7068.08s)]
*  What's our last achievement? Is it heart? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7072.08s)]
*  The guy passed away with a pig heart. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7077.08s)]
*  But it worked for... I'm saying... [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7082.08s)]
*  Let me see that. Bring up that pig hearted guy. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7084.08s)]
*  Right there. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7088.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7089.08s)]
*  Two people have received a... [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7090.08s)]
*  A genetically modified pig heart transplant. David Bennett and Lawrence Fauset. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7093.08s)]
*  Both were performed in Maryland. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7099.08s)]
*  So there's not... [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7106.08s)]
*  The evidence is there. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7112.08s)]
*  Very much left on what it would take as far as abilities go. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7114.08s)]
*  Do you think there's any artists now that you think are not the same artists that we thought they were? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7121.08s)]
*  If we're only speaking of biology, I've heard that... [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7129.08s)]
*  A man's G-spot is in his anal passage, which means I'm going to go my whole life without ever experiencing it. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7136.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7148.08s)]
*  By the same token, everybody is a reflection of what they got to go through to get to where they at. Right? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7151.08s)]
*  And I just know that the people that have been in positions where they decided to do some stuff that they said they weren't going to do, they don't be the same on the other side. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7162.08s)]
*  Nothing they can do can make them seem like what you remember them as. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7181.08s)]
*  Have you ever called it spiritual? Because I don't know what else to call it. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7190.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7194.08s)]
*  Have you ever faced that in your own life where people try to come at you for offers like that? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7195.08s)]
*  Do you think that stars get offered that kind of thing? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7204.08s)]
*  Like to compromise themselves sexually for entertainment? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7209.08s)]
*  Again, the things that we are discussing exist in each of the fields. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7216.08s)]
*  Right. Any field. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7224.08s)]
*  Right. Right. Not entertainment exclusively. Politics, religion, science, everywhere. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7226.08s)]
*  Some of this is human nature. Right. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7237.08s)]
*  Because we listen and we don't judge. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7241.08s)]
*  Were there things that you didn't take in your career that you feel like were, like are there things to look out for, do you feel like? [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7251.08s)]
*  There wasn't for me because I knew I wasn't going to take it, but I did want to get offered. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7261.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7266.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? And most of the stuff I wouldn't have believed until I had to get to a certain level to get to see the proof. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7267.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? So I was as shocked as anybody about how powerful Harvey Weinstein was at the time that I was meeting with him [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7275.08s)]
*  and how he could not be told no. That he get whatever he want. You follow what I'm saying? [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7288.08s)]
*  That they'll figure out some way. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7303.08s)]
*  Right. So I thought that didn't apply to me because I don't care about nothing but business and good business. Right. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7305.08s)]
*  And then he offered me two actresses like they was playing cards and I was like, what? [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7314.08s)]
*  Like he just jelted a head like. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7322.08s)]
*  He was like, I know you. Right. Like what? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7324.08s)]
*  Some aces. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7331.08s)]
*  No, my personal aces. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7335.08s)]
*  Yeah. Did you think about it? [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7337.08s)]
*  Look, I'm not in these scary situations. I don't even leave it up to me. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7340.08s)]
*  Like I'm going to do what the superhero would do in this part of the movie regardless and deal with what happens after. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7347.08s)]
*  Yeah. Just because it's a story and I know it's a story. Right. It's my story. You know what I mean? So I can't. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7360.08s)]
*  That's a good way to think about things in general. Yeah. What would the superhero do right now? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7367.08s)]
*  Yeah. Because I'm saying I read about Jesus getting to the mountaintop and the devil saying you can have all of this and him saying you don't have anything to offer me. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7372.08s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? So that's what I got to look up to. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7389.08s)]
*  So I'm going to follow suit in the best version I can regardless of anything else. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7392.08s)]
*  Do you have a comedian that passed away that you really like that you miss a lot? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7405.08s)]
*  I mean, I know there's been a lot of them. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7409.08s)]
*  But did you have a little? I'm scared to say I miss so many. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7413.08s)]
*  Did you have a brother in comedy? I miss so many. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7417.08s)]
*  What was Bernie Mac like? Was he a super guy? Because I've never seen anybody like him. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7422.08s)]
*  That's a great place to start. No. You never saw anybody like him just because there wasn't anybody like him. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7429.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like the things people pretend to do and talk themselves up to be. And he was that already. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7438.08s)]
*  Already. Yeah, I am. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7452.08s)]
*  I went down to his show when he was taping and they were saying he wasn't feeling good. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7461.08s)]
*  I left there feeling like they're murdering this dude. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7468.08s)]
*  He had a lung problem, right? And the doctors told him that he just had to take time away from the show. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7475.08s)]
*  And he could come back when he was okay. And his contract wouldn't let him. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7485.08s)]
*  And they made him work through like... [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7492.08s)]
*  But I miss all of the comedy angels that I came in contact with from Charlie Murphy to Heavy D. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7499.08s)]
*  I miss Heavy D, John Witherspoon. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7514.08s)]
*  We lost some really great comics. I miss Reynaldo Ray. I miss... Yeah, it's been a lot. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7518.08s)]
*  Bring up a picture of Reynaldo Ray. I'm just not familiar with him. Just so I can see what he looks like. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7530.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. Didn't he play in the Cosby show? Was he the grandfather? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7534.08s)]
*  He was a brilliant, brilliant individual. He had multiple master's degrees and was an art collector and a real legendary guy. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7544.08s)]
*  Reynaldo. Yeah. What about Bill Cosby? Did you ever get to meet him or not? [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7564.08s)]
*  Before he had all the problems? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7572.08s)]
*  Is being a r***ist one of the problems? [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7580.08s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7584.08s)]
*  You said it like, before he got scurvy? [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7586.08s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7591.08s)]
*  Sorry, bro. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7593.08s)]
*  That was... Yeah, that was... Yeah, I did... But yeah, what was he like before that? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7601.08s)]
*  Right. Right. I don't know. I don't know. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7609.08s)]
*  He... [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7615.08s)]
*  Comedically, like he has some works comedically that you could put up there in the pantheon of joke telling. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7619.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. He had so many albums when I was a kid that like our parents would play in the car, stuff like that. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7629.08s)]
*  Right. And he spent a good portion of his televised career really making black men and black families look really good in a time when that was not a popular thing to do. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7634.08s)]
*  None of that supersedes r***ist. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7656.08s)]
*  No. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7659.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was glad to not be a fan of his just because, you know, we liked Richard Pryor and you had to kind of like, which way are you? Are you Richard Pryor, Red Fox, or are you Bill Cosby? [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7660.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7678.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7680.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's definitely different than... What else is going on? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7681.08s)]
*  Please don't have an R. Kelly question next time. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7687.08s)]
*  I do not have an R. Kelly question. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7689.08s)]
*  No. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7691.08s)]
*  No, I don't. Did you ever... Did you get to go to Bernie Mac's funeral? Did he have a big funeral? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7693.08s)]
*  Steve Harvey was at his funeral, so I wouldn't have been there anyway. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7703.08s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7708.08s)]
*  What else? [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7718.08s)]
*  I'll be able to tell you when you're black. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7719.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7722.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7723.08s)]
*  I feel like I'm not doing that good right now on it. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7724.08s)]
*  You're doing great. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7726.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7727.08s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7728.08s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7729.08s)]
*  Did you get... Was it scary for you to be a parent whenever you decided you wanted to be a parent? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7731.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's one of those things where... [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7737.08s)]
*  Just only looking back that you realize, oh, I was not in any way qualified for that job. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7745.08s)]
*  But you try so hard, and it means everything. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7754.08s)]
*  But yeah, it's exciting and scary. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7760.08s)]
*  You can't... So you don't have any kids. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7771.08s)]
*  No. I would like to have some children, but I just... [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7779.08s)]
*  Well, if you have one child, you're not going to have the drug issue to deal with ever again. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7782.08s)]
*  Really? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7795.08s)]
*  Yeah, because it's going to... You can't do them both. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7796.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7803.08s)]
*  You can't do them both. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7807.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7809.08s)]
*  And if you... [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7810.08s)]
*  As soon as you have... And it doesn't matter how you get this child. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7811.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7816.08s)]
*  The second you become a father and this life is dependent upon you, you're going to devote everything to that. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7817.08s)]
*  And you're going to have to. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7829.08s)]
*  You're going to have to, because only somebody with your experiences will be able to deal with not being able to sleep for like two months. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7832.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7842.08s)]
*  Just on this baby's schedule that has no schedule except... Yeah, it's crazy. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7843.08s)]
*  Life changing doesn't even say the half of it. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7854.08s)]
*  But you have pets. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7859.08s)]
*  See, this is the thing. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7862.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7864.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7865.08s)]
*  I'm going to get started too. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7866.08s)]
*  This is what's keeping you able to be in this world is because you've not given yourself a life responsibility. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7867.08s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7876.08s)]
*  I agree. I think that's why I became a community, because I didn't want any responsibilities really. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7877.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7880.08s)]
*  In a lot of ways. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7881.08s)]
*  I think there's a big part of me that starts to feel like, yeah, I'm missing out if I don't. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7883.08s)]
*  I'm probably missing out, but I just want to know. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7887.08s)]
*  I want to have every experience I can. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7889.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7891.08s)]
*  And you can. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7892.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7894.08s)]
*  And this is the vehicle for that. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7895.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7897.08s)]
*  That's what a coincidence that all your life will line up for you to want to do that. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7898.08s)]
*  And then to meet a girl at the airport that already loves to fly and travel. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7905.08s)]
*  And make sure I don't have any illegal substances on me too at the same time. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7914.08s)]
*  Just because you're not going to need them. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7919.08s)]
*  Are you a pet owner? Are you a big pet owner, man? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7922.08s)]
*  I've heard that you've got some animals over there. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7926.08s)]
*  Yeah, I love the animals. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7928.08s)]
*  I've heard you've got a couple horses, things like that. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7930.08s)]
*  They're great. Yeah. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7932.08s)]
*  Ducks. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7934.08s)]
*  How many ducks do you have, cat? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7935.08s)]
*  Between 19 and 21. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7941.08s)]
*  I just say that because a couple were there when I first got the place and they never left. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7944.08s)]
*  Right? So they're there. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7952.08s)]
*  But everybody else we raise some eggs, you know, that you go down to. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7954.08s)]
*  What's the name of that place? [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7958.08s)]
*  Tractor Supply. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7960.08s)]
*  Oh, Tractor Supply. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7962.08s)]
*  Yeah. You go to Tractor Supply. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7963.08s)]
*  Oh, in the feed-in-seat shop? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7966.08s)]
*  Right. You do the incubators. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7968.08s)]
*  So yeah, it's beautiful because they're all black. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7970.08s)]
*  Oh, really? Good. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7974.08s)]
*  We need more of that. We need everybody. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7976.08s)]
*  Diversity in the duck world. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7978.08s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, dog. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7980.08s)]
*  I'm sick of seeing these fucking swans, bro. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7982.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7984.08s)]
*  These rich ass long neck motherfuckers, bro. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7986.08s)]
*  No, we have geese too. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7990.08s)]
*  But I'm just saying we need some fucking bangers in there, dog. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7992.08s)]
*  You know, we need some dark ducks in this bitch. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7995.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7997.08s)]
*  Bring up a couple of black ducks, man. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=7999.08s)]
*  I would love to see those right now because I'm used to seeing mallards I've seen for sure. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8001.08s)]
*  But I've never seen some really good darker ducks. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8006.08s)]
*  So that's a beautiful one right there. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8009.08s)]
*  None of these are black ducks. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8011.08s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8013.08s)]
*  But no, get one of them. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8015.08s)]
*  There we go. That western black duck. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8017.08s)]
*  That western black. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8019.08s)]
*  That's an all black duck. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8021.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8023.08s)]
*  Oh, that's fucking mallard Luther King right there, bro. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8025.08s)]
*  That thing is dark as hell, dude. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8029.08s)]
*  Sorry, bro. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8035.08s)]
*  You know, make a great black guy. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8037.08s)]
*  Mallard Luther King. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8039.08s)]
*  That could be his name. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8041.08s)]
*  And that is actually a beautiful name for a duck. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8043.08s)]
*  For that duck specifically. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8045.08s)]
*  Mallard Luther the King. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8047.08s)]
*  The King. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8049.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8051.08s)]
*  Do you think, some people think that guys like Mallard Luther King were compromised by the CIA. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8053.08s)]
*  Do you ever believe stuff like that? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8057.08s)]
*  Well, this kind of goes back to... [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8063.08s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of conspiracy theory stuff about that, you know? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8065.08s)]
*  Somebody says it's a conspiracy, but that doesn't make it the case. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8071.08s)]
*  In both of these cases that we've had these conversations, we are talking about the FBI and the CIA. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8075.08s)]
*  So, what do you think they do? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8083.08s)]
*  So, maybe we're unclear about what we think these agencies do. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8089.08s)]
*  So, now the question becomes, hey, do you think they be doing their job? [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8095.08s)]
*  I do. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8099.08s)]
*  I do think they be doing their job. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8101.08s)]
*  You mean all through history? [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8103.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8105.08s)]
*  Yes, I think they keep on doing their job. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8107.08s)]
*  You think they get everybody? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8109.08s)]
*  I think they get everybody. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8111.08s)]
*  So, again, not conspiracy theory at all. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8117.08s)]
*  I'm saying, the only way that there could be a FBI file for us to be able to get 30 years after his death is through the FBI. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8123.08s)]
*  As if there's a FBI file, correct? [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8133.08s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8135.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8137.08s)]
*  Damn, bro. Nobody could trust anybody. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8139.08s)]
*  That's a scary part to me sometimes. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8143.08s)]
*  The Bible said, do not put your trust in men. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8147.08s)]
*  It's pretty specific. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8153.08s)]
*  Why? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8155.08s)]
*  Because everybody can be compromised except you. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8157.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8161.08s)]
*  If you don't believe in God, then it's pretty messed up because now you only got you to believe in. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8163.08s)]
*  But if you got you and God, you can believe in both of those. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8169.08s)]
*  You can have peace then. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8175.08s)]
*  Have you had times in your life where you struggled having God in your life or what's that been like for you? [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8179.08s)]
*  No. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8183.08s)]
*  Do you have a practice that you use? [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8185.08s)]
*  One of my goals this year is to have more God in my life. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8189.08s)]
*  So for me, I'm just using more times where I stop and pray. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8193.08s)]
*  Even sometimes moments when my head will pop in like, you should hit your knees right now and pray. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8197.08s)]
*  Sometimes I just don't do those. I just go and keep doing it about my day. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8201.08s)]
*  But now when those hit me, I'm trying to just make sure I do that. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8203.08s)]
*  Because it's like an intuition that I have. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8207.08s)]
*  Because I want to have a stronger practice. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8209.08s)]
*  And understand the reason that it's special is because only you're going to know that it's working. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8211.08s)]
*  Right? [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8217.08s)]
*  There's going to be no evidence other than the evidence. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8219.08s)]
*  But you're going to know that. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8223.08s)]
*  Like, I have to be able to do that. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8227.08s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do it. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8231.08s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do it. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8233.08s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do it. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8235.08s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do it. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8237.08s)]
*  Like, I talk to God five and six times a day. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8239.08s)]
*  He has an accurate account of how I'm feeling about everything. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8247.08s)]
*  How I think things are going. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8253.08s)]
*  What I feel like I'm doing good at. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8255.08s)]
*  What I feel like I need help with. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8257.08s)]
*  These are our conversations. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8259.08s)]
*  So, I don't wonder why stuff gets moved out of my way. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8263.08s)]
*  Because I asked for things to be moved out of my way. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8271.08s)]
*  Like, you asked earlier. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8277.08s)]
*  Like, aren't you scared? [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8279.08s)]
*  Like, I'm not allowed to be scared. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8281.08s)]
*  Because I'm not counting on me. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8283.08s)]
*  You can't fuck me up because you're not allowed to fuck me up. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8288.08s)]
*  And I've been in enough situations to know that. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8294.08s)]
*  He ain't let me down yet. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8300.08s)]
*  Like, every time I needed his safety, it was there. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8302.08s)]
*  And will be. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8307.08s)]
*  And the more times you communicate, the better the relationship is. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8309.08s)]
*  And then you'll find that that works with the black girl from the airport, too. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8315.08s)]
*  Like, communication is key. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8321.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8325.08s)]
*  Oh, Lord, man. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8331.08s)]
*  Literally, huh? [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8333.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8337.08s)]
*  You're perfect when you don't even try. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8339.08s)]
*  Bam. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8341.08s)]
*  I've heard you say that you feel like we're about to enter like a golden era. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8344.08s)]
*  What do you mean kind of by that? [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8350.08s)]
*  Like, what feelings do you have about that? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8354.08s)]
*  And what can we look forward to? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8360.08s)]
*  I was just trying to be super positive at the time. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8364.08s)]
*  I wasn't trying to be actually accurate with the question. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8375.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8380.08s)]
*  The question was asked, I think, almost on New Year's or something like that. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8382.08s)]
*  Or Christmas, something like that. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8386.08s)]
*  It was pretty close to the top of the year. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8389.08s)]
*  I didn't want to say anything that would make anybody uncomfortable or awkward. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8392.08s)]
*  But the Bible has a book called Revelations, right? [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8402.08s)]
*  And it gives you this little metaphorical rundown of how things should go. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8411.08s)]
*  Bring it up real quick, or Revelations. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8421.08s)]
*  We can get a look at it. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8424.08s)]
*  There we go. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8433.08s)]
*  Book of Revelation or Book of the Apocalypse, the final book of the New Testament. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8438.08s)]
*  Correct. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8448.08s)]
*  So now, it talks about the things that will happen in what is called the last days, right? [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8449.08s)]
*  Before the second coming of Jesus, right? [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8462.08s)]
*  Because my whole life I was just trying to figure out like, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8466.08s)]
*  whatever it would take for Jesus to come back, [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8472.08s)]
*  why aren't all of the people around the world that love Jesus, [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8477.08s)]
*  why aren't they making sure that happens so he would come back? [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8481.08s)]
*  Yeah, like Santa, they leave milk and cookies out. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8488.08s)]
*  You think we would fucking leave out a couple of freaking- [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8491.08s)]
*  We're willing to go buy the presents ourselves and say you delivered them. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8495.08s)]
*  Put some sacred snacks out for him or something. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8499.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8503.08s)]
*  So, you know, it just tells a story of the little key things that will happen [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8504.08s)]
*  that you can look forward to before things get there, right? [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8513.08s)]
*  And so it talks about things like all of the nations will have to come together [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8519.08s)]
*  and make a group called the United Nations, you know? [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8527.08s)]
*  And this was written way back then and we have a United Nations now. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8535.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8539.08s)]
*  And it talks about there being wars and reports of wars in multiple places [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8540.08s)]
*  and it gives us a little guideline just to, you know, what may be happening in the future. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8547.08s)]
*  Like whenever Jesus comes back, where do you think it will be at? [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8557.08s)]
*  Well, the Bible is generally pretty specific about places generally. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8574.08s)]
*  So, like it talks about Armageddon, right? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8580.08s)]
*  And there's this actual valley of Armaged- I'm going to mispronounce it, but Armageddo. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8588.08s)]
*  But the valley of Armageddon that's supposed to take place, [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8598.08s)]
*  there's this valley that is named after, which really exists. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8602.08s)]
*  But wherever it is, he's going to bring it up. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8607.08s)]
*  But there's probably a war there now. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8611.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8617.08s)]
*  Right. So, here we are. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8618.08s)]
*  The valley of Megiddo, also known as Jezreel Valley, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8622.08s)]
*  is a large fertile plain in northern Israel. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8625.08s)]
*  It's known for its historical, theological, and geographical significance. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8627.08s)]
*  Oh, wow. And there's a lot of war going on right there, right now. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8631.08s)]
*  Correct. So, TBD, huh? [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8635.08s)]
*  What are some of the other animals that you have there? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8641.08s)]
*  I have heard that you have horses over there. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8646.08s)]
*  Is that a true cut that you have some horses over there? [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8648.08s)]
*  The donkeys are the stars over there. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8651.08s)]
*  But yeah, we got a lot of- yeah, we have cows. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8655.08s)]
*  We have mini cows. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8660.08s)]
*  Those are the best kind. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8663.08s)]
*  Mini cows and hot belly pigs. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8665.08s)]
*  How big are they? [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8668.08s)]
*  Probably about there, right there. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8669.08s)]
*  A mini cow? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8670.08s)]
*  Yeah, but- [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8671.08s)]
*  Bring up a mini cow real quick. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8672.08s)]
*  I want to see one of them. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8673.08s)]
*  They're beautiful, too. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8674.08s)]
*  My sister has a picture of a couple of them at her house. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8675.08s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8678.08s)]
*  Yeah, if we can find a white one, that'll be like Cash. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8679.08s)]
*  That's your name, Cash? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8684.08s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8686.08s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8687.08s)]
*  Are those milkable? [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8688.08s)]
*  He's a boy, so I don't- [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8690.08s)]
*  Oh, damn well, yeah. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8693.08s)]
*  I nodded. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8695.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8696.08s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8697.08s)]
*  So, you know, the blessing- he doesn't- he has no idea he's mini. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8699.08s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8705.08s)]
*  Yeah, ours is bigger than that, but yeah. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8706.08s)]
*  That beautiful little one right there. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8710.08s)]
*  Yeah, they're really fun. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8712.08s)]
*  And do you name- that one's named Cash, and what other name do you have for these animals? [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8715.08s)]
*  Well, all the animals, all the animals have names, except animals that might be delicious. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8720.08s)]
*  Like, goat is like my favorite meat, I think. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8734.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8742.08s)]
*  And so we have quite a few, you know. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8743.08s)]
*  And are you eating goat? [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8747.08s)]
*  Not Billy, he's the king of all the goats. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8748.08s)]
*  Right, right, but- [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8751.08s)]
*  But you're having a little bit of goat. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8752.08s)]
*  How much goat are you having monthly, you think? [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8753.08s)]
*  Weekly. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8759.08s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8760.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8761.08s)]
*  So Cat got him a little bit of money if he having a weekly goat meal, you know that, boy. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8762.08s)]
*  I'm a cannibal, you know. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8768.08s)]
*  Yes, sir, yes, sir. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8770.08s)]
*  Goat eat goat. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8771.08s)]
*  Goat eat goat, man. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8772.08s)]
*  Goat eat goat. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8773.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8774.08s)]
*  I love that. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8775.08s)]
*  He's making a little money. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8776.08s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8780.08s)]
*  I'm just trying to think. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8781.08s)]
*  I think sometimes I was just so- I was so nervous about who you are because you seem like such a like- [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8784.08s)]
*  You almost seem like something that came down off of Mount Rushmore to spend time with us today. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8789.08s)]
*  So I think that's like the mystique about you. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8793.08s)]
*  So I think sometimes I don't know when it's like, okay, to joke around and stuff, you know. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8797.08s)]
*  So you just try and figure it out as you go, you know. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8800.08s)]
*  I hope that that is not correct and you're just saying that because it is always okay to joke around me. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8803.08s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8811.08s)]
*  I definitely feel that for sure more than other interviews. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8812.08s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what else I want to ask you about. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8816.08s)]
*  This is the best picture I ever got about it. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8822.08s)]
*  Someone sent this and they said, this is- [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8828.08s)]
*  Kat Williams talking to Cam Newton, somebody said. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8832.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8838.08s)]
*  And that's what I'm thinking, man. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8840.08s)]
*  Yeah, because here's the thing. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8842.08s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8844.08s)]
*  Everything- yeah, we know that stupid picture of me. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8847.08s)]
*  Thanks. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8851.08s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8852.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8853.08s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even see that. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8854.08s)]
*  Can we take that down? [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8855.08s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8856.08s)]
*  Very racist. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8857.08s)]
*  You see how I became racist to me? [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8858.08s)]
*  No, but here's the facts. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8860.08s)]
*  The facts are, you know, everything we know about history, we know because of artifacts, things that were left behind. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8862.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8872.08s)]
*  And so to be heavily into the culture in a way that is represented is- [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8874.08s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8885.08s)]
*  It's a pretty big deal, you know? [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8886.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8888.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8889.08s)]
*  We should make one next year if we made one and we did make a charity for it or something. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8890.08s)]
*  That could be cool. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8894.08s)]
*  Right, but we would have to do you one too. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8898.08s)]
*  So like there would have to be a Theo Vonn as well. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8903.08s)]
*  I mean, I would be happy to do that. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8906.08s)]
*  Yours is really the- yours is the one they're already using without your permission. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8907.08s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8912.08s)]
*  They're already doing mine. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8913.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8914.08s)]
*  But maybe we'll try to find one. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8917.08s)]
*  That'd be kind of neat. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8918.08s)]
*  Maybe we could do some where we raise some money for something. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8919.08s)]
*  I would love it. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8922.08s)]
*  You would? [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8923.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8924.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8925.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8926.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8927.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm all about that. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8928.08s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8929.08s)]
*  We should do it for- yeah. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8930.08s)]
*  I'd be happy. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8931.08s)]
*  We should do it for autism. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8932.08s)]
*  We should do it for people on the spectrum. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8937.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8940.08s)]
*  And do they have- and everybody has autism. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8941.08s)]
*  Do they have all types of people with autism? [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8943.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8945.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8946.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would love to do that. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8947.08s)]
*  That's a cool idea. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8948.08s)]
*  And do you- my last question for you, Kat. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8949.08s)]
*  Do you know any Native Americans you ever met any over the years? [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8951.08s)]
*  What's that been like? [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8953.08s)]
*  Really cool. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8955.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8957.08s)]
*  I've met way more- I'm trying to figure out how to say it, but like- [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8959.08s)]
*  Because I've just heard these- some of these are just things that I've heard. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8967.08s)]
*  When you- I've met this tribe that- several times I've met several tribes, but the whole [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8970.08s)]
*  thing is you get this thing around them that you understand that they've been standing [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8982.08s)]
*  here. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8992.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8993.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8994.08s)]
*  Like, there's a- yeah, you understand how difficult it is to carry legacies and stories, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=8995.08s)]
*  even though your people have been getting destroyed. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9005.08s)]
*  And then when it's all at as bad as it could possibly be and everything is destroyed of [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9008.08s)]
*  your whole legacy, then they give you unlimited money and have casinos. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9016.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9022.08s)]
*  It's a mind-blowing thing to watch a people, a group of people still carry their legacy [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9023.08s)]
*  along. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9036.08s)]
*  And that's what you get. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9037.08s)]
*  And they know so much about so much. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9039.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9042.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9044.08s)]
*  And I'm an outdoor guy. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9045.08s)]
*  And they know everything about everything. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9047.08s)]
*  Like, fishing with them is like a whole different experience. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9051.08s)]
*  They're whistling them bitches in the boat. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9055.08s)]
*  Like, they don't make no mistakes. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9057.08s)]
*  Like, that whole part where you don't catch fish, they don't know shit about that. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9059.08s)]
*  Yeah, they catching bitches and half of them cooked. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9065.08s)]
*  They catching bitches. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9069.08s)]
*  They do it right. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9070.08s)]
*  I want you to come out of the water boneless. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9072.08s)]
*  Flays. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9077.08s)]
*  With outdoor stuff, have you ever done any like camping or anything like that? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9081.08s)]
*  You've done any long camps? [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9088.08s)]
*  Did you ever do like a plant medicine retreat or anything like that? [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9090.08s)]
*  No, but having a hundred acre ranch, you start getting in to trying to make sure you [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9093.08s)]
*  because first you have to figure out what you already have there. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9103.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9108.08s)]
*  Because I'm kind of, aren't you like close to Nashville? [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9109.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9112.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9113.08s)]
*  So I'm out in Mississippi on this farm, you see. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9114.08s)]
*  And so, you know, you're learning what's out there and then you're trying to accentuate [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9117.08s)]
*  what's already out there. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9123.08s)]
*  And because I think we probably got like 300 deer, like, wow. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9125.08s)]

*  course and so they had a little safe area in between them. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9151.08s)]
*  And then when houses start going, then it became neighborhoods. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9156.08s)]
*  Less and less. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9163.08s)]

*  And this particular area is where they all came to. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9168.08s)]

*  Cats, cats. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9191.08s)]
*  I'm never trying to do something that requires interaction. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9192.08s)]
*  Like what I'm doing is creating heaven on earth. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oik0NXo0-M&t=9196.08s)]
