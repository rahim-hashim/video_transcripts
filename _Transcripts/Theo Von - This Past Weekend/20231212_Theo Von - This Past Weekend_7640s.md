*  of like weirdly fish out of water, but not really. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=325.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=482.92s)]
*  How long did you move out? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=483.12s)]
*  Well, I bought a house about two, two or three years ago, um, in, in the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=484.12s)]
*  middle of nowhere in Indiana. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=489.56s)]
*  Um, and it was really about the house. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=491.0s)]
*  I mean, it was about a lot of things. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  It was, there's a lot of reasons behind making such an extreme move. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  But I love restoring old Victorian houses. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=500.12s)]
*  And, um, in LA, I used to have a house that was built in 1890 and this one [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=502.72s)]
*  was built in 1874, so it's a second empire style Victorian home and, uh, it [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=507.16s)]
*  was operating as a bed and breakfast for, for I think a few decades and, um, my [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=512.48s)]
*  husband and I went all like the lockdown stuff started happening in California. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=518.48s)]
*  We just saw a lot of a different facet to, to, to where we called home and we [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=522.24s)]
*  just didn't feel connected anymore. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=528.96s)]
*  We didn't really want to be there anymore. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=530.2s)]
*  And, uh, and so we, uh, looked up rural, rural towns in different states. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=532.2800000000001s)]
*  And I feel like, um, no one knows where this town is. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=538.48s)]
*  Even my friends in Indiana have like never heard of it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  And so that was a really good sign. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  We were like, let's, let's, let's find a place where we can be kind of left alone. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  And we went there and we loved it and, um, people say it's haunted, but [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  I haven't experienced that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=553.6s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=555.24s)]
*  Well, it's haunted by you now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=556.6s)]
*  It sounds like, because if it wasn't haunted, I feel like it kind of like, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=558.0s)]
*  now it's got its chance, you know, because, but also 1874, that is so crazy, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=561.96s)]
*  especially in Indiana, Indiana, I think had a lot of like, I don't know if they [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=568.4s)]
*  had like slave stuff up there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=572.96s)]
*  Well, actually like, um, so our house was built by Benjamin Franklin Schenck [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=575.0s)]
*  and he was, uh, the haymaker of the town. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=578.6s)]
*  So his family, um, made hay and they also owned a lot of the steamboats. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=582.32s)]
*  And, um, it's called Switzerland County because a lot of the original [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  settlers were from Switzerland. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  And what's really cool about, um, the, the Schenck family is that there's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=592.72s)]
*  actually underground tunnels that connected through underneath our house. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=598.08s)]
*  So they were pretty big advocates for, uh, helping out. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=601.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=604.36s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=604.72s)]
*  So the underground railroad stop there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=608.08s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=608.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=609.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=610.5200000000001s)]
*  I think I could see you being in a place that the underground railroad had [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=610.76s)]
*  stopped through and kind of Hogwarts probably passed through it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=613.4000000000001s)]

*  It's good. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=621.88s)]
*  The only way I know how to like accept things in the world is to pigeonhole. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=622.28s)]
*  Um, so was it tough choosing? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=626.28s)]
*  Cause that sounds like almost so much fun. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=629.92s)]
*  Like once you guys made that decision, was it hard to make that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=631.7199999999999s)]
*  decision to leave Los Angeles or? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=635.0799999999999s)]

*  And, um, and you know, we have a son too. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=641.68s)]
*  And I think like a little bit of what you were talking about before. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  Um, just there's pros and cons to everywhere you live. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=646.32s)]
*  You know, I think like LA has some really beautiful things about it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=650.24s)]
*  I love my friends. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=653.24s)]
*  I love the, I think LA has the best food, um, in this country, to be honest, but, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  um, it's just my own opinion. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=658.76s)]
*  And, you know, I like the pretty things. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=661.72s)]
*  I think there's like nice, like where I'm at, there's no sidewalks. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=665.36s)]
*  Like we just have like a lot of dirt roads and that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  So, um, we don't, there's no billboards. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=672.08s)]
*  There's no, um, Uber, nothing, no delivery services. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=674.4s)]
*  We have like one stoplight and a gas station and it's, I don't know. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=678.44s)]
*  I, I prefer the, the latter, you know? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=686.12s)]
*  Um, but I go to LA a lot because we still have like, I make music, my [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=686.6s)]
*  husband is a musician as well. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  So we fly back out a lot, all of our producer friends and stuff are there. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=691.24s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=694.8000000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=695.88s)]
*  I, uh, when you say of how it was interesting, like once you made the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=696.28s)]
*  choice, kind of, that was kind of the same for me. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=700.2s)]
*  Like I've been living in Los Angeles for maybe 16 years, I think. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=702.4000000000001s)]
*  And so I still have my apartment there, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=706.08s)]
*  Just because it's cheaper than going and even getting a hotel for when I do go back. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=709.24s)]
*  Um, I know I, when I go out there now, I stay with, with Charo. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=713.84s)]
*  She's my best friend and she, um, she's nice enough to give us like a little [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=717.72s)]
*  room in the back of her house. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=721.44s)]
*  And yeah, it's, it's, I look forward to it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=723.5200000000001s)]
*  I feel like, um, being able to see my friends and stuff, but, uh, but I also [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=726.8399999999999s)]
*  look forward to kind of escaping and just, um, you know, having like a safe haven. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=730.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=734.76s)]

*  That's exactly what I thought. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=736.24s)]
*  And once I made the decision, there was actually a, uh, a friend said you [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  should move to Nashville. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  And I was like, that's so weird. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=744.16s)]
*  And I talked to a friend of mine about it, an old friend of mine. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=745.68s)]
*  And he's like, dude, you used to talk about that when we lived in Nashville. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=748.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=751.4399999999999s)]

*  I was like, really? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=754.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't remember it, but I was like, yeah. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=756.0s)]
*  And so then I came here and before I knew what I had moved and I was like, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=758.3199999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=960.84s)]
*  Ornate is a wonderful word. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=961.04s)]
*  Ornate. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=962.04s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=962.6s)]
*  And yeah, I'm not trying to judge it, but I'm just judging you out loud and clearly. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=963.24s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=967.88s)]
*  I never thought about that. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=968.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=969.28s)]
*  I always like to pitch it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=969.52s)]
*  I put people in like little spaces that makes it feel, I don't know if it makes [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=970.76s)]
*  it feel manageable. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=974.6s)]
*  I never thought about that before. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  I like it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=976.8s)]
*  I mean, it's to me, it, it makes life a lot simple, more simple because I don't [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=977.28s)]
*  know, like I only wear black. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=982.16s)]
*  I know it's, it's a choice. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=984.12s)]
*  I just like it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=986.52s)]
*  I remember the day that it happened. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=987.16s)]
*  Like I had these beautiful dresses that I had accumulated over the years that I [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=989.4s)]
*  just, they were really colorful. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=993.7199999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I'm just never going to wear them. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=995.0799999999999s)]
*  Why, like, why am I kidding myself? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=996.7199999999999s)]
*  And I just gave everything away and just kept, I simplified everything. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=998.6s)]
*  And now I just, I just wear black and it's, I pigeonholed myself into this [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1002.4s)]
*  gothy corner, I guess. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1009.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1011.0s)]
*  But that's, that's, I like to wear black when I do stand up comedy because I [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1011.6s)]
*  don't like to make a lot of choices. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1015.88s)]
*  Like even this today for me was making, it took, this took a long time to figure [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1017.68s)]
*  out and, and, um, yeah. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1021.52s)]
*  And I just don't, I don't know. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1025.2s)]
*  I don't like making a lot of choices. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1026.6s)]
*  Um, but yeah, did you, did you guys look at some other places when you were [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1028.28s)]
*  looking for your home? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1031.52s)]
*  Um, because 1870, I mean, that's an old place. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1032.48s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1035.28s)]
*  Uh, we, we were looking at different states and, um, and I think, I think [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1036.28s)]
*  Indiana was appealing to me because I saw like the mass exodus of California [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1042.44s)]
*  happening and everybody was moving to Texas and Nashville. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1045.96s)]
*  And, um, I don't know what the other places were that they were. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1049.72s)]
*  I think those, those two are kind of some Nevada, I guess. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1053.24s)]
*  And I just wanted to get away from as much as I could from the California [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1056.2800000000002s)]
*  mentality in general. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1060.3600000000001s)]
*  So I was like, Indiana seems safe. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1061.2800000000002s)]
*  Like no one's going there. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1064.24s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1068.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1069.64s)]
*  And then, and I like, like our little town is it's cool because it's right on [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1070.52s)]
*  the Ohio river. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1075.72s)]
*  And so the houses along the river are like the prettiest, you know, cause [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1076.72s)]
*  they're, I don't know, I guess. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1083.28s)]
*  Cause you gotta have money to live out of water. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1083.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1084.76s)]
*  And then it's like, then we have like our little main street and it's just like [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  our, our downtown or whatever is literally one block long. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1088.8s)]
*  And then in between that and where my house is on, on the hill, it's kind of [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1093.72s)]
*  like houses that could use a lot of love, you know? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1097.36s)]
*  And I just felt like it, no one's going to move here, you know? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1101.72s)]
*  Like if they, like, okay, so you're from in California, you know, like [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1105.9199999999998s)]
*  Silverlake and Echo Park. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1110.2s)]
*  I was around when that was just super ghetto. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1111.56s)]
*  Like, you know, nobody in the right mind would move there. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like, it was actually quite dangerous in some areas. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1116.6799999999998s)]
*  And now it's like, good luck finding a tiny place for less than $1.2 million. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1119.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1126.04s)]
*  And so I feel like I've bought myself a lot of time finding a place [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1126.8s)]
*  that's not going to get changed. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1131.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1133.04s)]
*  Like I don't want, you know. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1133.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1136.6799999999998s)]
*  You don't want, uh, yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1136.9199999999998s)]
*  You wanted to get as far away from that as possible. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1138.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1140.76s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1141.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1141.8s)]
*  What were some scary parts about moving into a house that old? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1142.8s)]
*  Like what are things that people do not think about, I guess? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1145.48s)]
*  Um, cause that's old, bro. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1147.84s)]
*  That's like, that's only, I mean, that's, that's pretty old. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1149.28s)]
*  I mean, 1874 that you can't even really get much older. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1154.6s)]
*  I don't think that would before. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1157.8s)]
*  I feel like not in America. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1159.0s)]
*  I feel like there are some houses from the late 1700s, I guess. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1160.04s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1165.0s)]
*  When did people start using wood to build houses? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1165.9199999999998s)]
*  Cause at some point we evolve probably from it's like a regional thing, really. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1169.8799999999999s)]
*  Cause you know, like on the East coast, you don't have earthquakes. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1173.84s)]
*  So you can have a lot more bricks. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1178.56s)]
*  Oh, it's true. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1180.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1181.24s)]
*  So what's the most popular piece of, uh, house building material? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, it's expensive now just because of inflation and everything. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1188.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1192.0400000000002s)]
*  These days. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1192.64s)]
*  Dang. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  You got to, oh, it is thought the first wooden structure was built over 10,000 [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1193.72s)]
*  years ago, Europe's Neolithic long house constructed in around 5,000, 6,000 BC. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1197.6000000000001s)]
*  And it is an example of the earliest freestanding timber dwellings. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1202.2s)]
*  Huh? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1205.68s)]
*  So, wow. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1206.64s)]
*  5,000, 6,000 BC. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1207.2s)]
*  So that's like almost 8,000 years ago. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1209.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1211.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1212.28s)]
*  But I guess it makes sense, dude. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1213.8s)]
*  If you're standing around and you're cold or something, and they got a lot of [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1215.04s)]
*  sticks around, if you don't do something, you're an idiot. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1219.0s)]
*  I think no offense to whoever that guy is, you know, but you gotta like, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1223.28s)]
*  you gotta figure it out, dude. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1227.4s)]
*  There's only so long, you can just go like this, you know, before you [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1230.4s)]
*  try to change the game, you know? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1233.2s)]
*  Um, oh, and the most common building material in the world is concrete. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1235.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1238.92s)]
*  It is the most widely used building material in the world, making it a [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1239.76s)]
*  good starting material to get to know. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1244.76s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1246.96s)]
*  Um, what did you guys have to do to the home when you got there? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1247.68s)]
*  Uh, we're actually still renovating it right now. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1250.48s)]
*  So, so actually we don't live in it yet because it's, um, there's just so much [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1252.56s)]
*  work having to redo a house like that. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1258.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, so we live actually at our church's parsonage. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1262.0s)]
*  So, um, the pastor from our church lives in Louisville. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  And so he, him and his wife will, they drive up every Sunday. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1269.96s)]
*  So they were like, Hey, you know, there's just no place to rent out there. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1274.56s)]
*  Like there's literally no, like people, people live there forever and then they [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1277.56s)]
*  pass it down or sell or whatever. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1281.1200000000001s)]
*  So, um, when we first moved out here, we're like, man, where are we going to live? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1283.16s)]
*  And then they were just so nice enough to let us stay there. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1286.56s)]
*  Oh, that's nice of them. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1288.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1289.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1290.52s)]
*  So you were in a place where there's like not even a really a real estate market. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1290.8s)]

*  couldn't get an Uber at night. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1296.8s)]
*  It was like, it was like, what is kind of a busy, but it was like, I [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1297.96s)]
*  guess everywhere doesn't really have it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1301.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1302.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1304.6799999999998s)]
*  Um, what have been some neat things about being out there? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1305.6799999999998s)]
*  Like in this that, um, well, I homeschool my son and so it's, I like that. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1307.96s)]
*  Um, Indiana has, um, they're very supportive. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1314.12s)]
*  Like the state of Indiana is very supportive to homeschool families and stuff. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1316.96s)]
*  So that was a very big selling point for us. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1319.96s)]
*  And why is it hard to do? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1322.2s)]
*  Is there like a lot of regulation? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1323.68s)]
*  With some, some States and different places have different. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1324.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1327.5600000000002s)]
*  So I'm, to me, I'm like the less government, the better. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1328.24s)]
*  So I was like, you know, that's, that's one of the perks of the state of Indiana. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1330.6000000000001s)]
*  And so, um, so yeah, like I, my, my son just turned five, um, last week. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  So we're, you know, getting ready to start like a first grade. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1339.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1344.1200000000001s)]
*  I know it's so cool. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1345.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1347.0s)]
*  And so do you like have to redesign the room for like the learning room or [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1347.56s)]
*  whatever each year to make the grade seem different or, um, I don't, I mean, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1352.52s)]
*  right now he's like, we're not doing crazy curriculum cause he's just turned five. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1355.9199999999998s)]
*  So, um, but once we get into the house, I do plan on having like a little school [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1361.2s)]
*  room area, but that's the cool thing about homeschooling is that you can. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1365.24s)]
*  Teach anywhere really. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1368.72s)]
*  Um, I feel like the idea of putting your kid in a, you know, like a, like a school [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1370.0s)]
*  or a classroom setting, it's, I think that's kind of people are tending to steer [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1377.48s)]
*  away from that in a lot of places. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1383.4s)]
*  So, yeah, well, it feels, some of it starts to feel dangerous too. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1385.0800000000002s)]
*  It seems like there's a lot of violence in school. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1388.52s)]
*  In school. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1390.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1391.2s)]
*  It seems really like, but I don't know, maybe that's just like the algorithm, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1391.8400000000001s)]
*  like for some reason sends me those videos sometimes, but it seems like [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1395.76s)]
*  there's like a lot of violence in schools, but I don't know. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1398.96s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why I chose to live in Tennessee. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1402.6000000000001s)]
*  It's very safe or in Nashville. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1404.2s)]
*  It's very safe here. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1405.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  It's super safe. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1407.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  And, um, yeah, but I don't go to school anymore, so I don't know what it's like. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1408.48s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1414.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't go to, I didn't go to school. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1414.72s)]
*  You didn't? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1416.8s)]
*  I, I started tattooing when I was 14 years old and then I, I remember the first [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1417.72s)]
*  time I ever did a tattoo, I'm like, this is what I want to do. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1421.92s)]
*  Like I already, I just knew it in my heart. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1423.96s)]
*  And so I was like, why would I spend so much time in school and I don't need to, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1426.4799999999998s)]
*  you know, not that I would condone people dropping out or anything like that, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1432.04s)]
*  but it worked for me. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1435.28s)]
*  And I, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1436.08s)]
*  Oh, people will do it without you condoning it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1436.4399999999998s)]
*  A lot of people are just don't like it or they're not even smart and they don't [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1438.8799999999999s)]
*  like it. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1442.7199999999998s)]
*  Um, do you, your family started in your family, cause you are, you're from [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1443.6s)]
*  another country, your family's from another country. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1451.9599999999998s)]
*  So my family's from South America, from Argentina, and I was born in Mexico. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1452.1599999999999s)]
*  And then I moved here in the eighties. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1455.2s)]
*  What were they doing there? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1457.24s)]
*  My dad was a missionary for the church. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1458.2s)]
*  So they were, he's like long line of, um, like missionary doctors. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1459.96s)]
*  And so he was building, um, hospitals and like little pueblitos that didn't [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1464.96s)]
*  have any hospitals. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1469.6000000000001s)]
*  And, um, and then my, my, me and my siblings were born there. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1470.76s)]
*  So it was, it was pretty cool upbringing. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1474.0s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1476.64s)]
*  Um, we came from nothing, like literally nothing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1476.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1479.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1480.48s)]
*  We had like dirt floors and no running water. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1480.88s)]
*  And it was like truly third world, but it's cool. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1483.0s)]
*  And you're from Nicaragua. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1486.48s)]
*  My father's my father's from there. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1487.56s)]
*  My father, my grand, my father's, my grandfather, I guess, was a missionary. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1489.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1494.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1494.76s)]
*  And they were down in Nicaragua and that's where my dad was born. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1495.0s)]
*  Cause that's where my grandfather, I guess, met his wife or something. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1499.36s)]
*  And then that's where my dad was born at. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1503.16s)]
*  Um, and so he grew up there. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1505.56s)]
*  He used to tell me stories about kids in his village that would, that would eat [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1508.0s)]
*  dirt actually. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1511.48s)]
*  And they didn't have anything to eat and they would eat dirt and their [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1513.0s)]
*  stomachs would get like all distended and stuff. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1515.36s)]
*  Like he would tell me some kind of crazy stories, but, um, but yeah, that's [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1517.24s)]

*  but it also feels like the only people that maybe will have a lot of the same ins like [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1763.04s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1772.24s)]
*  I think it's interesting to be, I think a family is something you really have to build [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1772.64s)]
*  and has to be put together pretty well by the, by the parents a lot of times. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1775.84s)]

*  But I think it's kind of the opposite where like, or what you said, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1796.72s)]
*  where you have to work at it if you really want it to, you know, be a good relationship, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1800.16s)]

*  I'm really close with my dad and I'm trying to talk him into moving out with us. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1824.5600000000002s)]

*  came up and on YouTube there was like a like a house tour that these guys. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1967.76s)]
*  They like rented out the bed and breakfast. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1971.84s)]
*  But I don't know if they told them they were going to film and they were just like kind [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1973.44s)]
*  of dressed. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1977.36s)]
*  I don't want to say goth, but like just older gentlemen. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1978.24s)]
*  And they were just like really wanting to catch some paranormal activity. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1981.6s)]
*  And it's so bad. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1985.52s)]
*  Like there was it was like dust in the air and they're like, did you see the orb? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1986.96s)]
*  You know, it's like there's no there's nothing there, you know. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1990.24s)]
*  But but I don't know. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1992.32s)]
*  I haven't I haven't experienced anything there. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1994.08s)]
*  But the shank mansion there it is. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1996.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1998.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1999.36s)]
*  House was restored in 2000 and operated in a bed and breakfast. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=1999.76s)]
*  It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2001.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, look, it says that I bought it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2004.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2007.52s)]
*  So that's cool. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2007.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2009.8400000000001s)]
*  So back to the tulip thing. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2010.4s)]
*  So so there's this plot of land that's right in like right outside our gate. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  And and it's just it's just grass. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2015.92s)]
*  And the lady who sold me the house, she owns it, my friend Lisa. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2018.64s)]
*  And so I hit Lisa up and I was like, hey, look, I got a bunch of tulips and I thought [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2021.2s)]
*  it would be cool just to just to bring something to the community, you know, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2028.08s)]
*  just have because people are coming here to take pictures anyway. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2030.48s)]
*  So why not? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  I give them something like really cool to look at. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2033.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2035.28s)]
*  And so I got ten thousand black tulips and I thought like this is going to be an enormous [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2035.6799999999998s)]
*  like just a field of tulips. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2043.12s)]
*  BTM, bro. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2045.76s)]
*  Ten thousand is a lot. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2046.6399999999999s)]
*  And then we did the math and the square footage is like it's not that big. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2048.08s)]
*  Like I feel like it's maybe twice the size of this room. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2051.7599999999998s)]
*  The tulip. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2054.72s)]
*  What? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2055.44s)]
*  Ten thousand of them. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2056.0s)]
*  Oh, that's all it makes? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2056.96s)]
*  Yeah, because you plant them about three, three to four inches apart. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2058.4s)]
*  So I feel like I guess they don't want to be far away from each other. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2062.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2065.68s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2066.0s)]
*  So we're a little bit more like spread out. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2066.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2070.32s)]
*  Just like they're cool with kind of doing their own thing. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2070.56s)]
*  I mean, apparently, tulips are kind of like, I guess they're I guess they get lonesome or [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2073.52s)]
*  whatever. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2078.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2079.04s)]
*  Or, you know, whatever it's called. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2079.28s)]
*  I don't know what the what that would be like as a flower. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2080.48s)]
*  Like what? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2082.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2083.68s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2083.92s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2084.48s)]
*  We have like, you know, wildlife out there and everybody in my Instagram was like, you [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2084.8s)]
*  know, be careful because the squirrels are going to eat, they're going to dig them up [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2091.6s)]
*  or the mole. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2094.1600000000003s)]
*  So we're hoping that by the time spring comes, they don't eat all of them. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2094.8s)]
*  But dude, if you had an only fans of you just fighting moles, I think a lot of people [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2098.8s)]
*  subscribe to it. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2105.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think you get a lot of the hunting audience. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2106.08s)]
*  You know, how do you fight a mole? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2108.2400000000002s)]
*  Though I don't know. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2112.1600000000003s)]
*  That's up to you. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2112.96s)]
*  But I think it would just be pretty fascinating to watch. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2114.2400000000002s)]
*  Do you feel different being out of L.A.? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2119.1200000000003s)]
*  What does that kind of feel like? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2121.36s)]
*  Does it feel like were you kind of done with entertainment? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2123.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, you've had it. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2126.96s)]
*  You've had a neat career and at least gotten to experience, you know, certain things, you [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2127.92s)]
*  know, like that's that's one thing about having a different opportunity. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2132.0800000000004s)]
*  Sometimes at least you get to experience what it's like, whether you whether it was [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2135.1200000000003s)]
*  great or you didn't like it. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2139.44s)]
*  You get experience, you know? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2140.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2141.76s)]
*  I mean, I'm still I haven't retired yet. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2141.92s)]
*  So, I mean, I feel like like you said, you know, the beauty of being able to create and [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2143.84s)]
*  do things that you don't necessarily have to be in L.A. anymore. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2149.6s)]
*  And so I think before you used to, I feel you had to live in L.A. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  if you needed it, if you wanted to do things. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2155.12s)]
*  But but now it's like I mean, I make music so I can do that from my house. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2156.64s)]
*  I don't need to or I could fly in and record or I don't necessarily have to live in Hollywood [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2161.84s)]
*  anymore. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2166.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's nice. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2167.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2168.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2168.48s)]
*  Um, what else can we think about? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, so like, did you know that in the state of Indiana, like you're not it's illegal to [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2174.88s)]
*  to own a squirrel. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2179.84s)]
*  Um, I found this out because my my son found like a little a little baby squirrel that [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2182.32s)]
*  had fallen out of a tree. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2187.52s)]
*  And it happens a lot. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2188.48s)]
*  Like squirrels fall out of trees and stuff. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2189.92s)]
*  And and this one was like barely breathing and really dehydrated. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2192.0s)]
*  And I used to work at the California Wildlife Center and back in in California. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2196.8s)]
*  And so like rehabilitating squirrels is pretty easy. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2200.8s)]
*  It's not. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2203.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like, you know, like a an owl or something. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2204.4s)]
*  Like, do you need two hands to do it? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2208.6400000000003s)]
*  You can do it one hand. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2209.92s)]
*  You probably need two hands to do it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2210.88s)]
*  Yeah, too, because you have to like feed them with this little like syringe thing. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2213.1200000000003s)]
*  OK, but so we rehabilitated it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2216.32s)]
*  My son named him Lucky's like the cutest thing ever. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2218.8s)]
*  And then I I got baptized and then I got like a bunch of criticism about this baptism video. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2221.44s)]
*  So I had to make this. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2229.12s)]
*  I didn't have to. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2230.08s)]
*  I was inspired to make a video like calling out like judgmental Christians or whatever. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2230.88s)]
*  And and in that video, Lucky is just like just like flying behind me. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2235.44s)]
*  He's just like running around and somebody saw him and reported me to the animal control. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2241.04s)]
*  And they they showed up like the guy showed up with like a gun and everything was like, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2247.2s)]
*  hey, do you have you guys have a squirrel? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2252.48s)]
*  Like, you know, you can't have one, so we're going to have to take it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2254.24s)]
*  And I'm like, they put him in cuffs. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2256.96s)]
*  No, no, no, but they. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2259.3599999999997s)]
*  So I asked the guy, I was like, are you going to euthanize him? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2264.16s)]
*  Because I know that's what you guys do. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2266.08s)]
*  What are you going to you're not going to house him. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2267.4399999999996s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, it's going to get euthanized. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2269.9199999999996s)]
*  No, are you kidding me? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2271.68s)]
*  So they took him out of a warm home. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2274.3999999999996s)]
*  Of course they didn't take him. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2275.92s)]
*  Oh, you kept him. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  I lied and I told them I'm going to release him the next day. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2278.0s)]
*  And then we made like a little Instagram video like. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2281.12s)]
*  Of him leaving? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2283.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2284.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2284.56s)]
*  And we don't have to tell anybody if he came back or not. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2285.12s)]
*  You got it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2288.8s)]
*  Lucky lives elsewhere. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2289.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2291.52s)]

*  like there's no intricacies a lot of times with like laws and rules, you know, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2303.1200000000003s)]
*  it's just for this general thing. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2308.1600000000003s)]
*  And so it's and they don't have any room to band a lot of these guys who come to, you know, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2310.0s)]
*  it's like they're just trying to do the whatever the. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2314.2400000000002s)]

*  they have to release that call that call. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2351.52s)]
*  You should remix a beat to that call. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2354.56s)]
*  And that you should. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2356.2400000000002s)]
*  I wish they did. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2357.6s)]
*  I'm one of the best house songs. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2358.32s)]

*  Well, the best is like it was my husband that opened the door and he was like topless [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2365.52s)]
*  with like and he's like fully tattooed with the squirrel on his shoulder. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2369.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, then that didn't help. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2374.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2375.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2375.76s)]
*  People are like people are trying to get this. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2376.32s)]
*  They're trying to get this animal in M Squirrel 13 over here. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2378.2400000000002s)]
*  Like there's not this bad stuff going on out here. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2382.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2388.8s)]

*  but like what was like what like role has religion like played in your life and stuff? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2392.7200000000003s)]
*  Because, you know, I think it's we're at a time in the world. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2396.88s)]
*  I think it just in I think we're always at a time in the world, but I think we're [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2400.7200000000003s)]
*  it feels like a lot of people are looking for something that makes sense more. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2404.32s)]
*  I feel like we're getting exhausted by the truth that a lot of the things [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2409.04s)]
*  that we feel like will make us feel good aren't doing it, you know? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2414.9599999999996s)]

*  Oh, it's pretty there. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2444.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2445.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2445.6s)]
*  On your profession of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in obedience to his divine command, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2445.84s)]
*  I baptize you my sister in the name of the father and the son and the Holy Spirit. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2455.36s)]
*  Oh, congratulations. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2464.32s)]
*  I still get teary eyed when I see that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2466.64s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2468.4s)]
*  It's powerful. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2470.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2471.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2472.1600000000003s)]
*  What is that like in your life? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2472.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2475.12s)]
*  What's it like? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2477.36s)]
*  How do you get there? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2478.08s)]
*  Like, how do you get because I think a lot of people are lost. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2478.88s)]
*  I feel lost a lot of times. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2481.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2482.96s)]
*  I think a lot of us feel that way. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2483.44s)]
*  And so how do you feel like you solved like you're lost? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2485.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, or is that even a fair question? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2489.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2491.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2492.1600000000003s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2492.64s)]
*  I was brought up with Christianity in my childhood and then I strayed. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2494.24s)]
*  And so like in a nutshell, I just kind of in the last five years have like made my way back [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2501.2s)]
*  and have a different understanding than maybe when I was a kid. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2506.0s)]
*  Because I think when you're a kid, you're like, or at least for me, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2510.16s)]
*  it was like we just go to church because that's what we have to do. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2512.72s)]
*  And, you know, I don't I didn't have actual profound questions that I want answered like [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2515.12s)]
*  I do now. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2524.16s)]
*  And so I think as an adult, you get to have a different understanding of that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2524.96s)]
*  And so that's kind of what you know, how I in a weird artsy way just kind of came back. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2529.52s)]
*  And I just the last five years have just been studying the Bible. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2536.0s)]
*  And now like at this church, like we have our women's Bible study and stuff that I attend. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2539.36s)]
*  And I just have a meeting you go to. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2545.36s)]
*  Right. I watched another podcast that you were on. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2547.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2550.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2550.5600000000004s)]
*  I heard you talk about anyway, that you guys have a Bible study each week. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2552.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2554.8s)]
*  And, you know, I think I'm going to always have questions and continue to want to learn and have [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2556.6400000000003s)]
*  deeper understandings of things. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2562.96s)]
*  And so but I in that podcast that you probably watched, like I talk about like a little bit [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2564.56s)]
*  what you said. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2570.08s)]
*  It's like we're trying to find meaning or want to feel again, you know, and I think [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2570.88s)]
*  there's a lot of temporary fixes or, you know, like, you know, I used to like I was an addict [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2576.08s)]
*  and I'm so I'll have I'll have 17 years sober in July. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2582.32s)]
*  And so, you know, I think I feel like those are all things that kind of like lead you in that in [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2586.72s)]
*  that direction. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2590.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2591.28s)]
*  Yeah. I think, you know, it's such an intimate and personal thing. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2592.16s)]
*  Like my relationship with God is my own. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2597.04s)]
*  And and I've never really felt like I belonged anywhere. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2599.92s)]
*  Like, especially now, I think, like being public with my faith puts you into like this [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2604.88s)]
*  microscopic critical tank, you know. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2614.08s)]
*  And so I get criticized from from all sides now, which I don't care because at the end of the day, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2618.48s)]
*  you know, my relationships with with God, not you. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2624.96s)]
*  But right. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2627.36s)]
*  But it is interesting. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2628.72s)]
*  I feel like now it just becomes funny. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2629.76s)]
*  Like some of the comments I get, I think because people have a hard time understanding the [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2631.84s)]
*  aesthetic and pairing that with something which is your aesthetic. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2635.68s)]
*  You mean? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2640.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2640.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2640.64s)]
*  The ambiance of you and the compare and then pairing it in Christianity. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2640.88s)]
*  And it's so silly to me. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2644.2400000000002s)]
*  And like, I don't understand how people don't see how close minded that is, you know, and how [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2645.28s)]
*  like, yeah, why would you think that you have to look a certain way to to have an understanding [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2649.92s)]
*  of the Bible, you know? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2655.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2656.8s)]
*  Or, you know. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2657.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point, too. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2658.8s)]
*  I think it's all a lot of that. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2660.32s)]
*  There's a lot of interesting stuff there, you know. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2661.92s)]
*  Yeah, like I do. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2664.1600000000003s)]
*  But, you know, so there's a lot to think about in all of this. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2665.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2668.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, like one time I went to like a Jordan Peterson lecture and my [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2668.96s)]
*  husband and I were like the only people that looked like us there. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2674.88s)]
*  But I was. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2678.8s)]
*  Black people, you mean? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2680.2400000000002s)]
*  You mean black people? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2680.6400000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2682.2400000000002s)]
*  I just like and I don't want to dis on like Jordan's fan base, but I feel like [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2687.28s)]
*  everybody had their own uniform, you know, like there was just rows of people in front [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2691.92s)]
*  of me and they all kind of dressed the same. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2696.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2698.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2699.2000000000003s)]
*  And I was like, man, for some for people and I'm not again, not judging or criticizing, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2699.52s)]
*  but you would think that like free free thinkers would or maybe they just don't care. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2703.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2709.6s)]
*  Well, maybe there's just only so many stores, too, where you can. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2710.4s)]
*  I mean, I feel like it's a lot of Johnson and Merck guys who like are sad. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2713.44s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2717.04s)]
*  I'm a Jordan Peterson fan, but I'm like, I think it's a lot of like there's, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2718.16s)]
*  you know, it's a lot of lost boys, but who have and who can comprehend well or well enough, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2722.48s)]
*  you know, because otherwise lost boys who can't comprehend, they kind of, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2732.56s)]
*  you know, they listen to maybe Huba stank or whatever, you know, but I think if you get or, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2736.56s)]
*  or, hey, come out and fight, remember that song? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2743.44s)]
*  You got to keep them separated. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2747.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2749.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2749.6s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2749.68s)]
*  Offspring? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2751.04s)]
*  Offspring. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2751.68s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2752.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2753.36s)]
*  So yeah, if you are a lost boy who can't communicate as well as you'd like to sometimes, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2753.68s)]
*  and this is a judgment, but you probably have owned an offspring album. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2760.32s)]
*  And then if you are a different version, then it's sometimes Jordan Peterson. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  But yeah, I could not imagine seeing it. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2768.96s)]
*  It would be like playing Where's Waldo if I saw you at a Jordan Peterson concert. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2770.96s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2778.6400000000003s)]
*  But that's awesome that you guys went and you found like that, that what the. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2780.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, so I, so my whole point was just that I feel like, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2783.36s)]
*  maybe we pigeonhole ourselves, right? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2787.44s)]
*  Like, I feel like everybody kind of like, I went to this, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2789.76s)]
*  so the church I go to is like a really small church and it's, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2795.2000000000003s)]
*  there's not enough people to have a running trend or anything like that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2798.7200000000003s)]
*  But when I went to like a big church in California recently, I looked around and it's like, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2803.6000000000004s)]
*  a lot of people have the same, same style. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2807.1200000000003s)]
*  And so I realized that maybe because like modern day Christians are so used to being [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2809.28s)]
*  surrounded by people that look the same as them, when someone like, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2815.6s)]
*  like me comes into the mix, it's like, oh, wait, this is demonic or this is, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2820.0s)]
*  because I get called demonic a lot or, or this is like, you know, you're serving two masters. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2825.52s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't think any of that is accurate. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2830.48s)]
*  You know, I don't think you have to, there's no dress code to be a Christian. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2833.68s)]
*  Oh, that's baffling to me. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2838.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I get it a lot. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2840.48s)]
*  I just recently posted this, like my last post was just, I thought was like a very cool, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2842.2400000000002s)]
*  like modest image of me, like in a dress and some funny shoes. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2849.28s)]
*  And I just, oh, the comments are just hilarious. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2854.08s)]
*  It's just people like, Satan's gonna bring you home. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2857.04s)]
*  And just things like that's crazy. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2859.52s)]
*  I guess there's all levels of everything. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2863.28s)]
*  Like, even if you get into like the Christian, like if you like, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2865.2000000000003s)]
*  I thought I was going to get hate from my existing fans. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2868.0s)]
*  Like just people who are like, feel like you could be a deserter or something, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2871.52s)]
*  or maybe people that are fans of yours that are, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2875.6s)]
*  don't have a religion or aren't Christians or something. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2878.56s)]
*  They would have a thought about it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2880.7999999999997s)]
*  No, they've been super loving and open-minded and I love that, you know, but it's been the other, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2882.16s)]
*  the other side that I was just so surprised. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2888.08s)]
*  But yeah, you know, that's, it's like, I think there's a lot of like interesting [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2890.3199999999997s)]
*  stigmas with Christianity, I guess. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2896.16s)]
*  Like I love, I like religion, right? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2898.7999999999997s)]
*  I like, I don't know if I care what religion people are. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2900.88s)]
*  I think I wish I knew more about some of the religions, you know? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2907.28s)]
*  I probably prefer Christianity for myself because that's what I know the most. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2912.08s)]
*  But, or I would say that I prefer God. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2921.12s)]
*  That's the term I like to use. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2923.12s)]
*  And most of my belief started through AA, through going to 12-step meetings. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2924.64s)]
*  It was like the first time I ever like started to get like an understanding of [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2932.48s)]
*  like starting to build a relationship with God and talking to God and feeling like that if I [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2938.7999999999997s)]
*  think or feel something that there's something on the other side of the universe that hears it [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2944.56s)]
*  or cares about it, right? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2949.44s)]
*  And that, it blew my mind, dude, because, you know, I've been, I've been electrocuted [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2951.52s)]
*  a couple of times. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2958.08s)]
*  You have? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2958.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, but I never had a feeling like this. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2959.6s)]
*  It's not like being electrocuted. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2962.96s)]
*  It's just like feeling like- [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2964.08s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2965.12s)]
*  You've been electrocuted? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2966.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I've been electrocuted, dude. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2968.2400000000002s)]
*  I've been electrocuted, yeah. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2969.52s)]
*  I mean, I guess a handful of times or whatever. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2971.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2974.96s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2975.6s)]
*  One time I got electrocuted at a carnival when I was young. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2976.88s)]
*  I got electrocuted. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2979.36s)]
*  Oh, three years ago I stepped on, I was walking behind a hot food truck and I stepped, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2980.0s)]
*  they had a plug-in, a big joint plug-in and I stepped right on it and just, it just, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2987.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, I wasn't, it was like the opposite of being baptized. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2994.4s)]
*  I think it was uncomfortable. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=2999.84s)]
*  But yeah, but I was, yeah, but I, yeah, I like thinking about God. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3003.44s)]
*  I love thinking about it now. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3009.76s)]
*  You know, I was just asking God this morning just to help me, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3011.36s)]
*  just to help give me some better direction in my life, you know? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3015.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3018.1600000000003s)]
*  And help me with a few things I've been struggling with. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3018.7200000000003s)]
*  Like I've been struggling to quit vaping, right? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3021.04s)]
*  So I don't want to vape and so it's just been so hard and I realized like I'm an addict. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3022.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3027.04s)]
*  You know, it's like, dude, I will wake up in the middle of the night [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3027.44s)]
*  and like see if there's vape places open and stuff. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3030.88s)]
*  And then some assholes started stoping in 24 hours. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3033.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3037.76s)]
*  Cigarettes was the hardest for me. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3039.2s)]
*  I love, oh my gosh, I love smoking. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3040.56s)]
*  I love cigarettes, but I just can't, I don't want to be that mom. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3043.52s)]
*  Well, it became my, like vaping became my higher power in a lot of ways. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3050.24s)]
*  Like if I have an uncomfortable thought, feeling, moment, whatever, let me hit this thing. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3054.24s)]
*  And so I realized, oh, this is the thing. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3060.0s)]
*  I'm serving this, like whether I want to have a higher power, whatever I want it to be, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3061.68s)]
*  this is whatever I am serving this thing. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3067.6800000000003s)]
*  I show up when this, whenever the little like a pain goes off inside of me, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3070.1600000000003s)]
*  I show up for this thing. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3074.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3075.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3077.52s)]
*  My life revolves around smoking too. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3078.8s)]
*  And it's funny because you start like treating it as like little treats. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3080.56s)]
*  Like I would be tattooing and I'd be like, all right, I'll just get through like two hours [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3085.12s)]
*  and then I get a treat and then, you know, you get these little breaks and stuff. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3088.4s)]
*  And then, but then everything like life becomes an inconvenience for, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3092.08s)]
*  at least for me. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3096.08s)]
*  I've never talked about this before, by the way. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3097.2s)]
*  Like I feel like usually when I talk about like sobriety and stuff, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3098.96s)]
*  we're talking about like drugs and, but cigarettes were the hardest. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3101.52s)]
*  I mean, I just, I love the ritual of it. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3104.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3328.96s)]

*  That's how it was when I would do drugs too. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3609.2s)]
*  I remember in the beginning, it was fun party time, you're out with your friends. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3611.3599999999997s)]
*  And then the minute that I realized, oh no, this is mine, I would just start doing drugs by myself. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3615.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, me too. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3620.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3621.6s)]
*  That was it. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3622.3199999999997s)]
*  Like no sharing because there's so many freeloaders. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3623.12s)]
*  And I was one of them, first of all, and I'd finally gotten some drugs. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3627.4399999999996s)]
*  So the last thing, yeah, it's finally time I get to freeload off myself. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3631.12s)]
*  You know, but yeah, I would go home, I would get cocaine, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3635.2s)]
*  I would go home and just do it by myself and it would be sad. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3638.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3640.64s)]
*  Oh, it was the saddest man. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3641.2s)]
*  I don't know why, but yeah, people do that. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3644.64s)]
*  But yeah, I think through like going to 12 step meetings is where I [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3647.8399999999997s)]
*  started to build a relationship with a higher power and really believe in one. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3653.04s)]
*  Before that, I just never had it presented to me in a way that felt, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3657.2s)]
*  I don't know, that it like meshed, you know? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3661.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3667.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3669.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that's important, I think is how it comes into your life too, you know, a lot of times. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3670.3999999999996s)]
*  And I just like having our power, like having an invisible friend that, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3677.8399999999997s)]
*  yeah, I like having an invisible friend. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3682.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3684.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like I came from the school of thought where, you know, you have to be like empowered and, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3686.02s)]
*  you know, just believe in yourself and all this idea that you know, it's kind of almost like self-worship. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3695.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think NAA, you know, they do talk about that, where it's like that, you know, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3701.7000000000003s)]
*  you can't do this on your own. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3708.5800000000004s)]
*  And I think taking that to like the bigger picture part of it, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3710.34s)]
*  where it's not just with addiction that for me, I'm like, I've definitely surrendered to that. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3714.18s)]
*  And I don't think there's anything wrong, you know, to humble yourself and be like, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3717.7799999999997s)]
*  I can't do this on my own. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3722.4199999999996s)]
*  And so it's kind of where I've, you know, landed, I guess. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3724.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3729.06s)]
*  Well, I think that's the part I struggle with a lot. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3730.58s)]
*  Sometimes it's just on a daily basis, like turning my will over to God, you know, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3732.2599999999998s)]
*  turning my will over to a higher power. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3736.98s)]
*  Like, you know, I pray every day and, but I just, I know that it's a relationship that I want to be [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3739.3799999999997s)]
*  stronger in my life, you know, I can feel it all the time, like me just wanting like a stronger [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3744.98s)]
*  relationship. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3750.42s)]
*  And then, yeah, one thing I liked, one thing I liked about churches was just the sense of community [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3753.14s)]
*  or, you know, religious places people meet up, worship centers, was just the sense of people [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3758.58s)]
*  doing something together, kids being able to do like Sunday school or whatever, and you're going [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3764.1s)]
*  to back and you, you know, you back there, everybody's like making little arts or whatever. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3769.94s)]
*  And I like that, I like that sense of community. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3776.5s)]
*  I think it was good probably for communities to have some shared meeting space. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3779.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think churches and religious worship centers used to be that more in America, you know, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3784.98s)]
*  I don't know what it's like in the rest of the world, but. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3791.7s)]
*  Yeah, I love that community. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3796.18s)]
*  I love, I personally love, like, I look forward to my Sundays and we do like church, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3797.2999999999997s)]
*  well, we do choir practice on Thursdays and like, I definitely feel, I mean, I think because we have [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3803.7s)]
*  a small church, which I think is a good thing, like when people are missing, like they're, you [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3810.3399999999997s)]
*  know, when they go out of town or like they're missed, you know, like I feel like I genuinely [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3816.1s)]
*  miss my church family when I'm in LA or whatever. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3821.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's cool. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3824.42s)]
*  Yes, it's good. I never really had that before. And I'm not that kind of person either. Like I [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3825.46s)]
*  don't like group therapy. I don't like doing, I don't like communal seating at restaurants. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3829.7799999999997s)]
*  Like I like lone wolf, you know, but where I've, you know, I have found my little, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3835.54s)]
*  my little, I guess, tribe, whatever. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3841.62s)]
*  No, that's fair. Well, I think there used to be a lot more that, I mean, there's even that book by [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3844.98s)]
*  Sebastian Younger, I think it's called Tribe, maybe where, yeah, it was about that. It was about [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3849.46s)]
*  when we were in smaller groups and stuff like that. And people used to, yeah, you would miss [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3854.34s)]
*  somebody, they'd be gone. It's like, otherwise you get so caught up with so many things and [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3857.94s)]
*  your space gets too big and it's hard to know. It's hard to pay attention. It's hard to connect, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3862.98s)]
*  you know, or you're trying to connect to too many things, you know, and people feel like [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3867.22s)]
*  that's part of it. We're just trying to connect to too many things. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3871.06s)]
*  I don't think our system is built for that a lot of times. So I think it's nice, I bet having a, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3873.94s)]
*  yeah, a place where you notice if somebody's gone, that's pretty cool. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3879.2200000000003s)]
*  It's important. I think it's important for us. Yeah. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3884.98s)]
*  You know? Yeah, what was it like when you, did you think you really had an addiction problem? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3888.02s)]
*  What was that like? Oh yeah, I mean, I was like a big time [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3893.7000000000003s)]
*  user, drug user? Loser, yeah. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3897.78s)]
*  Loser, yeah, that's fine. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3899.86s)]
*  No, I mean, you know, I'm like a quick learner. So it's not like, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3901.06s)]
*  I'm never casual about anything. So it's like, you know, what starts off as innocent and just [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3906.1800000000003s)]
*  experimentational turns into like my entire existence. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3914.5s)]
*  Yeah, wow. And I, you know, that part of my [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3919.2200000000003s)]
*  personality I've changed, I've managed to change over the years too. Like I've grown up a little [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3922.02s)]
*  bit more, you know? Like what part of it? Well, because I think before when I looked at like my [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3925.54s)]
*  relationships, when I looked at like, just everything has to be in excess, you know? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3929.7s)]
*  And now I'm like a little more balanced. Did you ditch the jacket? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3935.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I just took my jacket off because I don't know if I'm getting warm or not, or I don't know [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3940.4199999999996s)]
*  if I'm just feeling like if something's wrong with me, I feel fine. I'm not going to faint. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3943.7s)]
*  I don't feel like sick. I just, I was like, do I still want to have a jacket on? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3948.2599999999998s)]
*  And so I just took action, I guess, you know? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3954.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think faith is just so interesting. I think it used to be probably a long time ago, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3960.18s)]
*  people had to have more faith because there wasn't, like your television stream was almost [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3964.66s)]
*  like the sky or the, you know, it was like watching nature. Like if you wanted to be [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3969.62s)]
*  watching a channel, you had to go outside. Like you already lived outside, so you got to just look, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3975.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, it was like, I think we're so much more connected probably to the universe. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3980.58s)]
*  And I don't know, I think, I don't know, I just think it's interesting what religion is like. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3985.3799999999997s)]
*  And some people say that it's bad for people, you know, that people call it like the opiate [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3992.02s)]
*  of the masses. You hear people say that. And but I don't know, I would- [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=3996.02s)]
*  I think there's bad representations of everything, you know? I mean, there's like certainly bad [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4001.3799999999997s)]
*  representations of people in AA, you know, like I always had a hard time going to AA because I just [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4007.2999999999997s)]
*  couldn't stand a lot of the people to be honest. And well that, and also like, I just feel like [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4013.78s)]
*  they were never, it was never really anonymous, especially in LA, like people go there as a scene, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4018.1000000000004s)]
*  like you would go and it's like so and so was at a meeting or- [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4021.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4026.5s)]
*  I remember I was going with a friend and then someone like took a picture of us like from, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4026.82s)]
*  you know, the back or whatever and posts like, man, like, you know, it's like my friend's trying [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4031.86s)]
*  to get through something and then, you know, it's like this unnecessary attention or, or the worst [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4036.42s)]
*  would be comedians like that would show up and they would speak and they're just like practicing [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4041.94s)]
*  their- [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4047.46s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4048.1s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it's like the worst, the worst. I'm like- [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4048.9s)]
*  This is why I vape. At least now I have somebody to blame it on. But no, I'll say this, you know [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4053.86s)]
*  what? There is some things about that that make people feel uncomfortable. You know, I try to go [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4059.7000000000003s)]
*  to meetings and share as honestly as I can. And- [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4064.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4067.14s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4068.34s)]
*  But it's sometimes, you know, that part I'm able to get over. Like if somebody hears something I'm [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4069.22s)]
*  thinking or feeling about, because that sometimes could be, was a hang up for me a little bit. Like, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4073.3799999999997s)]
*  you know, if people started to recognize you, it made me feel like scared, I think a lot of times. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4078.58s)]
*  I mean, it all helps and it all doesn't. I mean, you know, I feel like if it, if it, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4084.5s)]
*  if it inspires somebody to keep coming, that's cool too. But you don't want that to, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4087.9399999999996s)]
*  somebody's sobriety hinged on that. But, and I think there's also, it's like, it's like churches. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4092.18s)]
*  There's some that are mega churches that are, you know, preaching weird gospel and like, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4097.7s)]
*  and then there's smaller ones that are, are not, or whatever. You know, I think it's like, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4103.139999999999s)]
*  cause I know there's meetings that are much more private and like, you know, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4107.54s)]
*  you know, it's not a scene or a dating scene or something, you know? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4112.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4115.0599999999995s)]
*  But- [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4115.54s)]
*  Yeah. A is interesting though. I think it's interesting that, yeah, A is interesting. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4115.86s)]
*  But then also you're like, well, this is why I'm here. Sometimes it depends on my attitude. If [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4119.62s)]
*  I'm in a good mood that day, it's like, I don't care. But yeah, one, there was a meeting in Las [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4125.3s)]
*  Vegas recently where a guy was like kind of filming like himself, like with this, with me in the [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4129.7s)]
*  background. And that made me just, I mean, I spoke up for myself and I asked him what was going on, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4134.5s)]
*  but it was just, some of that stuff's a little bit weird. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4139.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's to be, you know, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4142.18s)]
*  But then you're like, well, yeah, I don't know, but I love going to meetings that I really like. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4144.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4151.7s)]
*  I thought it was super helpful. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4152.18s)]
*  That's good. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4153.46s)]
*  I was trying to think of something else with fate that we could talk about. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4156.18s)]
*  You want to talk about that stuff more? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4159.46s)]
*  Is it okay with you? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4161.06s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4161.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, I love thinking about it. I don't have a lot of people on that are, that I guess, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4162.820000000001s)]
*  that we talk about it with as much. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4167.38s)]
*  I'm probably the worst person because I'm not like a studied, you know- [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4168.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, I don't know anything about like the history of it. I mean, I know that the, you know, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4171.9400000000005s)]
*  I know about the family in the woods. I know they had the apple. I know one of the sons killed the [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4175.7s)]
*  other one. So things got a little hectic right out of the gate, you know, but there's a lot of [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4181.38s)]
*  like this, I don't know a lot of the logistics, you know? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4186.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4189.86s)]
*  So I think I wouldn't, yeah, that part I don't know about. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4190.5s)]
*  But I just think about feelings and stuff. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4194.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4196.42s)]
*  I like thinking about that kind of stuff. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4196.900000000001s)]
*  Some of that is intuitive too, I feel like, you know, like, like there's parts of, you know, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4198.58s)]
*  I think there's like some things that are like ingrained in us that you can't really explain, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4204.179999999999s)]
*  you know? Like it doesn't feel good to harm somebody, things like that, you know? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4213.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4217.62s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4219.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but then, yeah, it's interesting how that kind of stuff happens in the world sometimes, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4221.62s)]
*  you know? I don't know. I don't- [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4225.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I think then people go, well, you know, if- [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4226.98s)]
*  Why would God let that happen? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4228.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4230.259999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's what God- [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4230.419999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna take my shoes off. Is that okay? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4231.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. That's fine. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4232.98s)]
*  Don't get a shot of it because that's gross. I hate people do that. I just want to do this. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4234.099999999999s)]
*  I won't. I don't even have my phone on me. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4236.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4238.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, but yeah, we can blur them out. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4238.74s)]
*  No, you don't have to blur them out. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4240.74s)]
*  Yeah, but I think sometimes people want to blame God when it's bad and not for the good stuff. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4244.98s)]
*  But I think you look at like, I always think like we're human, you know, we sin, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4250.259999999999s)]
*  we are capable of making mistakes and we have free will to make, you know, good and bad choices. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4256.66s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, of course there's going to be evil in this world, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4262.18s)]
*  but I don't think God would be the one to blame, you know. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4265.62s)]
*  You still have to take accountability for your actions, you know. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4269.860000000001s)]
*  It's a shame that bad things do happen to a lot of good people and innocent people. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4274.02s)]
*  That's the way of the world, you know. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4278.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's always been there throughout time, you know. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4280.900000000001s)]
*  I don't think God of God is like a specific instance to instance type of [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4283.3s)]
*  like landlord or whatever you want to, you know, leader, you know, or champion or whatever. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4288.740000000001s)]
*  Some people call him different names, but I think of him more as just this jet of like, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4294.42s)]
*  I think of like of, I like to think of his view of us as like a general energy, more like, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4300.34s)]
*  it's just something that's always there, no matter if even if things are horrible, it's there. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4307.540000000001s)]
*  And if things are good, it's there, you know. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4313.38s)]
*  Um, it's almost like this, like, uh, it's like this code or something that kind of fits to [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4315.94s)]
*  whatever you need it to be. I don't really think of it as like a low, like too much of like a [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4324.98s)]
*  rigid thing. So yeah, I guess I wouldn't blame God. Like if something horrible happened, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4331.7s)]
*  I don't know if I would take it to God. I would just be like, that's what we do here, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4335.14s)]
*  unfortunately in the world, you know, I might talk to God to try and have understanding [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4340.58s)]
*  and maybe I would blame him and he would let me blame him. You know, that's one of the things [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4347.54s)]
*  he does. He just lets you blame him. You know, that I don't know. I don't know. I like thinking [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4351.46s)]
*  about this though. Some of it's interesting, you know, because it's like, yeah, how do we, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4355.94s)]
*  and we all know if our brains can conceptualize everything, like we're only, we only have five [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4360.5s)]
*  senses, you know, I was just talking to my buddy about this the other day, like, dude, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4364.9s)]
*  we only have five senses. Yeah. Not that many, dude. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4367.94s)]
*  A lot can be done with that though. A lot can be done with that. No, no, and look, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4373.62s)]
*  people are doing a great job. Yeah. I feel like there's like parts of my brain that can't [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4377.299999999999s)]
*  comprehend the concepts of time, you know what I mean? But we just try our best to get through [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4382.419999999999s)]
*  that. Like I think about like the story of Job in the Bible. Like that one is, you know, even if [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4388.5s)]
*  you look at it, you know, not literally, but like where like Job was this guy, and I'm going to just [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4393.54s)]
*  paraphrase it. I totally paraphrase. And look, if anybody judges me for paraphrasing out of the [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4399.06s)]
*  Bible, dude, we're not pastors, you know? Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah. We're just two people sitting [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4402.98s)]
*  somewhere trying our best to be alive in the universe. Yeah, yeah, it's true. But thanks. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4407.62s)]
*  But you know, like Job was put through all these trials and all of the worst things that you can [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4413.06s)]
*  imagine happening to one person. And through it, he just maintained his faith. And even at a point [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4418.34s)]
*  where even at one point, his wife was like, come on, are you serious? Like, how can you still like, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4424.58s)]
*  praise God when you're, you know, you're losing your children, you're losing everything we've had, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4428.5s)]
*  you know, and now you're sick and covered in boils and on the brink of death, you know? And he was [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4433.14s)]
*  just like, praise God, you know? And I feel like a lot of times, you know, through my decades of [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4438.26s)]
*  tattooing people and hearing like the worst and saddest stories, like, just, you know, I was kind [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4444.9s)]
*  of known for doing a lot of portraits. And so I would do portraits of people, their loved ones who [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4450.179999999999s)]
*  have passed or, you know, their loved ones who inspired them, things like that. And you just hear [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4455.7s)]
*  some of the most heart wrenching stuff that like, I can't even begin to imagine like how you're still [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4459.86s)]
*  walking, you know? But they still find a way, you know? And I feel like that's like, I want to be [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4464.5s)]
*  like Job in that sense, you know? Because like this, like the last few years for me, I've been [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4471.14s)]
*  so rough, like behind the curtains, you know? I don't share all of my, I'm not the type of person [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4475.54s)]
*  that goes on Instagram and cries, you know? But it's like, you know, we suffer quietly through [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4481.06s)]
*  things and we like, you know, no one has a perfect life. But I'm still going to live in a state of [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4486.1s)]
*  gratitude, you know? And I'm still going to be like, excited to be here sitting with you today, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4494.34s)]
*  and it's like, the world could be falling apart and I'm still like, praise God, you know? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4498.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it gives you hope, I think. That's the thing I think, that's, I don't know, I mean, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4502.900000000001s)]
*  yeah, I love that. Yeah, and we do all suffer, it is interesting how we suffer quietly, huh? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4509.38s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, some suffer loudly like a dick, but- [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4514.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, like my freaking neighbor's dog. I think he's not even suffering, but it's loud. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4518.18s)]
*  But it's all going to be okay. Yeah, I think that's what God is to a lot of people. It's a [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4528.58s)]
*  real, it's like, I would way rather have hope. Me too. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4533.22s)]
*  Than not have it. Yeah. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4541.22s)]
*  That's the thing, it's like, and yeah, I don't know, I've just felt God, I've just felt God, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4543.860000000001s)]
*  like- Same. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4549.54s)]
*  I didn't say, it was the only thing I could say it was. Yeah. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4550.42s)]
*  You know, because one time I was smoking a bunch of menthols actually going back to cigarettes, but [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4553.06s)]
*  my girlfriend had broken up with me and I was about to just, you know, peel my skin off of my [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4557.22s)]
*  body and feed it to something and I wasn't doing real well. And I was just really doing real bad, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4562.740000000001s)]
*  just on the inside. I was just, and I just, I mean, I swear, it's crazy, but I felt like something [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4568.5s)]
*  literally just like put like a big hand went around my heart and I started to feel better. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4574.5s)]
*  But I felt like a, it really felt like that, which is- [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4581.54s)]
*  Yeah. I had the exact same feeling. Really? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4585.7s)]
*  Yeah. It was weird. And I don't really talk about it because then you sound all like- [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4588.34s)]
*  I want to give a fuck. People know I'm bad. You know, we're doing our best. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4592.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4595.54s)]
*  If anybody thinks, yeah, that they think I know anything about God, like any exact low key BTS [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4596.0199999999995s)]
*  information about the Lord, they're out of their effing mind. And if they think they do too, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4601.7s)]
*  then they're out of their effing mind. I just am trying to think out loud and feel out loud with [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4605.46s)]
*  somebody. Yeah. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4610.34s)]
*  Is that what that, but you had something similar? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4611.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Where I felt like a hand, like just kind of wrapping me in warmth. And I just had [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4613.3s)]
*  this feeling of surrendering to it, you know, where I was just like, oh man, like it's going [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4623.78s)]
*  to be fine. And it's not, it's not me just being like, oh, I'll tell myself until, you know, like, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4629.860000000001s)]
*  no, like I had like a clear understanding that like you got me, you know? It was kind of cool. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4634.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And well, what's interesting too for me is that I've even taken my own will back so [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4640.259999999999s)]
*  many times since then. And that's the tough thing. I think that's where I want to get more into like [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4645.7s)]
*  just my morning routine is just like turning my, just die will be done, you know? Cause then it [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4650.0199999999995s)]
*  just takes all the pressure off of me. It takes all the pressure off of me to like feel like I have [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4654.98s)]
*  to make everything okay or that I got to make everybody okay or that I have. What are those [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4659.219999999999s)]
*  pressures like? I don't know. I think I just feel, I've always felt like I'm running late for [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4664.82s)]
*  something. I've felt that my whole life. Like I'm, if I don't keep doing more, then I'm not enough. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4674.9s)]
*  Or like if I don't do, I think I've, I felt as a kid, like if I don't do something, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4687.0599999999995s)]
*  then like I just wasn't seen. My mother, my mother didn't really look at me. Right. And so [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4691.46s)]
*  I think I felt like I have to be perfect. If I'm not, the only way I have a chance of being seen [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4697.06s)]
*  is if I'm perfect, you know? And if I'm not, if I'm not like perfect, then I just don't have a [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4706.5s)]
*  chance to be seen, you know? And yeah, it makes me, it makes me sad to think that a kid would [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4713.3s)]
*  think that, you know? But I think that's how I felt. You know, I think, and I'm not blaming [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4719.3s)]
*  my mother. I think, or my father, you know, I don't know. I don't know what their lives were like, but [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4724.820000000001s)]
*  yeah, I just remember like, as I've gotten older, I've been able to recognize that. Like, man, if [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4729.06s)]
*  I just, that's what you were feeling for so long, you know, I felt like I always needed to go do [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4734.02s)]
*  something to try and make myself better so that I was enough. Same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To be seen, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4738.900000000001s)]
*  you know? Yeah. So I think when I say, yeah, that will be done. It's like just letting like, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4744.66s)]
*  none of that, Matt, it does, everything's okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4754.26s)]
*  no matter how you are, if you're good or bad, or if you're not doing your best, if you're not even [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4759.46s)]
*  like, not if you're not even trying really, I feel like you should try. Yeah. But just that [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4764.5s)]
*  everything is, you're just not alone, you know? Yeah. And so I think I've always had a tough time [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4771.3s)]
*  like letting people love me, you know? Really? Yeah. It's been really, really tough. Like in [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4778.58s)]
*  relationships or something? Yeah. I think I'm just, I think that muscle just wasn't built up when I [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4782.74s)]
*  was a child with my mother. And so I just didn't, I just have had a tough time with it. And so [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4787.62s)]
*  I think the interesting thing about having, or through 12 step for me has just been having [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4794.820000000001s)]
*  trying to build some relationship. It's the first time that I've kind of really let somebody into [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4801.700000000001s)]
*  my life is in my negotiations with God. Yeah. And I hate to call them that, but that's kind of, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4806.820000000001s)]
*  you know? That makes sense though. Like how much am I willing to turn myself over to that somebody [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4813.9400000000005s)]
*  else is going to, that somebody else is going to be with me, you know? Even if I'm not, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4819.22s)]
*  uh, even if I'm not enough, or if I don't feel like I'm enough for them to, uh, keep me around, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4828.1s)]
*  you know? Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I know it's a lot of stuff, but yeah, I think I, yeah. I had [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4834.9s)]
*  this, uh, this, um, scenario this, this, uh, last week when I was in LA actually, um, where, uh, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4841.3s)]
*  you know, I had this makeup line for 12 years and it did really great. And then at one point [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4851.78s)]
*  I got a bunch of backlash and, um, and I ended up having to like, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4858.259999999999s)]
*  really like sit with myself and figure out like what I want to do with my life. If I want to keep [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4866.099999999999s)]
*  up this fight of, um, like, I mean, I don't know, there's like contractually things that, that, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4870.58s)]
*  that I can't talk about anymore, but, but when I sold my makeup line, um, I had to sit there [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4879.3s)]
*  in, um, in a meeting with the production company and, um, and lawyers and stuff. And [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4885.94s)]
*  I remember I just wanted to like, shut it down. Like, let's just let it go. Like, I don't want [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4893.219999999999s)]
*  to do this anymore, you know? And they were like, but I think they, they saw there's profits to be [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4897.3s)]
*  made and stuff. And so, um, in order to buy me out, like, you know, there was negotiations. And [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4901.78s)]
*  at one point, and I was always very fair about things. I don't, I wasn't asking for, you know, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4907.78s)]
*  the world. And, uh, and I remember at one point, um, uh, this guy, this old man with like this [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4913.7s)]
*  balding old man with a, a potato nose, alcoholic potato nose, like, looked me in the eyes and told [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4923.94s)]
*  me, you're not worth anything anymore. Like, and, um, and those words and his voice, like hot me [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4931.54s)]
*  still, even though I know it's not like this guy's telling me what's cool. Like, you know? And, um, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4939.3s)]
*  and I know it was just like a leveraging point to whatever, try to give me as little as possible, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4944.74s)]
*  but so I, uh, when I go to LA, I like, this is one thing that I don't, that I, that I do complain [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4950.66s)]
*  about where I'm at in Indiana is that there's no places to work out. And I actually like, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4956.82s)]
*  it's good for my health to work out every day. So when I go to LA, I'll fly in and then I just go to, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4960.98s)]
*  I go to Barry's bootcamp where I just have a bunch of people yelling at me to run faster. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4966.1s)]
*  And, uh, and so, but if you've ever been to like a Barry's workout, it's like, there's no, uh, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4970.18s)]
*  talking. And that's another thing I like about it. You just go, you work out and then in between, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4975.86s)]
*  um, like you do like floor work and then you have to switch to the treadmill, right? And in between [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4980.58s)]
*  that you, you switch. And so we're right about to switch and I'm just sitting there like, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4984.42s)]
*  this guy's voice gets in my head. I'm looking at myself in the mirror and it's just like, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4989.54s)]
*  like, uh, you're not worth anything anymore. And, uh, I'm like, what am I doing my life? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4994.179999999999s)]
*  And I was like on the verge of tears and right at that moment, this like blonde girl [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=4998.099999999999s)]
*  just comes up to me and was like, Hey Kat, really quick. I just want to tell you, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5002.98s)]
*  I think you're so amazing. And I just like lost it. Like, and then she just went on her treadmill [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5008.099999999999s)]
*  and like, you know, didn't see her again. And I was like, man, I know it's not, um, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5013.62s)]
*  this is the part where you should blame God for like these beautiful divine like moments where [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5018.34s)]
*  it's like, man, you sent this girl like to me just to say like a few little words that like [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5022.98s)]
*  just changed my, you know, I was just like, so grateful in that moment. I like went back home [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5028.74s)]
*  after that workout. I just went to my husband. I was like, this girl just changed my life, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5034.099999999999s)]
*  you know? And he was just like, yeah, why are you even listening to that? I'm like, I know. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5038.0199999999995s)]
*  And that was like years ago. And I just still like, you know, I don't know what part of me, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5040.58s)]
*  and it's probably my childhood stuff where, you know, I don't know yours, but mine was like [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5045.86s)]
*  constantly seeking validation through, through my mom, you know, like that wasn't there. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5051.46s)]
*  And it's like, um, and you know, I've gone to like years of therapy to like [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5056.5s)]
*  fix myself and stuff. So I'm not where I was before, but before I was like, definitely like, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5060.66s)]
*  oh yeah, like I need to do more. There's not enough, like I, there's so much I want to do [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5066.5s)]
*  that it hurts. And it's just like, and it's not, it doesn't really matter if you have like a sea [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5071.14s)]
*  of people that are like cheering you on at the end of the day. It's like, it's just all in here, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5075.38s)]
*  you know? But, um, yeah, it's just, it's crazy to see it in real time. Now I feel like ever since I [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5080.42s)]
*  got to this place that I am now, like with, with my faith, like I start seeing it in real time, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5088.42s)]
*  all the time where it's like, God's just kind of diving in and being like, cut that shit out. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5093.54s)]
*  Like, you know, um, but I don't think it's ever going to go away though. Yeah. Yeah. And that [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5098.0199999999995s)]
*  childhood stuff and all that kind of like, I don't suffer from that stuff every day. No, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5105.7s)]
*  it just creeps in sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes people see, you know, they're like, man, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5110.34s)]
*  you seem like, you know, I'm like, I'm, I'm okay. Yeah. You know, but it's still a part of me [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5113.38s)]
*  that lives inside of me, you know? And, um, and sometimes there's still like, I noticed there's [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5119.22s)]
*  a lot of feelings. Like I never got to have feelings when I was a kid. I didn't know. I was [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5124.5s)]
*  always in some type of mode of like, I need to be like seen. I need to make sure my mother sees me [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5128.26s)]
*  so I'll be fat, just taking care, you know, whatever. So I, so at that point you're not [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5135.06s)]
*  developing any other feelings except for like, you know, yeah, like a stress. Yes. And so I think, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5140.02s)]
*  yeah, but I think the first time I've ever really been able to have some sort of a even [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5146.58s)]
*  discussion of a relationship in my life has been, um, through recovery and through, uh, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5152.34s)]
*  the introduction of God that way. Cause it was like, you get to choose your own God. Right. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5158.5s)]
*  And I, I've just chosen the most common God that I know. And, and, um, the one that I, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5162.66s)]
*  you know, friends, families would take me to church and stuff. And so, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5167.22s)]
*  and that's fine for me, you know, it's, um, but I think a lot of that's interesting. Yeah, man, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5170.82s)]
*  I can't believe what gets me is that somebody would even want to work in a job where debating [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5175.86s)]
*  or negotiating for money is worth even the value of saying something to someone. Yeah. That's the [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5181.62s)]
*  sickest part of the world. I mean, it worked. I've definitely was like questioning myself [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5189.86s)]
*  in that moment and it was like, maybe I should just settle, you know? And it's like, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5196.179999999999s)]
*  you know, but lesson lessons learned. I don't, I think everything turned out the way it was [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5200.26s)]
*  supposed to anyway. Yeah. You know, but that's a lot of LA. It's like, you almost have to hire [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5205.860000000001s)]
*  sick people to deal with other sick people and some of that. And it's like, you know, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5210.820000000001s)]
*  but that's the nicest thing about being out of there. I think is having some semblance of, uh, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5217.3s)]
*  like, I don't have a manager. I don't have, I don't know. I've simplified my life too. It's crazy. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5222.34s)]
*  And a lot of these things have just, cause you know, I've been so used to being in this little [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5227.219999999999s)]
*  bubble where it's like, uh, having the assistance and the managers and all this stuff. And then it's [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5233.0599999999995s)]
*  like, we move out here and I was like, I can't really, I don't want to bring a compound of people [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5237.459999999999s)]
*  over here. And you know, we had a nanny, for example, like, um, and, and, you know, I w I [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5241.62s)]
*  wasn't blessed with a very close family. So when, when I had my son, it's not like I had a village [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5248.179999999999s)]
*  of family that was helping us out. Like it was just me and my husband by ourselves. And, um, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5254.0199999999995s)]
*  and it's fine. You know, we can do it, but then I ended up hiring a nanny who was like family to [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5258.5s)]
*  us, you know, and she would just come from nine to five so that I could do all my work during the [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5265.0599999999995s)]
*  day. And then, and then once we moved out here, it was like, um, I was kind of like left alone. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5268.82s)]
*  And I was like, man, this is actually cool being, um, a full-time mom. I know it sounds so dumb to [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5273.7s)]
*  say that out loud, but like where I'm, it's just me 100% of the time, instead of, um, having [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5280.1s)]
*  somebody help. And, uh, I think it's made me obviously a better mom. And, um, and, but, but [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5285.38s)]
*  you, you realize like with, with less is sometimes easier. Um, it's definitely less complicated, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5292.42s)]
*  you know, like my life is definitely like, I, I let go of publicists and all that stuff. I mean, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5299.780000000001s)]
*  we will definitely hire, like when we, when I have an album launch and stuff, I'll put together a [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5305.06s)]
*  team and we do things, but in general, like I'm not dealing with a sea of people anymore. And it [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5308.58s)]
*  is, it is definitely liberating and it feels like just, um, I, there's just more benefits to it. I [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5313.7s)]
*  think, like even when you guys hit me up and stuff, it's like, I used to be like, oh yeah, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5320.26s)]
*  I'll just let so and so hand out. I'm like, that's cool. I'll just drive myself here, you know, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5324.34s)]
*  like, um, cause Southern Indiana is not that far from here. And I'm like my son and my husband, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5328.18s)]
*  we took a little road trip, you know? Oh, nice. Yeah. And then it's just like, like it's just [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5333.54s)]
*  easier that way. Yeah. Oh yeah. And these days it's like, I don't want somebody fielding something [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5337.86s)]
*  that does, has no idea what my interests are or what, who I, or what, you know, they may have some [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5344.98s)]
*  idea of what my interests are, but they don't, they're not going to make the choices. I, you know, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5350.42s)]
*  it's almost like a lot of that whole world is built on this shell system that you need somebody [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5355.219999999999s)]
*  to help you be a human, you know? Um, but these days, a lot of like, people don't even believe [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5360.179999999999s)]
*  a lot of stuff in the press. Nobody takes it. I don't believe any of it. It's all, it's all a [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5366.66s)]
*  bunch of fucking, uh, SoundCloud, right? You know, it's all like a lot of fucking. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5371.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, if anything, usually if I see like certain headlines, especially with my friends, I'm like, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5379.0599999999995s)]
*  well, you already know the, the, the truth behind things. And I'm like, oh, like I, I'll be more, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5383.46s)]
*  like my first thought is to be like, oh, it's probably the opposite of whatever it is out there [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5389.3s)]
*  because, but I feel like do people still fall for it now? Probably. I don't know. I, if, look, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5393.54s)]
*  if you still fall, if you don't think that, I mean, there's just so, like I have friends, it's like, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5398.0199999999995s)]
*  uh, who was my friend the other day was telling me that there's some celebrity that they pay a [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5404.5s)]
*  couple of grand or something. And then some, the people show up and take pictures of them and then [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5409.86s)]
*  it's going to be in some tabloids, but it's all set up and none of it's like, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5414.18s)]
*  it's all for show. None of it, it's not real. You know, it's like, and it's like, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5418.18s)]
*  people will come out with a brand and then they'll call their friend in a magazine and they're like, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5425.38s)]
*  Hey, can you say that this brand is amazing? And then their friend writes an article says the [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5428.9s)]
*  brand is amazing. And we don't even know if the brain, it's just like, so much of it is, um, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5431.94s)]
*  it's just, uh, valueless because it's not true. Yeah. You know, and I think that's the thing is [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5438.5s)]
*  just trying to sort out what's true. And I think that's what we're all trying to do. I think a lot [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5446.1s)]
*  of times just in our own lives even is like, well, what do I really think or feel what's true? You [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5450.660000000001s)]
*  know, I think that's something I've had an interesting time. Um, so, I mean, I, I mean, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5456.9800000000005s)]
*  that's, I think that's one of the reasons I've always loved you and everything you do is like, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5462.42s)]
*  there's a level of authenticity. Um, and it's like, like earlier we were talking about style [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5466.58s)]
*  and stuff and I'm like, I love your style. Cause it's, it's just you're effortlessly doing it, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5471.54s)]
*  whatever you like, you know, or unless there's a lot of effort, I don't know. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5476.26s)]
*  I mean, it took a while to stay in there and be like, I don't know if this is okay, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5479.94s)]
*  but I'm going to wear that black coat. Cause I know you like black stuff. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5484.42s)]
*  I love that. I wish I could be as brave as you. I think I did think that's the reddest lipstick [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5489.14s)]
*  I've ever seen in my life, but it's kind of a nice Christmas color too. Wait, what do you mean? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5493.7s)]
*  Brave? I think it's just brave to like, to be like, uh, like, cause I remember when I was in [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5497.06s)]
*  junior high school, my friend, Matt Scheneverer, he was like, he was a neat guy and his brother [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5506.5s)]
*  played in a band and I don't want to say the band was bad, but the band was probably had a unique [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5511.22s)]
*  sound. Okay. Okay. So, and their name was like, uh, you know, like, uh, shuddering, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5516.9s)]
*  like it was something crazy, you know, like desperate victim or something, you know, like [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5525.94s)]
*  definitely like the name of the band was one guy was playing the drums, but he was, he was just [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5531.219999999999s)]
*  fucking shaking with anger so much and he had the sticks in his hand and he was just keeping some [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5537.86s)]
*  type of a vague wooden metal falsetto and it was just that's who they were, you know, but so I would [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5543.38s)]
*  go sometimes and try to be like, and I would listen to like blind melon and like fucking. Blind melon [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5550.18s)]
*  is like the one that. But they somehow rolled, I guess they weren't goth, but they were kind of [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5555.86s)]
*  hippie. I don't know if we had goth, maybe we had one dude. Oh yeah. Goth was different. Sorry. These [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5565.14s)]
*  were just kind of like, like violent hippies. Okay. All right. So that's kind of the group I was in [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5570.18s)]
*  for a little while was this violent hippie group. And then, um, but yeah, the goth kids would wear [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5578.5s)]
*  like those shoes that were like, and then, but they had to wait till everybody left to walk back [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5582.66s)]
*  because it was like such a uncomfortable walk sometimes. She's like, why are those goth kids [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5588.66s)]
*  still hanging out by the tree over there? Like always in the trees. It's weird. There's even a [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5593.22s)]
*  website. I think it was called Goths in Trees. And for some, there's like a fascination with like [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5597.94s)]
*  goth people that are like in trees. I didn't, I've never felt the feeling calling, but I don't know. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5603.379999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of them. That's cool. It's a thing. So go on. There it is. Goths in Trees. Right there. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5610.259999999999s)]
*  Let's look at a few of them. They all hang out. That guy's not that goth. Yeah, that guy definitely. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5614.9s)]
*  Oh, that guy is goth dude. Yeah. They all hang out in trees. I don't understand. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5619.0599999999995s)]
*  Ooh, there's something very Edgar Allan Poe about it. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5624.900000000001s)]
*  You know, because they're, because of a raven. I think so. Now this lady seems like, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5629.700000000001s)]
*  it's a thing. I've never done it. Let's see more. This is fascinating. Wow. That guy is goth. Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5636.02s)]
*  Look at their inside trees. It's weird. I wonder if there's something about it that feels good to them. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5642.26s)]
*  To our species. Yeah, I could see it. Now this is really interesting. She brought props. Oh yeah, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5648.099999999999s)]
*  she's a Sith. Or scythe? Is it scythe? She's a scythe. Oh wow. Yeah. These are goths on trees. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5658.099999999999s)]
*  Is it a tree house or? Yeah, it looks like a tree house or a zipline. Goths on zipline would be good too. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5667.139999999999s)]
*  But I love this. This is really fascinating. I used to love when there was some dope Tumblr pages out there. That was fun, wasn't it? Yeah. But you were going to get to the point where, so you had the friends that were in the band and- Yeah, but yeah, and I thought I was goth, but I wasn't. I guess, yeah, we would just like listen to like Skinny Puppy or different bands like, you know, Epilepsy Lizard or some kind of shit like that. And then, yeah, that was it. That was about as goth, as kind of as goth as we were. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5672.66s)]
*  I was always marveled at the people that could go full dark winged duck, you know, like people that- I like that, dark winged duck. Yeah, I think the people that like could be like, whoa, like this person, like how did they get to school? Did they flew here themselves? Like that type of- I think there was something like interesting about it. Yeah. Yeah, and there was always like, there's such an allure I think about that sort of woman or, yeah, I would probably say woman more, but- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5702.66s)]
*  Because I think it's like, there's something interesting about a goth person. What is it? What is it about goth people? Why is it like a, like the loose screws probably? What is it? Like, why do they, what is it like the, the calling towards like, is there like a code of conduct or something? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5732.66s)]
*  I mean, there's got to be some childhood stuff, right? I mean, I know for me, I, I, like I said, I never felt a sense of belonging even within my own family unit. So I remember discovering music and then not necessarily seeing myself, but like, there was a reflection of emotions happening. Like when I, like, I love the cure and Susan, the banshees, the Peshmer, and I think like lyrically and just like this, the soul to it, you know, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5751.5s)]
*  I feel like a lot of people are sensitive in that sense, but, and then they just like take it to the, you know, to the outward expression of that. But I don't know. I just, I just like it. You know, I, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5781.5s)]
*  Maybe that's it. Maybe like a way to be seen too. Cause I guess it was an outlier. Like I grew up in a small town. So, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5795.54s)]
*  But it's kind of not. Cause like, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5801.9s)]
*  Right. Cause you have your own group then. Like, is that what you mean? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5803.58s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. I, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5807.34s)]
*  I'm not judging. I'm just looking at it. I'm like, it's just interesting. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5808.62s)]
*  I mean, like even this morning when I was getting ready, I was like, you know, I feel like I tend to dress very, I cover all the time. Like, I don't, I very rarely show my tattoos at all. I was like, you know, I'm going to change it up. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5810.98s)]
*  I'm going to go see Theo today and I'll just wear short sleeves, you know, but I feel like I would always get tattooed for myself. Like, I just like to look at images or I like what it looks like with the appearance of it. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5822.86s)]
*  I, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5835.54s)]
*  In the middle of nowhere in Indiana, like I dress like this every day. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5836.82s)]
*  And it's like, but it's not for anybody else other than, why are you laughing? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5841.82s)]
*  I get to see how many men got like pulled up back at home and like, honey, I seen a damn apparition down there. Damn this neighborhood is going to shit. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5845.82s)]
*  So, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5856.66s)]
*  You think? Really? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5857.98s)]
*  I think there's something interesting about, or no, there's some, I look, I think a lot of men, I remember in our town, a lot of men would go and cry over by the Winn-Dixie and their truck. I remember. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5860.86s)]
*  Why? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5868.74s)]
*  I don't know why, but we would go ride our bike over there sometimes. It was like a sad place. Like I think men would just go sit over there and be sad sometimes. I remember seeing that. But, yeah, I think there was something very alluring about a goth woman to me. It seemed like a siren, you know, like in that book? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5869.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5885.74s)]
*  For Odysseus? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5886.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5887.14s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5887.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5887.820000000001s)]
*  It seemed, that's what it seemed like. There was like something like, what's going on? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5888.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5893.9400000000005s)]
*  This is different. It's different. You know, I think it's, well, it's brave to be different. I think so that may be like, yeah, was an element of like, this feels brave to me. Like, I'm just interested how somebody kind of leans into that or how they, you know, not that they're joining a group, but it's like, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5894.820000000001s)]
*  what, how does that kind of, yeah, why does, why does one goth, you know? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5915.82s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I just like what I like, I think. And I just do more of that or do a lot of that, I guess. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5922.06s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. I've never gotten, you know, I think there's maybe I might've dated a goth woman at some point. I don't remember, but I probably, I think I could have. I think I did. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5930.58s)]
*  She didn't write you a poem? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5941.42s)]
*  Uh huh. I'm sure she did. I'm sure. Dude, I was in the French quarter the other day with my brother and there's people there. If you go up to them, they'll write a poem for you and your friend. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5942.62s)]
*  About you? Is it funny or is it like a? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5952.78s)]
*  No, it was like a nice poem. They're like, okay, tell us a little bit about yourself. And I was like, oh, this is my brother. And, you know, and so you tell them a couple little things, you know, and then you have to stay in there for about 11 minutes. That's the tough part. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5954.82s)]
*  You know, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5966.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5967.9s)]
*  And they're all sitting there sitting there on typewriters, like a row, like four of them and everybody's just like, and there's like music playing, like people are playing the street music and it was pretty awesome. We had a great time. And yeah, we got a nice little Christmas gift there. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5969.0199999999995s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5979.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was real nice. But yeah, they, yeah, I was, oh, I was in a class with this lady and she was, she smoked a lot of weed like her. Some of her, I think she had discolored teeth from them. But she was awesome. She was like the stoner teacher kind of or a ledge stoner. And we would write poems in there all day. So I think that's maybe where I saw some goth. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=5980.740000000001s)]
*  Her teeth, they were yellow. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6000.5s)]
*  I think that a tint to them. I don't want to. Yeah, I don't want to call it. You know, I don't know. She could have had a [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6003.18s)]
*  I'm so self conscious about my teeth lately. I feel like in pictures because I wear lipstick all the time. No, I feel like I'm looking at yours. Yours are super white. Mine are not white. And I was like, I even googled like why because I brush and floss like crazy and I quit smoking. So I thought, oh, I'm going to get white teeth. It's gonna be amazing. And then I just, it's just not happening. I don't know what to do about it. I don't want to get I won't get the fake teeth that everyone's [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6007.7s)]
*  getting now. It's great. Everyone looks crazy. Hey, brother. They look so crazy. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6030.38s)]
*  I'm like, damn, what have you been eating buddy electricity? Huh? What have you been eating, dude? You got gloss finished teeth. What's crazy is if your teeth look very nice. I would have nice teeth. Your teeth are whiter than your skin. No, your teeth are so white. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6036.86s)]
*  No, uh, yeah, huh. Oh, I guarantee you that. But this is like, everybody watches like these people have the yellow is fucking these idiots. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6052.7s)]
*  I just will I'll live with my yellow if it means not having like, chiclet teeth. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6065.38s)]
*  Oh, my mom was always brushing her teeth and putting on hand cream. Yeah. Oh, our house could be burning down. But as long as she was getting her hand cream on. Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty cool, though, actually. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6071.94s)]
*  I think, yeah, it was just, you know, she'd always had that hand cream. I think it's probably calming to her to maybe to be doing to kind of do this with our hands. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6082.5s)]
*  I wonder what my son's going to take away from like, that's your one of your little core memories. And I'm like, I wonder what Oh, what his will be. Yeah. Oh, because he's so sweet. He learned the word ravishing. Now he's like this morning, Mom, you look ravishing. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6092.14s)]
*  I'm like, thanks. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6107.98s)]
*  You like go get in that tree for family pictures. Actually, no, dude, that would be a neat idea. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6110.98s)]
*  We do. We do. We get we do a lot of family portraits together. And I like I love our little family because we just we look like a little family, you know, like my son. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6115.86s)]
*  He is not scared about like what I think. I'm not scared. But like spooky to him is fun because it's what he's around. You know, I mean, his normal is a lot different than like normal kids. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6127.3s)]
*  And we get a lot of criticism about that, too, because, you know, because he wears black or he'll like I'm like, that's what he likes. Like at this point, he sees his dad or his mom. You know, it's like it's normal to him. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6138.3s)]
*  So we did like a photo shoot for this. It was actually for like an interview, like for a magazine thing. And they wanted to shoot us in front of our house. And so I was like, oh, there's like this little fountain. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6151.78s)]
*  And I had like my little like Tim Burton, like parasol thing. And and people just hated it. I think they just hated seeing like it bothers them that we we don't look normal. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6161.259999999999s)]
*  It's really weird. I would think you would think like, oh, that's cute. It's very like Adam's family or something, you know. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6173.78s)]
*  Well, even like we're seeing earlier, people want to put and I'll die. Do it, too. I want to have a box. I want to have a safe space for things to be. And I don't want things to I'm OK with the edges fraying. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6179.46s)]
*  But I think there's a part of me even like a system of organization, I think. Yeah, because your brain just all your brain does is just organizers. Yeah, that's true. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6191.94s)]
*  So I think when things start to get a little weary, they don't know, you know, you don't know what to get. What's going on? Yeah. What? What's your husband like? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6200.46s)]
*  He's cool. He's a. His name is Rafael and my son's name is Leofar, which is Rafael spelled backwards. Yeah, it's pretty. Wow. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6208.5s)]
*  I know. I wish I had a cool name that sounded good backwards. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, but it's cool. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6217.139999999999s)]
*  You don't. I don't read it. I know. Sorry. Sorry. But yeah, yeah, you know, but that but yeah, it's very you should get your son a vulture or something for Christmas. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6223.379999999999s)]
*  I bet. Anyway, sorry. Yeah, sorry. You're making so many jokes. I love it. I love your aesthetic and stuff. Yeah, but it's cool. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6238.0599999999995s)]
*  I never I'm very accurate, though. Well, I wish I got to talk to more people that are like our goth people. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6245.54s)]
*  I think I think I don't ever do. I don't know if I don't go to enough goth places. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6250.82s)]
*  I think I've always kind of had a affinity for goth women, maybe I think. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6254.78s)]
*  Oh, my brother likes goth women, too, I think. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6259.299999999999s)]
*  Or he likes creative ladies. Yeah. Like artsy. Yeah. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6262.179999999999s)]
*  And yeah, I think where I was growing up being artsy was weird. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6265.46s)]
*  You know, I think it was like people thought you was gay or something, you know, or you was gay or whatever. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6268.22s)]
*  If you, you know, did like I remember if you got good grades, you know, people thought you were homosexual. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6274.42s)]
*  Really? Oh, yeah, dude. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6279.3s)]
*  And so it was like, yeah. So I think being brave enough, probably. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6281.22s)]
*  Yeah. And when I was little to have somebody be like unique. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6286.0199999999995s)]

*  And so I'm in the process. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6874.58s)]
*  I have like almost 80 percent of my body done now. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6875.82s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6878.5s)]
*  But it's not going to look like a like I'm wearing a scuba diving like thing. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6880.34s)]
*  It's going to I'm going to have like these like black flowers kind of, you know. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6884.7s)]
*  So how black and how long does this process take kind of? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6889.0599999999995s)]
*  So I think I'm I'm up to 40, 40 hours now. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6892.22s)]
*  So but but I mean, I've done like the arms. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6896.54s)]
*  We. Yeah. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6898.82s)]

*  And there's this guy in Philly that he like specializes in it. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6904.179999999999s)]
*  But it's funny because, you know, when I first got into tattooing was [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6907.74s)]
*  during a time when there was no tattoo shows or anything. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6911.78s)]
*  So it was like you would not get hired if you had a face tattoo or you know what I mean? [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6915.26s)]
*  It was a different era. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6919.46s)]
*  And then I think when like certain celebrities started [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6920.74s)]
*  getting tattooed like the Drew Barrymores and the Angelina Jolie's, like it started [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6924.860000000001s)]
*  kind of bringing it to the like if you had a tattoo, a cute one, it was OK, you know. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6928.860000000001s)]
*  And then the TV shows like blew up and then everybody has a tattoo now. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6934.3s)]
*  And it's kind of boring. But [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6938.22s)]
*  but I feel like ever since I started blacking out my tattoos, I feel like I went back to the time [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6940.38s)]
*  where people hated tattoos again, because people just do not like this. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6946.18s)]
*  They like they're very confused by why I'm doing this. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6950.3s)]
*  Every time I post progress shots, it's always like, why are you doing this to yourself? [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6953.42s)]
*  Like, this is so ugly. Like this is, you know, I think it looks for some reason. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6957.26s)]
*  I didn't know what I think. It looks nice. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6961.34s)]
*  I do, too. I like I like very interesting. Yeah. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6963.82s)]
*  It's almost fascinating in a strange way. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6967.34s)]
*  Like it's like the inverse of something. Yeah, exactly. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6969.7s)]
*  You know, it's like that car. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6973.099999999999s)]
*  It's like car. I don't know what it is. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6974.179999999999s)]
*  But it's yeah, it's I'm not I don't like pain. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6978.54s)]
*  So I, you know, I just numb myself up and, you know, he sits there and tattoos me. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6981.82s)]
*  When you say numb yourself, what do you put on the analgesic or something? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6987.26s)]
*  You do a pill? Topical anesthetics. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6990.38s)]
*  Like, oh, OK, like a cream. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6992.179999999999s)]
*  Does that work, really? Yeah. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6993.98s)]
*  I mean, it saves me like a good an hour and a half or something like that. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=6996.0599999999995s)]

*  Where do your dear folks have your folks been to visit your new place? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7075.22s)]
*  My dad has. Yeah, my dad's my contractor. So. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7078.3s)]
*  Oh, he is. Yeah. Oh, good. You can bitch at him easier. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7080.82s)]
*  And what about your mom? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7084.5s)]
*  She lives in Southern California. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7086.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Are you guys close or not? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7088.62s)]
*  Not as close. Yeah. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7091.06s)]
*  But I think, you know, once I when I had my son, I feel like she likes being a grandma. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7092.26s)]
*  Oh, she does. Yeah, I think so. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7096.9s)]
*  Yeah. That's one thing that's fascinating about kids. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7100.06s)]
*  It like gives your family a chance to like regroup a little, I think. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7101.58s)]
*  You know, I remember when my niece was born, it just like was the first time [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7105.62s)]
*  that our family started to have any semblance of a family. Oh, really? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7108.82s)]
*  Because we all had one thing in common that we cared about. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7112.42s)]
*  Yeah. And it was undisputable. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7114.78s)]
*  Yeah. And so it was like it starts to like other things start to kind of [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7116.46s)]
*  bloom from that a little bit. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7121.42s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7123.42s)]
*  Yeah, that must be traumatic hearing people's stories when they come to tattoo, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7124.9s)]
*  because some people are coming with a story, huh? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7127.62s)]
*  Yeah. Every single one. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7129.46s)]
*  I don't think I've ever tattooed somebody that just, you know, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7131.26s)]
*  was getting tattooed out of boredom or anything like that. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7133.54s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. A lot of our therapists in the world are getting [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7135.78s)]
*  they're oversaturated with pain, I think, from other people. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7140.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What do you mean? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7143.0199999999995s)]
*  I just think there's a lot of therapists, a lot of my friends that are therapists, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7144.5s)]
*  they are oversaturated with people, you know, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7147.06s)]
*  because even if somebody shares their story of our comfort or pain, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7150.7s)]
*  it still lands on somebody. Yeah. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7153.54s)]
*  You know, and I find a lot of my friends that are therapists are starting to struggle [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7155.34s)]
*  because they are like waterlogged. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7159.58s)]
*  Yeah. With other people's like trauma and sharing of it and stuff. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7162.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be a heavy job. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7166.22s)]
*  Well, that's what I thought when you said it about tattoo workers, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7167.74s)]
*  I never thought artists, tattoo artists, I'd never thought about that. Yeah. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7169.74s)]
*  I mean, I love hearing people's stories, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7173.820000000001s)]
*  so I'm always very welcoming to or I was welcoming to all that stuff. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7176.22s)]
*  So, you know, it never bothered me. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7179.42s)]
*  But I know that a lot of tattooers didn't want to. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7181.18s)]
*  Didn't want to hear it. Yeah. What would they do? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7183.1s)]
*  What do you say? Quiet tattoo time only? [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7185.14s)]
*  No, I just think that like. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7187.18s)]
*  I think when the TV shows came out, people saw it as an outlet for therapy, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7189.780000000001s)]
*  which it can be, you know, but some people aren't equipped emotionally to do that. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7194.34s)]
*  You know, for me, I'm like, I I can talk about anything. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7199.1s)]
*  I don't care. Yeah. You know, and I ended up studying books on death and everything [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7202.1s)]
*  just so I could better understand grieving processes and stuff. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7206.1s)]
*  I'm not a therapist by any means, but, you know. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7208.700000000001s)]
*  Well, these days, anybody will listen to somebody caringly, I think is. Yeah. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7212.22s)]
*  It's better than sometimes it's better even than half the stuff we have out there. Yeah. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7215.700000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of shit therapists out there, too. Yeah. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7220.14s)]
*  Yeah, because anybody can do it. Yeah. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7222.18s)]
*  You just have to go to school and then they let you do it. Yeah. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7224.46s)]
*  That's why you crazy. Yeah. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7228.02s)]
*  I wonder how much that works. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7229.820000000001s)]
*  But I mean, there's a lot of great therapists. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7232.1s)]
*  You have a lot of therapist friends. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7233.58s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of friends that are therapists. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7235.18s)]
*  And you just start to see that they're getting I start to notice a lot of them [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7236.740000000001s)]
*  having a tough time. And it's like, I think a lot of that is just [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7240.1s)]
*  them taking on that people's pain, you know? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7243.860000000001s)]
*  And I'd never thought that tattoo artists hear a lot of it. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7247.5s)]
*  Yeah. I just never even thought about it. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7249.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I different types, I'm sure. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7251.58s)]
*  Like if you're doing, you know, dragons all day, I'm sure it's not [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7253.26s)]
*  the same experience. But what's what's the toughest part for somebody [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7257.660000000001s)]
*  to get a tattoo on them? What do you mean? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7261.18s)]

*  I think. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7266.5s)]
*  Like some people assume that, like, if you have like a fatty area, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7268.5s)]
*  it's not going to hurt as much, but it's more based on your nerve setup. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7272.46s)]
*  So, you know, your your spine, you're going to have a lot of nerves [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7274.9800000000005s)]

*  like things like that are pretty sensitive. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7283.42s)]
*  But like your butt cheek is is sensitive. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7285.02s)]

*  fire. Oh, that seems scary. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7292.18s)]
*  The back of your kneecaps like. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7294.1s)]
*  Do you think there's something about the pain of getting the tattoo [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7298.26s)]
*  that is also part of the. I don't know. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7301.780000000001s)]

*  And so like, I don't want to do that in your kitchen, you know. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ-mt_y4Hk&t=7510.9s)]
