*  so they could take good, cool photos of them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  You see the ones with their tongue hanging out? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=148.07999999999998s)]

*  and all their teeth are out, so they just, yeah, they just hang out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  That's weird. I didn't know they do a pill-induced tongue out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, put that up if the Japanese were... [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=160.07999999999998s)]

*  so it was like, it made them really thirsty or just, yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think it just... [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Nicotine in the mouth a little bit. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  Like, you know, like that, yeah, like... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=171.12s)]
*  Just gives you the right... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=175.12s)]
*  Like they lived in Baltimore, kind of, you know, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=176.12s)]
*  like some of these Baltimore hitchhikers, like... [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=178.12s)]
*  Bring that up if they were... [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=181.12s)]
*  Dropping tongues out in... [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=183.12s)]
*  Japanese pilling up the dogs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=185.12s)]
*  There's a supplement. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=188.12s)]
*  No, no, no. Were the Japanese giving pills to the dogs? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=190.12s)]
*  That's all right. That's a pretty good prompt. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=194.12s)]
*  Yeah, you're just looking at medication, brother. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=197.16s)]
*  You're just looking at dog pills. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=200.16s)]
*  Or some of it, they hide a lot of the good stuff. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=202.16s)]
*  Yeah, that stuff, you got to dig deep sometimes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=205.16s)]
*  Let's see if they come back for it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=207.16s)]
*  That's not going to be on the first results. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=208.16s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=210.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, man. We got to learn to go deep, dude. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=211.16s)]
*  Sometimes the way that Google finishes your... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=214.16s)]
*  Do you ever find that, like, when you put in something [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=216.16s)]
*  and the way the search engine finishes what you started [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=218.16s)]
*  is more interesting than what you were looking for? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=220.16s)]
*  And you just go, oh, what is this? And you click that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=222.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's really weird. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=224.16s)]
*  Yeah, and all of them, it's always, like, gay. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=225.2s)]
*  It's like... [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=228.2s)]
*  Dead, gay. Yeah, it's all that stuff. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=229.2s)]

*  Good to see you. It's been a minute, man. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=236.2s)]
*  Yeah, it has been a minute. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=237.2s)]
*  Last time we saw each other, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=238.2s)]
*  we were both in the same city on tour, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=239.2s)]

*  Yeah, in Milwaukee. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=242.2s)]
*  And a pizza took forever, remember? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=243.2s)]
*  Forever. I went back and got it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=244.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was good. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=246.2s)]

*  Yeah, oh, those people were... [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=257.24s)]
*  They did not want to give it up. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=259.24s)]
*  And I'm like, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=260.24s)]
*  well, if you don't want to give out the food, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=261.24s)]

*  graduating high school or whatever, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  I was like, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  thank God I'm graduating. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  But then you don't realize that like 10 years later [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  you'd do anything to go back [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  and have one big full day of high school. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  But there was some people [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  you were looking forward to getting rid of too. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  That was the bad part, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the other side of it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  Like, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  I cannot wait till I don't have to see this person again. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  Like the ROTC guys were really at our school were very, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  they kind of acted like they were like a gang sort of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  or whatever, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  you know, like those guys with the wooden guns, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  you'd see them after school or whatever. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  And they wouldn't even have like [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=481.56s)]
*  the part of the gun that like had the bullets in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=482.56s)]
*  or something, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=484.56s)]
*  they would just have like, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=485.56s)]
*  it's like a glorified stick. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=486.56s)]
*  Yeah, dude, yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=487.56s)]
*  It was the right shape of a stick. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=489.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=490.56s)]
*  And they would be running through the halls [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=491.56s)]
*  like yelling different quadrants at each other and shit. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=493.56s)]
*  Doing this stuff and signaling. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=496.56s)]
*  You're like, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=498.56s)]
*  guys, I'm getting to algebra, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=499.56s)]
*  get out of my way. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=500.56s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=501.56s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=502.56s)]
*  we didn't have ROTC at our school, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=503.56s)]
*  but we definitely had different cliques [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=505.56s)]
*  because I went to an all-boy Catholic high school. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=508.56s)]
*  So all-boy school definitely had like a different type [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=510.6s)]
*  of like clique set up kind of thing [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=512.6s)]
*  where you had your jocks and your mathletes, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=514.6s)]
*  which I was a proud leader of. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=516.6s)]
*  Were you? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=518.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, math guy. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=519.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I was like geeky, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=520.6s)]
*  but I was a bowler. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=521.6s)]
*  We talked about this just quickly. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=522.6s)]
*  I was on the bowling team and stuff. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=524.6s)]
*  So it was like a different thing, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=525.6s)]
*  but then humor, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=527.6s)]
*  like once people found you were funny in high school [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=528.6s)]
*  and you're with all dudes, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=530.6s)]
*  I think it's a different thing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=531.6s)]
*  I think it's like, oh, you know, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=533.6s)]
*  and then people like want to be around you and having fun. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=534.6s)]
*  So once my humor started coming out, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=537.6s)]
*  it was a different animal. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=538.64s)]
*  That was so much fun. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=539.64s)]
*  Dude, being funny in high school, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=541.64s)]
*  that was like the, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=542.64s)]
*  I think that's what it was too, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=543.64s)]
*  because you always had an audience around you, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=544.64s)]
*  always had like, everybody was right there. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=546.64s)]
*  So you could make so many jokes and references [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=549.64s)]
*  and like you'd see each other in the hallway [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=552.64s)]
*  in between classes. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=554.64s)]
*  And that was the weirdest thing [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=555.64s)]
*  because you had like one second [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=556.64s)]
*  where you were passing your buddy in the hallway [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=558.64s)]
*  and you got to just... [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=560.64s)]
*  You got a drive by. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=561.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=562.64s)]
*  I was known for pratfalling in high school, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=563.64s)]
*  so I used to pratfall into my Spanish class every day [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=566.68s)]
*  and Mrs. Lonzo, my teacher, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=568.68s)]
*  always thought it was this guy, Mike Irving, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=570.68s)]
*  that was tripping me [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=572.68s)]
*  and she would always give him detention on him. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=573.68s)]
*  He was like, dude, you have to stop, stop. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=574.68s)]
*  It wasn't me. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=576.68s)]
*  And I was like, oh, he tripped me, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=577.68s)]
*  you know, like that. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=578.68s)]
*  So when I got my diploma, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=579.68s)]
*  my mom knew that I was big [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=580.68s)]
*  and my mom was always like, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=581.68s)]
*  you know, you had to be respectful. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=582.68s)]
*  So we're getting my diploma. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=583.68s)]
*  And everybody's like, trip, trip, trip. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=585.68s)]
*  Like they all want me to fall on stage. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=588.68s)]
*  And my mother like threatened my life. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=590.68s)]
*  She's like, if you trip on stage, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=591.68s)]
*  you're done, you're dead. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=593.68s)]
*  I was like, I can't make my mom mad, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  so I don't get it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=595.7199999999999s)]
*  Then I surprisingly get an award. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  I got an award. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=598.7199999999999s)]

*  and I went up and I went, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  when I went to get the award on stage, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  I bit it and I like fell off the stage. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=607.7199999999999s)]
*  The place went absolutely nuts. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=609.7199999999999s)]

*  And then some people can't be there, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=661.8s)]
*  you know, and then they feel bummed out about it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=663.8s)]
*  For sure, because somebody had to miss it [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=665.8s)]

*  but... [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=671.8s)]
*  Because the other school of thought is what? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=672.8s)]
*  Like, it's like you're making a memory [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=673.8s)]

*  and you're spending your money, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=677.8s)]
*  you might as well get this big memory out of it [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  instead of being at a, you know, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  a hall hitting the Queens, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=681.8399999999999s)]

*  But for me, we almost did it, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=686.8399999999999s)]
*  but I just, at the end of the day, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  I feel like it's a lot, it's a big ask. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  Did you ever renew your vows? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=694.8399999999999s)]
*  So after we got back together, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  my wife and I, we were thinking about doing that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=697.8399999999999s)]
*  and then we just... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=699.8399999999999s)]
*  Did you guys get divorced or no? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  No, we just got separated. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  You got separated? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=702.8399999999999s)]
*  Separated for two years and then... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=703.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow, that's a long time. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=704.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a long time. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=706.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I had never lived alone. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=707.88s)]
*  So I was 47 years old for my first time [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=709.88s)]
*  living alone in an apartment. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=712.88s)]
*  Did you get an apartment? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=713.88s)]
*  An apartment. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=714.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=715.88s)]
*  No, if you, look, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=716.88s)]
*  if you and your wife get separated, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=717.88s)]
*  you have to get an apartment. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=718.88s)]
*  You gotta get an apartment. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=719.88s)]
*  You can't get a house, dude. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=720.88s)]
*  You can't get a house, no. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=721.88s)]
*  You're in the ditch. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=722.88s)]
*  No, that's what, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=723.88s)]
*  that was actually the reason kind of like [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=724.88s)]
*  why we got back together was [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=726.88s)]
*  I had put a bid in on a house [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=728.88s)]
*  because it was like, okay, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=731.88s)]
*  this is not happening. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=732.88s)]
*  And I was like, I'm a grown man, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=733.88s)]
*  I'm not going to live in this apartment. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=734.88s)]
*  I needed a yard, I had my dogs. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=735.88s)]
*  I'm like, I just didn't want, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=736.92s)]
*  there was a fire drill in my building. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=737.92s)]
*  I'm outside at 1130 in my robe. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=739.92s)]
*  And so I was like, are you Joe from practice? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=741.92s)]
*  I'm like, get the hell out. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=742.92s)]
*  Like, this is my life right now. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=743.92s)]
*  So I was like, yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=744.92s)]
*  So I put a bid on a house and I didn't get it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=745.92s)]
*  Could you imagine you're going [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=748.92s)]
*  to the fire drill of your building [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=749.92s)]
*  and Joe is there in his bathrobe. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=752.92s)]
*  I was like, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=754.92s)]
*  With how many dogs? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=755.92s)]
*  Two dogs in my arms. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=756.92s)]
*  Like Cruella Joville. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=757.92s)]
*  You're just out there [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=758.92s)]
*  with a fucking million pups. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=759.92s)]
*  So it was like, yeah, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=760.92s)]
*  so it was rough. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=761.92s)]
*  And then, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=762.92s)]
*  so then I put a bid on a house [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=763.92s)]
*  and I didn't get it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=764.92s)]
*  And then I was like, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=765.9599999999999s)]
*  I had to look at another house [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  and I said to her, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=767.9599999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, what about, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  I was like, I'm looking at this house. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=769.9599999999999s)]
*  It wasn't too far from the kids. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  And she just went, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=771.9599999999999s)]
*  do you want to get back together? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  And I just instantly, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=773.9599999999999s)]
*  I just went, yeah, do you? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  And she goes, yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=775.9599999999999s)]

*  we said it out loud. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=777.9599999999999s)]
*  We both weren't thinking [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  we were going to. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=779.9599999999999s)]

*  and we were waiting in a hotel room [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=785.9599999999999s)]
*  for the dogs to be ready. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=786.9599999999999s)]

*  I always went [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=833.54s)]
*  I always went to the house for dinner [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=834.56s)]
*  The kids didn't [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=835.56s)]
*  know of any sort of disruption [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=836.56s)]
*  So that was always good [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=838.06s)]
*  I was always at the house [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=839.06s)]
*  having dinner, family dinner [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=840.06s)]

*  know anything [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=843.56s)]
*  because they are 9 and 7 now [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=844.56s)]
*  because they are 9 and seven now [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=845.56s)]
*  Because they are 9 and 7 now [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=846.56s)]

*  and for a night up at this farm in upstate New York, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=858.1999999999999s)]
*  and just all worked out. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=862.04s)]
*  You know, it was a lot of conversations. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=863.16s)]
*  A lot of hard stuff you got to talk through, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=864.76s)]

*  yeah, this is always good and this is always bad, right? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1279.6399999999999s)]
*  This is good. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1282.04s)]
*  This is bad. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1282.6s)]
*  This one is so yeah, this is bad. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1283.32s)]
*  This is, this is never good. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1286.4399999999998s)]
*  This could be bad with a thumbs down. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1287.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1289.1599999999999s)]
*  I think every, every finger has a personality. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1289.56s)]
*  Kind of, right? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1291.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1292.76s)]
*  So you could use this for that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1293.24s)]
*  This is, this is kind of, this is probably the most useless, right? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1294.6s)]
*  The ring finger. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1297.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, unless you, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1298.12s)]
*  when you were a little kid, this became a big, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1299.32s)]
*  because you'd be like, I'm not giving you the finger. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1300.84s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1302.52s)]
*  You would hide it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1303.56s)]
*  Yeah. You hide it like, oh, I'm just kidding. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1304.2s)]
*  But this one is also the ring finger. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1305.24s)]
*  So it also is like the- [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1307.0s)]
*  Signifies. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1308.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1308.76s)]
*  Someone has claimed you. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1309.32s)]
*  Yeah. You're locked in. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1310.76s)]

*  Hitchhike. The thumb has the most versatile, I think. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1317.08s)]
*  Hitchhiking, you're the best, kill them. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1319.08s)]
*  Kill them, right? Murder. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1321.8s)]
*  This is a murder indicator, straight murder. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1322.68s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1325.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1326.1200000000001s)]

*  Thumbs up. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1330.76s)]
*  Teach your kids, because a lot of times your kids are like far away if they're scared or something. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1331.08s)]
*  Teach them to give you a thumbs up if they're okay or a thumbs down if they're not. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1335.56s)]
*  Because if you can't see them or you know, if you only see them, you can't hear them. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=1338.28s)]

*  like, quit fucking eating, dude. You don't fucking eat in front of a possible death situation. Like [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2116.84s)]
*  seven feet over, you can hear this guy like struggling for his life, dude. Right. And this [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2124.2s)]
*  guy's chomping on his cornflakes over here and magic Johnson was there, dude. So at a certain [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2129.72s)]
*  point, and this took a long time, they were trying to revive the guy. And so at a certain [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2136.2s)]
*  point, everybody starts looking at magic Johnson, like fucking do something magic Johnson. Your [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2140.2s)]
*  magic. Yeah. It's in your name. Like just, yeah, go double dribble on his heart or something. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2144.12s)]
*  Do that, right? Cross over his arteries. Right. Do something. You can tell it, you can't fucking pat [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2149.16s)]
*  him on the back in a special way. Yeah. At least give him a hug or something. One more assist. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2155.48s)]
*  And so it got so crazy. And then nobody would eat, dude, cause they were really like, boom, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2161.64s)]
*  raging into him and beating on his chest or whatever. And, um, and then finally, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2165.96s)]
*  they took him out of there. I don't, I, I, he didn't make it. I know that, but. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2174.84s)]
*  So that was his last breakfast. It was last breakfast, but at a certain point we'd all [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2180.2s)]
*  sat there and then somebody has to take the first bite. And the guy with the cornflakes is who's [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2184.92s)]
*  laughing now. I didn't miss a step. I'm ready to go. Yeah. Taking the first bite in that situation [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2191.0s)]

*  else. I think everybody looks at magic Johnson in that situation. And I think ceremoniously, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2207.0s)]
*  he should be like, let's eat. It's like your dad at Thanksgiving when he's like, okay, we could do [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2210.52s)]
*  it. Like I've done carving. We could eat. Yeah. Like anything he puts it out. But that was crazy, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2215.08s)]
*  man. So yeah, I mean, it's crazy because you're in the guy who can, who is magic himself and he [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2220.44s)]
*  could do nothing. Yeah. You know, I think it'd be worse if there was a real magician there. Like if [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2227.0s)]
*  David Blaine was there and they're like, dude, make the chicken bone and his throat disappear. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2233.32s)]
*  Make it come out of behind his ears. He pulled those rags out until it's a chicken. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2238.28s)]
*  That's right. At the end, he's got the bone coming out. Right. Yeah. I think that'd be tough. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2242.68s)]
*  Um, yeah, dude, that flooding stuff. This makes me so sad. And it doesn't seem like there's much [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2246.9199999999996s)]
*  you can do. You can donate, right? Like I've reached out to a couple of friends to find ways [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2252.2799999999997s)]

*  to the mall. So this is your one shot. Like I'm going to go and see what's on the sale rack. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2311.72s)]

*  I've come to some sort of tragedy like that. Yeah. It's always tough, but I do find always, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2390.6s)]
*  people always say this, you know, people come together when it's that, like I find that so [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2398.2s)]
*  true. Don't you? About like human nature shines brightest when it's tragedy, when it's wrapped [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2401.24s)]
*  in tragedy. I think people just come together in a real way and be like, we gotta tackle this thing. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2405.9599999999996s)]

*  like I remember when my father passed away and they were like, people would send food to the house [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2431.08s)]
*  and my mom was the one that cooked. It was like, she's like, no, I still got this, but do you know [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2436.84s)]
*  how to like to pay the electric bill? Why does that work? You know, it seems so funny. But food is [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2440.68s)]
*  always such a thing of like, we gotta feed these people, right? It's just the thing that people [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2446.28s)]

*  your ideas are, I'm a storyteller. So I just like figure out what stories I want to tell. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2555.4s)]
*  But I'd always talk about sitting alone. Like I was stuck with my thoughts so much where I was [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2559.48s)]
*  thinking about how you end up the person that you are. So my let's get into a tour really is like [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2563.48s)]

*  geeky kid. Like I used to make tests for my father, like open up the encyclopedias. He would come home [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2570.76s)]
*  and I would have a multiple choice exam from him after his 10 hour day trying to sell life [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2575.8s)]
*  insurance door to door. I'd be like pop quiz, bitch, like get out of here, you know, like that. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=2579.8s)]

*  So Bugs Bunny would be standing there with a stop sign when you pulled into the lot. And he did [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4330.360000000001s)]
*  50 versions of it. And I bought one of those, but it's huge. It's the size of like this. So I actually [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4334.28s)]
*  mounted it inside a sliding door in my house. Oh, it stays in there? Yeah, it stays in there. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4340.84s)]

*  Yeah. I grew up with it. So I was like, I was like, Oh, that's really cool that actually it is [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4362.360000000001s)]

*  and for the stranded astronauts, the arrival of their ride home, perhaps an additional reason [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4522.76s)]
*  for Butch and Sunny to celebrate. The space X rescue mission was launched from Florida with just [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4528.12s)]
*  two astronauts on board. The other two seats kept free for the extra passengers when it returns to [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4538.2s)]
*  earth in February. It is a coup for the company, but an embarrassment for Boeing, which is still [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4544.36s)]
*  trying to work out why thrusters on its own starliner capsule failed as it docked in June, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4550.12s)]
*  leaving the test pilots marooned. Lots of cheering here in the room. There you go. So, so they called [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4556.2s)]

*  Elon space X is going to pick up these two stranded astronauts, bro. Imagine being just stranded out [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4572.12s)]
*  there. That's insane. Imagine you think you're going home, you're supposed to go home. And then [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4578.759999999999s)]
*  they're like, no, it's going to be from June to February. It's going to be seven more months, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4582.839999999999s)]
*  eight more months. I mean, there's gotta be nine more months. Sorry. Nine months. Do they have enough [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4587.48s)]
*  food packets of oatmeal? They kind of have enough. I bet they pack like a head, but like surely [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4592.839999999999s)]
*  nine months more. Yeah, that's a full baby being born. Even the person who packed it up was probably [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4598.759999999999s)]
*  like, they're not going to be out there that long. Yeah. Yeah. Let's take some of this oatmeal home. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4604.679999999999s)]
*  They don't need this much. Is it not? Yeah. You think they need 80 jars of applesauce? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4610.679999999999s)]
*  Give them 68 and 11. No, the difference. Meanwhile, they're up there like licking this [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4615.719999999999s)]
*  spoon. We just had 12 more jars. God, dude. But yeah, Elon's going to get them. I actually [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4620.36s)]
*  tweeted at him the other day to see if they would let me, I wanted to interview the, oh, go. It would [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4627.08s)]
*  be sick, dude. They're sending Theo to go pick him up. Would you take that risk, you think, if they [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4632.04s)]
*  said you could go? No, definitely not. Definitely not. That's a big risk, I feel like. Yeah, but [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4637.719999999999s)]
*  that would be, that's a one in a bajillion thing. Nobody else would ever say they did that. Yeah. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4642.36s)]
*  Pick them up. Who'd they send? Did they send people that were equipped to do it or was it? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4647.24s)]
*  I don't know. Hopefully they sent Ben Affleck because- [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4651.719999999999s)]
*  He's working on the drill. Well, I think he could just use- [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4655.08s)]
*  Him and Bruce Willis is who I want to send, right? They got that work experience. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4657.0s)]
*  Bruce Willis is already, he's out of space currently. I think he's true. He has dementia [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4661.16s)]
*  right now, which is basically free outer space. You know what I'm saying? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4664.92s)]
*  He's just there. And I'm just joking, Bruce Willis. Yes. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4668.2s)]
*  But no, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore have been strained during the ISS since June after [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4672.04s)]
*  the Boeing spacecraft suffered thruster failures. SpaceX rescue flight will not return until February. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4676.84s)]
*  Oh wait, it arrived already though. So they already picked them up. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4683.96s)]
*  No way. But arrived just after 10 30 PM on Sunday. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4687.0s)]
*  Oh, so they already- They're there. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4689.56s)]
*  They're already in. That was really them picking them up. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4690.92s)]
*  They're in today. They're in, but at the ride back, they're hitting some traffic. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4692.6s)]
*  It looks like the Waze map is telling them that they're going to be hitting some traffic. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4697.08s)]
*  Okay, so they got them. So halfway there. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4701.32s)]
*  So coming back must take so much longer then. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4704.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. How'd they get there? So quick. That doesn't make sense. I guess so. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4706.839999999999s)]
*  Let me see. When did they leave to go get them? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4712.04s)]
*  NASA confirmed in August that the two will return to Earth and will not return until 2025 with SpaceX [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4714.5199999999995s)]
*  now in charge of rescuing the astronauts on a crew dragon flight. But what's the plan if they [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4719.799999999999s)]
*  don't send SpaceX? What's the plan? How do they get these guys home? They put their homes out the side [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4724.36s)]
*  and go home. Like in a war or a crew situation. Like, come on, stroke, stroke. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4728.839999999999s)]
*  Take me to the river. Right? What is the plan? What is [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4734.839999999999s)]
*  Boeing's plan? Oh, that's crazy. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4738.599999999999s)]
*  If Elon doesn't bail them out like that. That's crazy that there's a late- Yeah. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4740.36s)]
*  But everybody's flights are getting delayed now. That's the crazy thing. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4744.36s)]
*  You're equating a Southwest flight being delayed. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4748.12s)]
*  It's still a flight. It's true. I guess I'll favor. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4752.28s)]
*  Everybody's having trouble, dude. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4756.12s)]
*  Nobody's above it, man. We're all just human at the end of the day. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4757.88s)]
*  But yeah, I wanted to get to interview the two astronauts, podcast with them. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4763.88s)]
*  They'll come. You think so? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4769.08s)]
*  I mean, it would be interesting. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4770.92s)]
*  Yeah. If they're fans, yeah, sure. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4772.28s)]
*  If they don't have anything to do also, you know? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4773.72s)]
*  I mean, their job's done. They never have to work a day again in their life. They're done. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4777.639999999999s)]
*  They get some sort of pension. You kidding? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4781.4s)]
*  Name a bigger hero. You went and saved two people from space. That's a movie plot, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4785.4s)]
*  a real-life movie plot. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4790.2s)]
*  But that's working for NASA. That's working for the government, man. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4791.4s)]
*  Dude, you work at the post office. They barely give you a fucking, you know? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4794.04s)]
*  That's true. Some guy was stalled over on McDougal. They couldn't pick him up for three weeks. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4796.76s)]
*  Where's Jim? Oh, his car broke down on McDougal. We'll see him in March. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4803.72s)]
*  Yeah, so let's don't put it past the government. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4809.48s)]
*  First of all, if the government said, hey, I want to take you and a buddy to space, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4812.6s)]
*  I'd be like, fuck no, dude. You guys can't even decide on a correct price of stamps, dude. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4815.72s)]
*  All expense paid. You guys are going to space. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4821.64s)]
*  Thanks. I'm good. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4825.16s)]
*  I'd be like, dear God, no. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4825.72s)]
*  But everything's become privatized now. That's just how everything is, you know? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4828.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Even rescue missions, apparently. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4831.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4834.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4835.0s)]
*  It's like it used to be everything was kind of like the public things were rocking, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=4835.64s)]

*  just some of those conversations, it's not as fun, you know, it's just, it's not as fun. Yeah. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5257.8s)]
*  Yeah. And then you want- That's why people don't really talk about politics, you know, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5261.56s)]
*  because it's like, it's a divisive in nature. Yeah. You got to pick a side. So yeah, you want [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5264.68s)]
*  to be respectful too of what somebody thinks, but at the same time, sometimes it's like, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5268.76s)]
*  you don't want to get into like a rebuttal and then it's like, you know, so it's just some of [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5271.72s)]
*  that. It's kind of like a learning curve, even with doing podcasts and it's like, how do you [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5276.2s)]
*  get into conversations with people also when they have more knowledge and you do too about stuff, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5281.400000000001s)]
*  because you're learning and contributing at the same time. Or they think they have more knowledge, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5286.2s)]
*  you know, because then you feel like, well, I think something, but I may not know a fact on it, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5289.16s)]
*  but it is how I feel, you know, and like when to speak up. When people try to talk you out of [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5294.28s)]
*  feelings, that's like the worst thing ever. When you feel a certain way about anything, you know, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5298.76s)]
*  and they try to like disprove how you feel about something, like I feel like that's wrong. Well, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5303.08s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. And I hit you with all these like facts, which some were probably made up, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5307.24s)]
*  you don't even know. And it's like, okay, but I still feel that way. Yeah. What are you trying [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5310.04s)]
*  to talk me out of? You know, exactly, dude. Yeah. That's an interesting thing. What else is [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5314.2s)]
*  happening in the news? What else is going on, man? You read the news when you wake up? How do you get [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5319.16s)]
*  your news? That's a good question. Yeah. Probably TikTok websites. That's it really. So that comes [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5324.92s)]
*  across your radar. Yeah. Kind of like that are things that I'll see kind of over and over again. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5338.2s)]
*  Dude, you see that snake that's head got bit off and it's still bit itself. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5342.68s)]
*  Watch this. They cut the snake's head off, right? Yeah. That's its head at the bottom. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5349.72s)]
*  That is insane. And so, yeah, that's from Satan, dude. You think it's having a bad day and then [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5357.0s)]
*  it just gets away from you. Bro, look at that. It's head was a foot away from the end of its body. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5363.56s)]
*  It taps it and then there you go. And then the other end of the snake curls over and touches the [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5373.88s)]
*  head just reflexively. And it just opens his mouth and instinctually just chomps down on itself. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5379.400000000001s)]
*  And now the snake is like, not only have I lost my head, but now it's biting me. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5385.88s)]
*  Look, I've tried to do some things to myself. That's a talent right there. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5390.2s)]
*  In junior high or whatever, but this is kind of crazy, bro. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5394.679999999999s)]
*  Did you, do you have a fear of anything? Are you afraid of snakes? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5398.2s)]
*  Snakes make me very nervous. That makes me, I'm not really afraid of snakes. That clip changes my opinion. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5402.36s)]
*  It makes me feel like they're directly from Satan. Also huge corporations make me very nervous. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5408.12s)]
*  Snakes and huge corporations. And sheer evil. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5415.16s)]
*  Those are tough. Yeah. And genocide also makes me nervous too, a little bit. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5417.959999999999s)]
*  And we're talking to no particular order. All three of those things make me pretty nervous. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5422.36s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes you see animals pull off some stuff and you just can't believe that they're [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5428.2s)]
*  real with stuff. You ever see like when you see these Falcons, they're like a hundred feet out [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5434.599999999999s)]
*  of the water and they see a fish and they just dive, get it out of the water and just come up [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5439.799999999999s)]
*  and have lunch. It's like, I missed a turn on the way here and I have GPS. It's like crazy. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5443.64s)]
*  It's crazy what some of these animals could do, but biting yourself when you head off, that's, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5449.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. That's bonkers. That's some diddy shit. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5453.64s)]
*  Look at those. These are, these are nuts. They just die and they go underwater. They can't, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5457.160000000001s)]
*  and they can't breathe them. They just dive in and go in. You just like, Oh, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5460.68s)]
*  I'm just going to grab this fish right out of the water. Oh, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5463.64s)]
*  if you could train a Falcon to do that and you showed up like at a bass tournament, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5467.240000000001s)]
*  everybody's there with their rods. You're just there with the little helmet on it. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5470.52s)]
*  Go ahead. Maximus. Yeah. In 30 minutes you got, you're done. I love birds. You're done [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5476.6s)]
*  for the day. You do love birds. And if I could have a Falcon, I'd have a Falcon. I had a, I had a, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5483.0s)]
*  I had a African gray parrot for a minute. The best Maximus's name was his little bird. I had [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5488.200000000001s)]
*  him so fun. Yeah. Those guys are super smart. And are these the ones that can read and write [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5494.4400000000005s)]
*  or no? Yeah. They're, they're the most intelligent of the parrot. Yeah. They got their red tail. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5500.12s)]
*  They're really fun, but I didn't teach it how to talk because I only taught it to go like that [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5503.4s)]
*  because they live to 80 years old. I don't want 80 years old to like, hello. Like I don't want 80 [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5509.08s)]
*  years of staying alone with this bird. So I didn't teach it how to say anything. So like, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5513.8s)]
*  what am I going to do? I'm going to be answering questions. That's like having a toddler, whatever. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5518.36s)]
*  You don't teach him anything. It's a bird though. He liked his life for a while. It was great. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5521.4s)]
*  And what happened in the end? I moved, I, I ended up moving to LA and I didn't have an apartment or [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5526.12s)]
*  anything and I was living with a friend so I couldn't bring a bird in a bird cage with me. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5531.64s)]
*  So I ended up, there was this bird rescuer that worked at, with the Bronx Zoo and she, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5534.84s)]
*  she came over and took it and interviewed her and she was really nice. So they got a good zoo in [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5540.44s)]
*  the Bronx. A lot of union work, a lot of union animals. A lot of union animals up there. It's [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5544.5199999999995s)]
*  clean. A lot of union animals. Yeah. The Bronx Zoo is like one of the biggest ones. Wow. It's a, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5548.36s)]
*  they do a big thing at the holidays too. I think all the zoos do it where they light up like, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5552.36s)]
*  do that like at night thing. Oh yeah. And it's really, really cool. Animals at night or whatever. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5555.64s)]
*  Like, yeah. I saw, when I went to Australia, I did the weirdest thing. I, they had the, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5560.04s)]
*  the nocturnal animals, they change their clock on them. So they make, they're all indoors in this [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5566.04s)]
*  facility, right? There's like these mice and whatnot and they change their clock because [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5571.320000000001s)]
*  they are supposed to be asleep at night that they make it sun at night inside this building. It's [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5574.84s)]
*  sun up. And then during the day they make it night in this building. Isn't that a war crime? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5580.84s)]
*  I think these mice are like, Hey, they get, they haven't get out in the wild. It's not going to do [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5585.96s)]
*  it. But it's great. You walk in, it's like, you're walking through the prairies at night. I think it [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5589.5599999999995s)]
*  was in Sydney, the Sydney zoo or wherever I was. And it was crazy. Like you walked in and it was [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5592.679999999999s)]

*  of half this shit. Yeah. We're part of the mix way more. It's a hundred percent. Like we have to put [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5812.759999999999s)]
*  these animals in cages to control them and stuff. And we're like, we're the dumbest features. Like, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5816.839999999999s)]
*  yeah, really? Let them out of the zoo and see what happens. I think it's crazy that way. Yeah. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5820.12s)]
*  I love animals though. Yeah, man. I think I wish I would spend more time running my, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5827.4s)]
*  we had a, this neuroscientist on and she was saying that, yeah, being around animals, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5832.2s)]
*  being around horses, horses, even just if you have a big family and you all sleep together in [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5836.12s)]

*  Horses are used a lot in therapy, right? Equine therapy, what they call it. We like hug a horse [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5847.5599999999995s)]
*  and go to a ranch for like a month. Yeah. Those are big. They think it's like a horse hugging. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5851.0s)]
*  That's the thing. I didn't make that up. But then it can escalate too. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5854.44s)]
*  I found love in Arizona. You'll end up in a deep, in one of those donkey shows or whatever. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5860.2s)]
*  How does equine therapy help trauma victims? That's a good question. Equine therapy is an [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5866.759999999999s)]
*  excellent option for trauma victims who have a hard time opening up about their experiences or [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5871.08s)]
*  who feel overwhelmed, anxiety or panic. Equine therapy provides a unique environment in which [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5874.919999999999s)]
*  individuals are able to heal their invisible wounds in a way that is intuitive and fun. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5880.6s)]
*  It's fun. Therapy can be fun, man. This is a website, I think, trying to sell us something. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5887.0s)]

*  Yeah, there's a- Because how do you do it? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5897.96s)]
*  So it's basically just kind of like you're around, because they're low stress animals or like, you [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5901.240000000001s)]
*  have to be calm around a horse, so you have to calm yourself down. I think that's part of it. So [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5905.8s)]
*  I think that does it. But it's weird. You see these people, they're laying down with the horses [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5909.48s)]
*  and just petting them and they're, you see the problems they were dealing with. It's crazy. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5915.0s)]

*  strength. No, the psychological effects of equine assistant therapy come from the horse's ability [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5941.16s)]
*  to recognize human emotions and provide an intentional response. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5946.76s)]
*  Okay. So if you're freaking out, they'll just come over and be like, look, it's okay. I'm a horse. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=5950.36s)]

*  you think this is going to be a great part of it. And then you go and just some other stupid thing [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6613.0s)]

*  star Wars ride and he didn't, he didn't really, he'd never been on a ride and he never saw star Wars. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6641.400000000001s)]

*  I want to go back to earth. And it was so funny. And like I saw, and I was told Steve [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6653.24s)]
*  burn that story as we were driving and he's like, dude, you gotta try that in the hour. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6657.0s)]

*  I just started in belt, like working it out and you know, figuring out what a punch is wearing. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6665.8s)]
*  It was, it's such a cool part, but I had never really talked about my kids at all. And that was [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6669.0s)]
*  like, that's a really cool piece to add to the puzzle. And a really cool way to do it. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6673.56s)]

*  unbelievable, but it's also an immersive experience, which means everybody who works on the ride is in [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6692.2s)]
*  character. They play a character. So when the ride starts, you're in the woods with all the rebels. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6697.16s)]
*  And they move me down the line. Thanks for joining the fight. You go through the woods, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxeL9Vx4YM&t=6700.92s)]
