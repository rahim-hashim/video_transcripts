*  We've added a second show in Belfast over in the United Kingdom on June 6th. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3.56s)]
*  Tickets are available now for that show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=11.56s)]
*  And we're going to do more shows in Europe or white Europe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=13.34s)]
*  And we just haven't had the chance to get them on. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=19.64s)]
*  So it'll happen in the future. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=22.62s)]

*  overpay for tickets. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=58.5s)]

*  And that's unbelievable to me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=70.06s)]

*  I love you guys. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=89.9s)]
*  And yeah, dang, bro. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=91.26s)]

*  And I can say first and foremost, honestly, one of the best live shows around. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=106.54s)]

*  Today's guest is Mr. Zach Brown. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=120.42s)]
*  I'm off the stage. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=135.78s)]
*  I left my phone somewhere yesterday. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=151.54s)]
*  And I don't know if you've done that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=156.22s)]
*  You used the Find My rig on it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=159.62s)]
*  Oh, I didn't have any of that set up. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=161.34s)]
*  Yeah, for two hours, I didn't have my phone. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  It's a scary thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=168.78s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=169.66s)]
*  And look, here's the crazy part. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=170.38s)]
*  I was OK. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=172.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=173.82s)]
*  That was the kind of the- [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=174.34s)]
*  Did you feel your pocket vibrate? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=175.06s)]
*  Oh, I felt- [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=176.42s)]
*  Did you have it in there? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=177.26s)]
*  Yeah, well, I kept feeling my pockets. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=178.62s)]
*  I was like, well, did I make sure I felt my pockets, which was kind of a crazy thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=180.66s)]
*  Oh, when I run out of Zen or I don't have my can of Zen in my pocket, bro, I'll pat my pants like every 15 seconds. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=184.22s)]
*  I'm like, it's the worst feeling like a fucking crackhead chasing a pebble, dude. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=190.5s)]
*  I'm like, I'm like digging in the carpet. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=194.58s)]
*  I'm like, oh, shit, I don't have any Zen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=196.58s)]
*  Yeah, I was even feeling on different parts of my pants I'd never felt on before, too. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=199.78s)]
*  Like, could it be like, is it- [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=203.38s)]
*  In my cup? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=205.38s)]
*  Yeah, like where did I put it? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=206.06s)]
*  And it is crazy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=209.38s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be like, oh, maybe I didn't feel my pockets well enough. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=210.18s)]
*  That would be the thought that would come to my head. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  And I would go back and do it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=215.06s)]
*  And those cicadas are coming. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=218.18s)]
*  Do you know about it? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=219.5s)]
*  No. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=221.1s)]
*  The cicadas, bro, are on the horizon. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=222.02s)]
*  They're coming. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=225.74s)]
*  So it's an insect, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=227.98s)]
*  I know what cicadas are. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=230.7s)]
*  OK, beautiful insect. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=231.7s)]
*  Really, the El Caminos of insect, kind of if you look at them, very unique, appreciated, and do their own thing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=234.38s)]
*  But they have this year is a special year where this year they have two broods and they usually don't happen at the same time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=241.98s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=247.22s)]
*  And this is the first time since the 1800, 1805 or something that they are both happening at the same time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=247.7s)]
*  So there will be some parts of the country, I think it's just like an Illinois where that'll get both of them at the same time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  And it'll be so loud you won't even be able to hear. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  It's like the locusts are coming. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=264.26s)]
*  It's like Alfred Hitchcock shit where people are like running around hiding in their bathrooms and shit. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=265.18s)]
*  Yeah, awesome. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=270.3s)]
*  Yeah, so if your spouse goes missing during that time, then that's on Mother Nature, I think. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=271.94s)]
*  But yeah, that's coming up pretty soon. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=278.38s)]
*  I think it's in May and early June. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=280.58s)]
*  So Zach Brown, man, good to see you, dude. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=284.26s)]
*  Likewise. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=287.1s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=287.9s)]
*  Thanks, bro. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=288.66s)]
*  I appreciate you coming in, man. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=289.42s)]
*  How are you? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=290.66s)]
*  I'm doing great. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=291.18s)]
*  Yeah, doing awesome. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=292.1s)]
*  You got a new song really doing well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=293.1s)]
*  Yeah, I got a new one out, Summertime Song. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=295.1s)]
*  So we did a summer EP. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=297.3s)]
*  You never really put together like just a bunch of like this kind of songs before. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=298.38s)]
*  So we had the one we did for Jimmy Buffett to the Pirates in Paris, which just came out. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=302.3s)]
*  So that's part of that's kind of the slow run, but the other ones are all just kind of a beat, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=306.9s)]
*  just like lake or beach music stuff. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=310.82s)]
*  So yeah, Tops is the one that's out right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=313.82s)]
*  And it's good shit, man. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=316.26s)]
*  It's always fun. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=318.14s)]
*  It's like when you write a new song, it's like having a new baby, you know, it's like just excited to get it out and play it live and hear people sing it back to you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=318.85999999999996s)]
*  So it's a good time, fun time for that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=326.02s)]
*  Yeah, well, I guess what's that like? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=329.06s)]
*  It's like you get that song out there and then the first time you get it out there and you start to see that people know it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=330.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=335.46s)]
*  And usually if you see people like taking their shirts off while you're playing it, you know, it's going to be a good one. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=336.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=341.38s)]
*  Out in the crowd. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=342.58s)]
*  So that's where those people are women, I think. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=343.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=345.82s)]
*  But normally the ones that wanted the women that want to do that are not the ones that you want to see do that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=346.41999999999996s)]
*  But it's still out there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=351.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=352.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=353.17999999999995s)]
*  You get to see what their R&D is like the relative nipple diameter. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  Oh, is that relative to the size of the person breast itself? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=358.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  So is it like a mortadella, like a big salami slice, or is it just like a little tiny olive or something? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=364.46s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=371.78s)]
*  Like a little pimento or whatever. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=372.62s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=374.34s)]
*  Oh, dang, I didn't think about that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=375.5s)]
*  I wonder who has the largest breast and the smallest nipple, you know? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  That's got to be a Guinness thing, man. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=381.58s)]
*  Somebody's had to be recorded on that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=383.34s)]
*  You think it would probably be somebody that maybe be like kind of Swedish, Vietnamese, maybe, I feel like. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=385.53999999999996s)]

*  That'd leave like where there's no areola, it's just the tipple. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=393.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's it, brother. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=396.06s)]

*  Yeah, you've had success, man. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=431.22s)]
*  When did you start to like you've had a lot of success, right? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=432.74s)]
*  You've had a long time of success. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=435.66s)]
*  I've been blessed, man. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=438.18s)]
*  Been blessed, but worked hard to get there, you know, just grinding, man. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=439.18s)]
*  Grinding for years and years to get to the beginning of the success. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=443.78000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=448.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=449.74s)]
*  Do you remember like your first definition kind of of success? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=450.38s)]
*  And then do you feel like it's kind of changed over time? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=452.9s)]
*  It does, man. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=455.46s)]
*  I think, you know, you constantly every few years have to redefine what success means to you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=456.14s)]
*  But, you know, back in the early days, it was like, I want to get a gig or play some music in a bar, you know, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  and have them pay me and want me to come back. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=468.02s)]
*  You know, that's kind of the first step. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=470.14s)]
*  And I was playing backup for this guy, just playing guitar for him and like singing backup for a dude. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=471.98s)]
*  I was making a hundred bucks a night doing that and missing my early classes in college because of it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=477.14000000000004s)]
*  But that was the first time. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=482.54s)]
*  But even back then, when I was a kid, like I was in choir, like first grade through, you know, all the way through college. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=485.26000000000005s)]
*  And I used a little songbird, huh? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I just music was my first love, man. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=493.14000000000004s)]
*  And it's still like one of my biggest loves that I have, you know, it just moved me, man. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=495.62s)]
*  And it's it's always been like my safety blanket as well. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=501.26000000000005s)]
*  Like when I had my guitar with me as a kid, like I carried it to school every day. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=505.66s)]
*  I was that kid, like had a guitar with me, like football practice after football practice. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=509.7s)]
*  It actually kept me getting hazed and playing football. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=514.62s)]
*  It's like when I went to high school and was playing high school ball, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=518.38s)]
*  if I could play some Pink Floyd, if I could play some Wish You Were Here or something the guys would want to do, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=523.1s)]
*  then they wouldn't rub Bengay on my nuts like they would all the other freshmen. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=526.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=529.98s)]
*  So you can't beat up the guy if you need him to do something for you later. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=530.62s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. That worked out good. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=534.1s)]
*  That's a great thing. It's like that is such a great survival skill. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=536.82s)]
*  You're like, I have to be of value to these people in some way, shape or form. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  And where was that in Georgia where you're at? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=545.1s)]
*  Yeah. And Forsyth County, Georgia, which was pretty wild growing up there because [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=546.9s)]
*  when I was probably eight or nine, you go to Wal-Mart and there'd be a full like KKK rally happening in the parking lot. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=553.5s)]
*  No way. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=560.9s)]
*  Hoods and robes and beating on windows and handing out flyers. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=561.74s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, that was like it was not that long ago. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  But Forsyth County was pretty, you know, well known for that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=569.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? And yeah, figuring out what to do with that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=573.42s)]
*  And then I remember later, you know, when I was. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=576.82s)]
*  Yeah, when I was a freshman, we had the first ever African-American kid in the schools there that came there. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=582.3s)]
*  No way. Yeah. And he was fast, too. He was fast. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=587.3s)]
*  Well, he had to play football with us. And but yeah, it's wild just thinking, man, it wasn't that long ago that it's like back back then. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=591.1s)]
*  You know, it wasn't that far back. Yeah, it is kind of crazy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=598.58s)]
*  Well, I remember growing when I was growing up in our town, like a lot of black folks didn't have you couldn't even have like like the one of the kind of top jobs you would have would maybe be like a teacher. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=601.4200000000001s)]
*  Like you didn't have like black doctors and stuff in our town. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=611.9s)]
*  You know, when I was a kid, I've talked about that on here a lot. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=614.78s)]
*  But, you know, it's crazy to think that that that a part of that was alive in your life, you know. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=616.8199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. It was that, you know, the straight up hoods. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=623.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's crazy. Where would they meet at? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=627.06s)]
*  Like a dollar general or whatever. Dude, I don't know. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=629.86s)]
*  I don't know. But but up in Dahlonega, where I ended up moving for and graduating from high school up in North Georgia, where I'm from there, like the dude we knew like the Grand Wizard lived in that house. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=632.38s)]
*  I was like his house and it was it was trick or treat there. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=641.22s)]
*  No, they give out like razor blades and M 80s or something. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=646.54s)]
*  Yes. You know, yeah, I think he would definitely. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=649.74s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=651.94s)]
*  Yeah, because I actually shared a fence with David Duke, actually, who was a part of the I think he was like one of the assistant chiefs or something like that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=654.46s)]
*  Of the Klu Klux Klan at one point, dude, they had a restaurant I remember called Klu Klux Clams, dude, in. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=665.94s)]
*  Homa, Louisiana for a while. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=674.66s)]
*  It was kind of like a little bit of like kind of racial seafood kind of spot or whatever. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=676.7s)]
*  But, yeah, I mean, it's definitely crazy to think, you know, I never saw David do do anything racist. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=680.94s)]
*  But, you know, obviously he had that in him in his past, you know. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=687.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of it, too, is, you know, it is. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=690.98s)]
*  Kind of based on just not being exposed to good people of all different kinds. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=697.38s)]
*  And that's like, you know, and I'm sure you feel the same way, like getting to travel with what we do. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=702.22s)]
*  Like, I've been on the road since I was, you know, 17, like just all over everywhere. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=706.14s)]
*  And so if you have if all, you know, if your granddad told you stories about these things, you just like the boogeyman, right? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=711.26s)]
*  Like, you should be afraid of these things or you shouldn't do this or whatever. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=716.9s)]
*  You're like, yeah, you know, screw those guys or whatever. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=719.7s)]
*  But, you know, when you travel, man, it just like that ignorance gets gone. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=722.38s)]
*  And then it's kind of like you still see people hung in it because I go back like I went back to my I think my 10 year. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=726.5s)]
*  High school reunion and the people had been doing the same thing every day since I left. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=731.82s)]
*  And they might go to Panama City Beach for like vacation once a year, like we used to do on spring break. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=737.22s)]
*  But they're still kind of in that capsule. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=743.3000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? So that's one thing. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=745.86s)]
*  And that's another thing, too, I'm sure we'll talk about later. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=748.34s)]
*  But, you know, being a being a camp kid, like going to summer camp and being around kids of all different backgrounds and ethnicities and abilities. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=750.62s)]
*  And like that just opens you up for living with people for a week that you might not normally get to do in your own circles. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=759.2199999999999s)]
*  You know, like we're kind of limited to what our experience is, to what our environment provides. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=765.6999999999999s)]
*  And then if you don't make an effort to go get out and see the world, then you're kind of stuck in that thing. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=769.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, yeah, and it's kind of easy for it to happen for a lot of people, I think, when you come out of high school, because a lot of in a lot of places, there's a lot of tradition, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=775.3399999999999s)]
*  And it's like, OK, well, you kind of go to the same place, maybe your family win or something like that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=784.54s)]
*  And it's great. You know, I think tradition is super important. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=788.74s)]
*  But then sometimes you don't realize you can be stuck in some of the same like your area can get stuck in a lot of same traditional patterns, you know, of like of just thought. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=791.9000000000001s)]
*  You know, yeah, for sure. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=800.22s)]
*  But, yeah, I'm trying to think of like my first time when I would go to camp. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=802.22s)]
*  I think one thing that was good about camp was you would people came from other schools. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=806.3000000000001s)]
*  So it was like suddenly your world was a little bit bigger, right? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=809.7800000000001s)]
*  Even if they came from a different town, like I remember one time I met somebody and they told me they were from like a different place, had a different name in the town. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=813.62s)]
*  I was from it. I was like, what are you talking about? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=821.18s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that, like if you kept driving, you got to other places, you know, I just thought you would just, you know, you just got to the end of the street and there was just like this unwell kid out there yelling about deaf leopard all day. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=823.58s)]
*  You know, I didn't know you could really just go out into the world. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=835.9s)]
*  And you went to camp, you said? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=840.5s)]
*  Yeah, I went to camp and the camp that I went to and worked at as well was like an inclusion camp. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=842.18s)]
*  So you'd have kids in your group that might be on the spectrum and you'd have kids that come from like inner cities, like, you know, kind of impoverished areas. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=850.02s)]
*  And and then you'd have like rich kids that just sit around and play Nintendo all day. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=857.98s)]
*  And then you'd have, you know, all so you put everybody together. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=863.9399999999999s)]
*  And I remember like the transformer thing for me, there's just like a rope spiderweb. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=869.1s)]
*  Right. And you get there the first day and you're kind of a group of these kids and you're like, you're kind of talking to them or kind of not really. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=873.18s)]
*  You're like, you're not really down with them. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=878.78s)]
*  But the first activity you got to do is every single person has to be passed through this spiderweb without touching it and get to the other side. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=880.3s)]
*  So when you got to grab a kid, you know, bias cankles and pick him up and pass him through the thing after you do that, you know, it's like a low ropes course kind of activity. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=887.42s)]
*  But after you do that, then you that's kind of the best icebreaker because it's like nobody's ever like everybody puts two fingers underneath and lifts you up off the ground. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=898.14s)]
*  You're like you had never been picked up by other kids necessarily unless you might have been bullied or thrown around by him. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=906.66s)]
*  But it's like you got to get everybody through the other side without touching the spiderweb and then you can move to the next thing. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=912.18s)]
*  I've never seen this game. So this is a popular camp game. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=918.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like a camp activity, like an icebreaker. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=921.38s)]
*  But once you realize that, see the picture right there of him holding them up over their head. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=924.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you have to like pick kids up and pass them and hopefully don't drop them on their head. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=928.2199999999999s)]
*  But it's, you know, it looks very Egyptian almost based on this photo. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=931.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=937.18s)]
*  Yeah, we would like we wouldn't look at some kid went missing bus and we look for him for almost two months. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=937.62s)]
*  I remember. And they're like, well, that's camp. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=942.38s)]
*  And we're like, we find Jeremy, dude. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=944.74s)]
*  And they're like, whatever. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=947.5s)]
*  You know, when I was when I was a counselor, we had a girl. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=948.6600000000001s)]
*  So you end up being a counselor at that camp at that camp. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  OK, so that camp had a big effect on staff. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=954.7s)]
*  Yeah. OK. But I realized as a kid, like anybody that's really different than you from that point on, after you live with them for a week and you pick them up off the ground and you got to figure out touching somebody. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=956.62s)]
*  And you have to you realize like you're not that different. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=966.62s)]
*  It's just like people have different things like, you know, some of the kids that I worked with, I work with Special Olympics in high school, too. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=970.5s)]
*  And like, you know, some of the some of the kids that I work with that had Down syndrome, they were like the sweetest, most optimistic. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=975.9s)]
*  Like they just had a lot of parts of life figured out that mainstream kids maybe wouldn't. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=984.22s)]
*  Oh, so it's like, oh, once you're around that and you become a champion for those kids. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=990.22s)]
*  And so if somebody else is picking on somebody that's different, you want to like stand up because that's like your boy that you were in camp with. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=995.66s)]
*  Yeah. You realize in one week by dropping somebody into this situation. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1001.54s)]
*  Now they've been around all these different things. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1005.74s)]
*  And now now they're going to. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1007.9399999999999s)]
*  And also at camp, you get to be like courageous for the first time, you know, like everybody has to do a skit, right? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1010.14s)]
*  You got to get up on a stage and you have to like do a stupid dance or whatever, like whatever to make people laugh. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1016.18s)]
*  Oh, dude, I remember we had to do Michael Jackson. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1021.3399999999999s)]
*  Sorry to cut you off, but I'm not. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1023.9s)]
*  Did I interrupt you really bad? No, you're good. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1026.06s)]
*  OK, sorry, man. But I never I never forgot about this. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1027.78s)]
*  We had to do, oh, another one bites the dust. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1030.98s)]
*  Who is that? Queen, bro. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1034.6200000000001s)]
*  Almost Michael Jackson. And yeah, we had and I had never heard the song. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1037.14s)]
*  I didn't know what it meant or anything. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1042.46s)]
*  You know, I thought it was about drug use or whatever. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1044.26s)]
*  And but yeah, we had to get out there and dance in front of the other camp. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1047.02s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1051.06s)]
*  Yeah. And so and so if you just go get up in your class at school and do that, dude, you're going to get picked on forever. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1052.26s)]
*  But being in that environment where you can be kind of brave for the first time and other people are like celebrating it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1057.94s)]
*  And you you kind of learn to be a little bit more confident. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1064.3s)]
*  You learn about other people and different kinds of people. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1067.3s)]
*  And you learn. So I realized, like in one week of taking a kid and putting them in this and some kids like have a raw deal. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1069.78s)]
*  If they don't have any mentorship at home, if they don't have anybody that shows them how to be or how to treat people or why. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1076.02s)]
*  Or whatever it is unreal, then they leave camp with this new like there's like you were talking about, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1082.22s)]
*  like you just keep driving out of the town past the kids screaming about Def Leppard. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1087.74s)]
*  Like until you get out of that and you realize there's another world, then they look forward to coming back there the next year. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1091.82s)]
*  And that changes their mental capacity where they're like, hey, if I make the right decisions, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1097.54s)]
*  then I can get to a better place than where I'm at rather than just being stuck there and, you know, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1102.46s)]
*  watching people drink 40s and, you know, we're going to need everybody in the neighborhood. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1108.02s)]
*  Oh, God, yeah. People should not be allowed in some areas. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1112.3s)]
*  And I'm going to say it. They shouldn't be allowed to have sex within probably 90 feet of themselves. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1116.34s)]
*  That's a safe border, bro, because you have to land it perfect. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1125.7s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, you'd have to be up on a building to get it 90 feet to land in the right spot. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1128.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm not saying this well. I think they shouldn't be allowed to have sex. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1134.78s)]
*  I don't know how you would phrase it. We obviously need a legislator to help with this. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1138.74s)]
*  But yeah, I think, yeah, there should be like a life. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1142.22s)]
*  Yeah, we need some we need some better zoning, right. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1145.98s)]
*  And some genetic way talking about not breeding within 90 feet of where of where they're at. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1149.98s)]
*  Are you talking about actual physical touch of it? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1155.82s)]
*  Because that presented a whole nother problem to me. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1157.58s)]
*  It's like I got to figure out how to get with this girl. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1159.94s)]
*  It's like 30 yards away and succeed. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1162.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? There would definitely be a great form of birth control [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1166.6200000000001s)]
*  because the people that would actually hit the bullseye is going to be super small. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1169.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, maybe an archer, I guess. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1175.02s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, some other mean the lacrosse. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1177.22s)]
*  Yeah, that guy. Yeah. Oh, that guy would be messy, but he would get the job. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1181.42s)]
*  No, did you were just talking about something? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1188.3s)]
*  Oh, we were talking about like kids with Down syndrome and stuff, right? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1190.7s)]
*  So I was like. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1193.6200000000001s)]
*  Really humbled recently, I went on this show, it's called Beautiful Tasty Beautiful, right? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1196.38s)]
*  And the guys, it's these fellas, Sean and Marley, they're Australian, right? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1201.46s)]
*  One of them has Down syndrome, one of them, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1205.54s)]
*  I think is just like a cap of cig or something. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1210.42s)]
*  So here we are right here, right? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1214.42s)]
*  Go to that beer chicken right here. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1217.06s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of these guys, right? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1219.02s)]
*  Been a fan for years and so on. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1220.74s)]
*  When I was in Australia, I got to go to watch some of them cooking. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1221.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got to go do their show. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1225.3799999999999s)]
*  So, dude, here's the craziest part. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1228.06s)]
*  At the end, they're having a beer. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1229.62s)]
*  I can't drink, right? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1232.18s)]
*  That's because in my life, right, where I'm at in my life. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1233.98s)]
*  And I'm thinking to myself and the guys, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1237.1s)]
*  Molly's like, you know, have a beer. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1240.1399999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm trying to explain to him. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1242.3799999999999s)]
*  I was like, I can't. He's like, have a beer. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1244.9s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm like, I can't. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1247.54s)]
*  If I ever thought some of those was like negative about these guys, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1251.5s)]
*  they can drink beer. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1255.98s)]
*  I can't even they have Down syndrome. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1257.66s)]
*  I can't. And they can have beer. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1261.06s)]
*  Yeah. Like they're more reliable. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1263.82s)]
*  Yeah, they have crazy gifts, man. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1266.38s)]
*  Right. But it's like I can't even have a like that's the strata I'm on. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1269.78s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1274.78s)]
*  It's like when you are an alcoholic, you are outside of considered by society [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1275.42s)]
*  outside of the web of people that even have Down syndrome. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1280.3000000000002s)]
*  It's like, God, I was like, I just felt like such a lame. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1283.7800000000002s)]
*  Oh, man. But yeah, these guys are broke. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1287.8200000000002s)]
*  Unbelievable. Like I didn't even I don't even know if they have down. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1292.7s)]
*  They were so I was like, these guys are way cooler than most people [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1297.66s)]
*  I've ever spoken to. You know, it's like there's a there's a you find this [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1301.1000000000001s)]
*  with kids, too, that have been given everything. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1305.22s)]
*  And like maybe their parents don't pay attention to them or maybe they don't [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1307.1000000000001s)]
*  really whatever. But there's like a poverty of spirit that people have. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1309.58s)]
*  So it's like, you know, you can live in a nice house and have this or whatever. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1313.22s)]
*  But you don't really how to appreciate anything that you have. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1317.02s)]
*  But that's one thing with the people I've worked with with Downs, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1319.9s)]
*  like they have this incredible spirit about. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1322.6200000000001s)]
*  And it's like you can't teach that you can't teach that to mainstream kids [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1325.66s)]
*  that might not be able to do it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1329.6200000000001s)]
*  But it's kind of infectious when you get everybody in the same group. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1330.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1334.02s)]
*  So we'd have like two kids that are on the spectrum or have Downs and come from [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1334.58s)]
*  the part of camp called Sparrowwood, which I worked at that spot also. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1338.9s)]
*  Sparrowwood, Sparrowwood. OK. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1341.86s)]
*  And I was on staff one full summer living at Sparrowood, like different group [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1344.98s)]
*  in every week. And I have two campers and I'm responsible for for having them [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1348.18s)]
*  shit showered and shaved and ready to like come join everything. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1351.54s)]
*  And you never know what it was going to be. But so you start off as a as a as a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1355.02s)]
*  as a camp attendee. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1359.46s)]
*  And then you how many years and you get count. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1361.46s)]
*  And then I started counseling. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1363.7s)]
*  I was 15 and actually a year earlier than I was supposed to. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1365.18s)]
*  And I counseled till I was 17. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1367.5800000000002s)]
*  OK. And then for three years, every time I lived the whole summer [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1371.5s)]
*  at camp working as staff. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1375.22s)]
*  So living there, different group coming in every week for nine weeks [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1377.1000000000001s)]
*  or 10 weeks out of the summer. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1380.3400000000001s)]
*  And what that taught me about myself was invaluable. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1382.22s)]
*  Like, you know, I learned more about me than than I ever thought that I would. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1386.38s)]
*  But so that was the thing when I was like 14, I was like, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1391.62s)]
*  I want to play music and I want to build a camp. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1395.58s)]
*  Like, that's what I wanted to do. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1399.7399999999998s)]
*  So I wanted to my impact that it had on me made me want to dedicate my life [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1400.8999999999999s)]
*  to building a place that does the same thing that I kind of experienced. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1405.3799999999999s)]
*  So like a summer camp. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1410.54s)]
*  Yeah. Summer camp. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1412.02s)]
*  And then we do, you know, we built an amazing campus. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1413.3s)]
*  It's called Camp Southern Ground. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1415.62s)]
*  You have a camp now. Yes. Camp Southern Ground. Yes. OK. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1417.7399999999998s)]
*  Yep. Wow. Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1421.26s)]
*  So so you're able to make this happen. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1422.9s)]
*  What happens with music? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1425.5s)]
*  And you have to obviously stop being a counselor once music got busy. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1426.74s)]
*  Yeah, I had to stop being staff. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1430.58s)]
*  But then I was like my dream. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1431.82s)]
*  Well, first of all, was to be a successful musician, like just get to where [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1434.34s)]
*  because I worked at I worked at this place in the long and not far from the KKK [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1437.54s)]
*  these house called the wagon wheel. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1441.42s)]
*  And it was like a catfish fry house place. Right. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1443.26s)]
*  And I watched I watched dishes there. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1446.1s)]
*  So when you take a whole pan of catfish grease and you lay it in the dishwasher [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1448.7s)]
*  and you have one of those sprayers, you grab the handle, bro, and you spray that, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1452.3s)]
*  dude, 80 percent of it gets on your face. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1455.14s)]
*  And so I was washing dishes in this catfish fry house place for like months. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1458.14s)]
*  And I was like, there's got to be something better than this. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1463.98s)]
*  You know, food was good. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1467.66s)]
*  Oh, the food was good. Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1469.06s)]
*  Fried catfish and hush puppies and all the shit. But [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1470.5800000000002s)]
*  and then I clean the grease machine at the end of the night. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1475.18s)]
*  You got to filter all the grease and then take the filter, put this filter on there [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1477.8999999999999s)]
*  that has all the cracklings and all the stuff in it. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1481.54s)]
*  And then you spray that, bro. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1483.3799999999999s)]
*  And it's like so I would come home like half soaking wet, driving my granddad's [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1484.5s)]
*  old like Oldsmobile or whatever it was had the blue like plush seats, like giant [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1489.06s)]
*  ass heavy door. Like when you shut that door, it was it was like you could hear it [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1494.06s)]
*  two blocks away. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1498.5s)]
*  Oh, it was like when the tomb opened for Jesus, some of those doors. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1500.1399999999999s)]
*  It was like when you open it, it was the same thing. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1503.02s)]
*  But I would come home being soaking wet and like I wear glasses back then, too, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1506.1s)]
*  bro. So I have it because of the grease. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1509.58s)]
*  I had a nose because I couldn't see. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1511.6599999999999s)]
*  I had bad. Who would let a guy who can't see go into a dang grease? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1513.62s)]
*  And I mean, it kept it out of my eyes, but I definitely wore the catfish on my face. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1516.9399999999998s)]
*  And then I worked as a cook at McDonald's for a while, too. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1520.74s)]
*  I was grilling at McDonald's, bro. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1523.1799999999998s)]
*  Really? And they were they did they have a grill at that time? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1524.9399999999998s)]
*  Or what's the actual it's a flat griddle thing. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1527.8999999999999s)]
*  And then you put them into a warmer, you know, but [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1530.06s)]
*  I got fired from McDonald's because I had this manager at the time and she would [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1533.02s)]
*  her boyfriend would come up in like a blue five. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1536.5s)]
*  Oh, Mustang. And with this, you know, he had the hair. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1538.54s)]
*  He had the whole thing. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1541.3799999999999s)]
*  And she'd fill up a whole bag full of fries for him, just like a whole scoop [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1542.3s)]
*  and throw it out the window to him or whatever. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1546.8999999999999s)]
*  So one day every hour they throw away all the sandwiches that we made. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1548.4199999999998s)]
*  Right. So every hour it's got to go in the trash. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1552.78s)]
*  So I was taking a chicken sandwich that was going to be thrown away. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1554.46s)]
*  And I and my buddy was there. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1558.06s)]
*  He's walking in and he was like, I'll eat that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1560.1s)]
*  And I was like, cool, I slid it across the counter. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1562.54s)]
*  I wasn't trying to hide it or whatever. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1564.54s)]
*  So I got fired from McDonald's with possibility to rehire. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1565.6599999999999s)]
*  I wanted to do the whole first of all. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1570.1799999999998s)]
*  That sounds like something that happens in a prison system, dude. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1573.26s)]
*  It's like with possibility of parole. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1578.1s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's a chance you're good. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1580.1s)]
*  You can come back. Yeah. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1581.86s)]
*  And what was it? A McFish? Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1583.86s)]
*  Oh, it was it was a McChicken. Oh, McChicken. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1585.86s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's better. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1588.4599999999998s)]
*  If you slide a McFish to somebody, first of all, you're obviously a dirty sorcerer. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1589.7s)]
*  OK, because who even eats McFish? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1594.5800000000002s)]
*  Except sometimes your mom does. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1596.78s)]
*  When your dad left, that's the only person that ever ate a McFish. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1599.22s)]
*  Rock bottom sandwich. Oh, it's so sad. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1602.7s)]
*  My mom would get it sometimes. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1604.5800000000002s)]
*  And every even times were hard for her then. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1606.06s)]
*  Right. Times had never been easy for my mother. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1608.5800000000002s)]
*  And and and the wrapping paper on it was a little different. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1611.14s)]
*  It had a little more adult yellowish color. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1617.1000000000001s)]
*  It was a little more pastel than like the kind of electric kind of the color of agony. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1619.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was a little bit. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1625.06s)]
*  It had. Yeah, it just had more. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1626.1000000000001s)]
*  It had been through a little more. Right. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1628.26s)]
*  You know, it had been recycled maybe. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1630.1000000000001s)]
*  And I would see my mom get the McFish and I'd be like, oh, things aren't going to go well at home. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1632.66s)]
*  You know? Yeah. But that's life, man. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1636.78s)]
*  But yeah, I can't believe you work with them. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1639.9s)]
*  And then did you hope to get rehired or what? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1641.5s)]
*  How did? No, I was pretty much after after cleaning grease and then doing McDonald's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1644.82s)]
*  and everything, I was like, I don't want to smell like old food anymore. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1649.14s)]
*  You know, and I was like, there's got to be a better way to do it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1652.5400000000002s)]
*  And me and my buddy in high school. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1655.3400000000001s)]
*  So we were singing together. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1657.1000000000001s)]
*  He's my best friend. And dude, his family is the stories of his family, bro. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1661.1000000000001s)]
*  Like you would not even believe some of the stuff that his [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1665.18s)]
*  seven brothers and sisters, all their names start with are all of them [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1669.9s)]
*  have seven letters in them, all of them. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1672.5s)]
*  But like the life story behind all of them, dude, that's a whole episode [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1674.1000000000001s)]
*  of like three hours of talking about the stuff that happened with his family. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1677.54s)]
*  But really unbelievable. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1680.62s)]
*  But he was my boy. And so we sang together and we had a quartet in high school. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1683.06s)]
*  So we sang like barbershop, right? Yeah. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1686.94s)]
*  There were three guys that could sing in choir and the other dudes were just in [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1689.18s)]
*  there because their girlfriends were in there and they were tone deaf and couldn't [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1692.26s)]
*  sing. So we'd have like we do literary meets and compete against these kids [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1694.98s)]
*  that are like everybody can sing. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1698.74s)]
*  One dude can sing like bass, like a grown ass giant man. Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1700.7s)]
*  And then but we always had one dude that was awful. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1705.02s)]
*  Like me and my two best friends in high school, Tyler and Rafford, we would all [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1708.94s)]
*  sing together and we could lock in. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1712.3s)]
*  But that we always had one dude that was awful. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1715.1s)]
*  And we never had one other dude that could ever sing that was in choir. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1717.62s)]
*  So we always had like it was like the bad leg on the chair. Right. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1720.06s)]
*  So that was me and Rafford sang like coffee houses and stuff together. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1725.42s)]
*  And, you know, and you have a little band at that point. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1730.58s)]
*  It was just me and him just playing guitars and singing. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1733.46s)]
*  And that was when... Were you a good guitarist? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1736.5s)]
*  I would practice, man. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1738.74s)]
*  My brother took me to a bluegrass festival when I was 10 and they had like a [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1739.78s)]
*  guitar competition where kids would compete against each other. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1743.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. And there were kids that were like eight years old dude that were just [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1746.42s)]
*  ripping the shit out of the guitar. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1749.5800000000002s)]
*  And I was like, fuck, if that kid can do that shit, I can too. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1751.14s)]
*  So I would go sit on my porch in Dahlonega and practice. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1753.8200000000002s)]
*  Isn't it crazy how seeing something that's it's like, it's so crazy, the value [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1756.94s)]
*  of getting to see something like even if you're talking about whether it's another [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1762.1s)]
*  culture, a skill set, you know, I remember the first time I saw somebody do [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1765.4199999999998s)]
*  something, I was like, damn dude, I could do something. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1770.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's just like was it's unbelievable. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1773.1399999999999s)]
*  Or if somebody takes you to see like, yeah, oh, this guy plays music and then he [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1775.54s)]
*  show you like that's how little seeds get planted. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1779.06s)]
*  But it really is. It's like it sounds ridiculous, but that's just the way it [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1782.7s)]
*  works. I remember that a guy showed me how to do one day I was at the I was at [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1786.58s)]
*  summer camp. So we go to just YMCA camp and it was good, you know, but it was just [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1791.62s)]
*  a lot of people that would get hay fever and we'd all be like kind of in one [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1797.06s)]
*  building, you know? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1800.1799999999998s)]
*  And so I think it was just kind of safest way for the city to have us be in the [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1801.4199999999998s)]
*  summers because yeah, it was back before they had like Claritin or whatever. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1805.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. And your eyes would just, you know, you would just like, yeah, and just [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1809.58s)]
*  just weren't doing too good out there. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1816.58s)]
*  And they give you a soccer ball, be like 97 degrees. You can't even see. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1818.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1821.86s)]
*  Moldy. Like you see the first summer camps I went through super early. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1822.74s)]
*  Like you'd be in a cabin that didn't have any air condition and it's like Georgia [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1826.1s)]
*  in the summertime. It's like, you know, you'd have the old denim mattresses. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1830.1399999999999s)]
*  You remember those like they had like denim pattern on them, like stripes on the [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1834.58s)]
*  mattresses and they're all moldy and like the pillows are moldy and there's no [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1838.1399999999999s)]
*  thing. So the first the first four days you just get used to sweating. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1841.86s)]
*  Yeah. And then about day five or six, you kind of get used to it and then it's [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1844.78s)]
*  time to go home. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1847.86s)]
*  Dude, isn't there something nice though about there's something nice, like [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1848.9399999999998s)]
*  sometimes I'll be on vacation and the place I'm staying at won't have air [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1853.26s)]
*  conditioning. And it's the first night it's kind of like pain in the butt the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1856.58s)]
*  second night, but then you almost get like in sync with the universe a little [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1860.82s)]
*  bit. Like I feel like my dreams pick up and like, I feel like I'm a lot more in [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1865.2199999999998s)]
*  tune with things when I get to that point. Does that make any sense to you? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1870.34s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. We adjust. That's one thing. It's weird. I think that's why our [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1873.6599999999999s)]
*  immune systems go nuts is like humans because we're made to live out and [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1877.22s)]
*  freezing cold or super hot or be scraped up. Like all that stuff builds our [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1881.26s)]
*  immune system. So when we sit inside at like 72 degrees every day, all day, and [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1884.9s)]
*  then something hits our system, then it's like the faucet turns all the way on [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1890.18s)]
*  because it doesn't really know what to do. Right. You're just like, you don't [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1893.9s)]
*  have an iPad. So your system thinks it's just time to make your nose run off [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1896.98s)]
*  like, you know, all the way down onto your down your pants. But it's like, we're [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1900.98s)]
*  made to adjust and adapt to those things. So like being uncomfortable is [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1906.98s)]
*  actually what makes us like our systems like work right. Yeah. In a way. Yeah. I [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1910.58s)]
*  got to do better. I think I can do, I don't want to like be upset at myself [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1915.26s)]
*  about it, but I think I can do a little bit better at trying to be a little more [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1919.22s)]
*  uncomfortable at times with a lot of things for me. It can be in a [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1921.9s)]
*  relationship. It could be like George Kittle was on here and he talked about [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1925.66s)]
*  how he goes and gets in his ice bath every day first thing in the morning. And [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1929.54s)]
*  I'm like, you are a person from the beginning of time, you know, like you're [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1932.5s)]
*  not doing well, George. But he, um, he's just like, I like to start my day off [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1938.1s)]
*  with something that's uncomfortable. You know, Mike Tyson, I just heard him [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1942.66s)]
*  talking about it in an interview about like that's cause that's the only way you [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1945.74s)]
*  start to see what fear is. And you start to get a little look at fear. You might [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1949.98s)]
*  just think, Oh, I don't want to do this. But really a little bit of that's fear. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1953.78s)]
*  And he's like, and that's how you start to get to work with fear. I just thought [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1957.14s)]
*  that was kind of interesting. Um, have you heard that the flavored air category is [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1960.54s)]
*  quickly becoming the fastest growing alternative to vaping and smoking? Well, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=1965.34s)]

*  Fume fills the void for me, ditching a bad habit that you can leave, but you [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2009.94s)]

*  this porch and then the sun glow motel was across the street. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2280.7799999999997s)]
*  So we'd go get in their pool shower and like take a shower and, um, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2283.7799999999997s)]
*  sleeping out of the van. And I remember this is like, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2288.3799999999997s)]
*  we're just trying to make ends meet, right? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2291.5s)]
*  Like just make enough money to buy something to eat, you know, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2293.06s)]
*  just to be able to hang out. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2295.2999999999997s)]
*  So it didn't cost anything to sleep on the porch of this house. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2296.2999999999997s)]
*  And I remember they were giving away barbecue Doritos. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2299.02s)]
*  That was when the, the, that flavor just came out. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2301.4199999999996s)]
*  And if somebody was walking down the beach and giving out sample bags and he was [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2303.8599999999997s)]
*  like, dude, do y'all want these? I don't want to have to hand them all out. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2306.7799999999997s)]
*  So he gave us a case of Doritos bro. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2309.42s)]
*  But I was like somebody giving you a million dollars back then. Cause it was like, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2311.06s)]
*  dude, that's like a dollar a bag times whatever for us. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2314.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Probably 36 bags. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2317.5s)]
*  And all I had was a gas card. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2319.02s)]
*  So we get white bread and baloney and mustard and natural light. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2320.7000000000003s)]
*  And that was our diet, bro. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2325.7400000000002s)]
*  But then we added Doritos to the sandwiches and that changed the game. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2327.9s)]
*  We got three. Yeah, dude. Welcome to France. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2330.86s)]
*  So while I was swimming out in front of this sun glow motel is right on the [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2335.34s)]
*  beach, you know, right at this abandoned house, I was swimming. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2338.42s)]
*  And I met these older ladies that were out there and I was like walked up to them. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2341.58s)]
*  They were just standing out in the surf. And I was like, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2345.54s)]
*  what are y'all thinking about out here? Whatever. Ended up making friends with them. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2347.58s)]
*  Their mom owned a bad-ass house that was down the road on Roberts drive. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2351.38s)]
*  And they had a garage. They had a bed in it and a bathroom and everything. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2356.3s)]
*  So we made friends with these people and it was Muriel and JB Ellis was their [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2360.1s)]
*  names and they were, they were super old. She was like, probably [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2363.26s)]
*  79 or 80 at the time. And he was probably 76. He wasn't at home first. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2368.02s)]
*  So it was just her, but she just like led us in her house and they had a bad ass [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2372.7799999999997s)]
*  like stereo system and 9 million bottles of liquor everywhere. You open the cabinet. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2376.98s)]
*  It was full of liquor. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2380.58s)]
*  So this is a senior citizens home you guys are in now? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2381.42s)]
*  This, yeah. This end. So she was like, oh yeah, y'all can stay here, whatever. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2383.66s)]
*  And so we were looking for, so we had a place to stay, right? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2389.38s)]
*  So now we had air conditioning and this bad-ass house. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2391.82s)]
*  And basically if you want to come in and have drinks with them or whatever, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2393.98s)]
*  and they go out dancing, they go to like this place called salties and they'd get [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2396.58s)]
*  up and dance and shag and get down, you know, but super amazing people. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2399.54s)]
*  But I was wondering what the husband was going to think. Like, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2403.7000000000003s)]
*  she just brought in two stinky dudes, two stinky youths, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2406.62s)]
*  van youths. Okay. At a motel pool. Okay. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2412.06s)]
*  Just okay. Who have luckily come into 36 bags of Doritos. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2417.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we had a big second Doritos bro. Yeah. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2423.1800000000003s)]
*  So we were worried about him coming home and you know, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2426.66s)]
*  we hung out with her for like a few weeks or whatever. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2429.82s)]
*  And we'd sit and play music for him in the house and he finally came home and he [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2431.9s)]
*  was cooler than she was. They were both just amazing dude. So, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2436.3s)]
*  and they supported us. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2440.42s)]
*  So then we found out there was a new restaurant that had opened that was run by [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2441.34s)]
*  the Israeli mob. Oh yeah. And it was called Joey's and [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2444.7400000000002s)]
*  called America. It was about one of their guys that their, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2449.82s)]
*  their brothers that had died or whatever, they named it after him. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2452.34s)]
*  But this was down right on front beach road, you know, and, um, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2455.34s)]
*  so we got to, we got to get, we auditioned for them and we set up on the deck. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2460.82s)]
*  They had a little, you know, outdoor deck and we played outside. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2464.42s)]
*  And that was the audition. That was the audition to play for them. Right. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2467.7000000000003s)]
*  So we set up and we played and they're like high fiving each other, whatever. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2470.46s)]
*  They drove Lexuses. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2473.58s)]
*  They had the like Gucci belts and the slick back hair and all the things. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2474.54s)]
*  But we started playing and they loved it. Like they were like high fiving each [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2479.38s)]
*  other, whatever. So they gave us a chance. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2482.42s)]
*  So we played the first 10 nights for 150 bucks a night for six hours a night. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2484.62s)]
*  So that was our first gig at this place, Joey. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2491.06s)]
*  So we did the 15 or the 10 nights in a row, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2492.98s)]
*  we made 1500 bucks and we were like fucking poor rich. Oh, you know, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2495.34s)]
*  I went and bought some new sketches, bro. I was like, yeah, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2500.1400000000003s)]
*  I think he bought some Doc Martens by some sandals or whatever. Yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2503.7000000000003s)]
*  And so we ended up like, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2507.7400000000002s)]
*  so then we ended up keeping the gig there six nights a week. So we, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2508.7400000000002s)]
*  and then after that I negotiated to get 300 bucks a night. Let's talk business. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2511.38s)]
*  So then this dude from Illinois, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2514.98s)]
*  this mattress salesman dude was in the bar one night and he's, he was, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2517.2200000000003s)]
*  he looked a little bit like John Candy, but more awkward and more really weird. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2520.54s)]
*  He'd get really drunk and put his hat on backwards and roll his sleeves up. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2524.26s)]
*  And like he was, he was interesting, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2527.1800000000003s)]
*  but he just had a brand new condo and he's super lonely cause he's pretty awkward [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2530.54s)]
*  dude. Right. So he let us move in his condo. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2534.78s)]
*  So we were living in a brand new condo now. That's like middle beach road, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2537.46s)]
*  just one road off the back there. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2541.42s)]
*  And we slept on air mattresses and like we were making cash and like doing what [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2543.54s)]
*  we're doing. I remember calling my dad and like being like, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2548.02s)]
*  I got a job or whatever. And he's like, go, you know, go, go do it. You know, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2550.38s)]
*  dad, I'm living with an older guy from Illinois. You know, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2554.34s)]
*  exactly. If you need a magnetic mattress pad, I got the guy now. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2556.98s)]
*  Wow. So, and so we just climbed that ladder in Panama city, bro. We were, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2561.7400000000002s)]
*  we were doing good, but we were grinding dude, six hours a night. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2565.54s)]
*  And then we played from eight till two in the morning. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2568.46s)]
*  Well, it takes so long, especially then when you think this before social media, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2571.38s)]
*  Oh, a hundred percent. Then it's, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2576.38s)]
*  think about the only way for something really to travel. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2577.94s)]
*  You know, people had to tell you, Hey, you got to hear about these guys. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2583.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, unless you got to, you know, through the gates to radio play. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2586.7s)]
*  And we were set up there playing six nights a week, six hours a night. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2591.06s)]
*  And we did that for, you know, the whole summer. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2594.1s)]
*  And then we go back to Atlanta and I played some bars in Atlanta. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2596.66s)]
*  And so we did a circuit for like, and so I had to create a business model, right? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2600.42s)]
*  This place didn't have live music. So if I, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2603.94s)]
*  if I had grown up in Nashville and I was like trying to go get a gig for 60 [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2606.42s)]
*  bucks a night to play somewhere, I wouldn't have been able to survive. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2610.06s)]
*  So what I did, I go to sports bars, like a wild wings, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2613.74s)]
*  they didn't have live music. And I say, you know, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2616.66s)]
*  I'm going to come play here every Wednesday night and I just want the door. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2618.54s)]
*  Right. So it didn't cost you anything to have me here at first. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2622.06s)]
*  Like let me, let us come in and prove ourselves. Give us a tab, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2624.2999999999997s)]
*  like give us like a hundred dollar tab. And so we come in and play there, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2626.62s)]
*  but fuck after like six months, dude, on a Wednesday, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2630.2599999999998s)]
*  we'd have 300 people coming on a Wednesday night and I was making five bucks at [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2633.58s)]
*  the door. So we were making bank then. So, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2637.46s)]
*  so we did that three nights in Atlanta, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2640.34s)]
*  two nights in Panama city and two nights in Birmingham every week, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2644.86s)]
*  every week, all like seven days a week for a long time, six days a week. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2648.58s)]
*  I had to hire a dude from Mississippi state, like this old football player, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2652.7s)]
*  dude, who'd get bad road rage, man. Really? Was it TJ Malwany? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2656.9s)]

*  dude. I hired him just to, just to hang with us and drive. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2664.1s)]
*  So I'd sleep against the window in my truck. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2666.64s)]
*  I had my brother co-sign with me to get like a 1500 Silverado, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2668.38s)]
*  like a red, like the mini extended cab, like the little baby extended cab. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2672.86s)]

*  So we were like stepping up, right? We were out of the good times van, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2683.58s)]
*  which got like four miles to the gallon, bro. It's like, it was, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2686.54s)]
*  so we graduated. That's a big step. Yep. That's a big step up, man. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2690.2999999999997s)]
*  And we could get around and we were just hustling, man. But six years, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2694.1s)]
*  we grinded like that for six, six years, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2697.8199999999997s)]
*  just like playing the same house gigs in three states, just grinding, grinding, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2700.06s)]
*  selling those CDs for five bucks a piece and then gaining tip money and whatever [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2705.1s)]
*  drugs people would throw into the tip jar at the end of the night, you know. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2708.98s)]
*  And at that time, did you, were you like crossing paths with other musicians? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2711.98s)]
*  Like trying to think of Jason Morazz was coming out. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2715.78s)]
*  I think he might've been out of, or like, um, John Mayer, he was out of Georgia. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2718.26s)]
*  Was there any, like, did you cross paths with any of those? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2723.1s)]
*  There was nobody in these circuits because the places we played, no one, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2725.3s)]
*  they never had live music. So I didn't know, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2727.98s)]
*  I didn't know there were like a rule or way anybody else did it. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2730.82s)]
*  I didn't know how anybody else did it. Cause we just fucking created it ourselves. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2733.62s)]
*  So we didn't know like what we're supposed to do. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2737.22s)]
*  Cause we just figured out something that worked for us, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2739.18s)]
*  but we add value to the places. Cause if you own a restaurant, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2741.62s)]
*  like if you make bank on a Wednesday night, that's all okay. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2744.5s)]
*  Cause you lose your ass through the week and then Friday, Saturday, you make it up. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2748.18s)]
*  So, um, you know, these places were stoked. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2751.2599999999998s)]
*  And I remember when we had outgrown playing the sidelines up in, uh, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2754.5s)]
*  Kennesaw, Georgia, we'd outgrown it and it was time and we moved on to like [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2758.42s)]
*  playing theaters and playing, you know, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2762.1s)]
*  honky tonks and stuff like that, like bigger places. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2763.94s)]
*  The manager when I left because they were making good money there, the owner, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2766.62s)]
*  whatever left me a voicemail and I saved it. It's one of my old phones, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2769.5s)]
*  but it was like, after all I've done for you and all this shit and whatever, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2772.54s)]
*  I hope you fail. And I, and I saved that voicemail and it's just, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2776.22s)]
*  it's just funny, but what a negative kind of outlook, huh? Well, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2781.66s)]
*  he was making a lot of money off of us, man. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2786.06s)]
*  He could have just thought also, man. Yeah. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2788.34s)]
*  I'm glad for you guys or whatever, but I guess, yeah, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2791.02s)]
*  maybe that's usually that made it even more like kind of entertaining to us. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2793.1400000000003s)]
*  And also just like, you know, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2796.54s)]
*  I didn't know where I was going all new is that I just wasn't going to quit. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2798.3s)]
*  But it got, you know, it's that law, like 10,000 hours, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2801.46s)]
*  whatever you do for 10,000 hours, you're going to get good at it. Right. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2804.98s)]
*  So plan so many nights, so many hours, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2807.46s)]
*  but I also taught me the appreciation of like loving all the people, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2810.02s)]
*  like the dudes cleaning up the bar or the, the, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2813.7000000000003s)]
*  the waitresses and whatever it is, like I was connected to those people. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2815.82s)]
*  They became like family in those places. So for me, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2819.06s)]
*  just treating people good was like that. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2822.82s)]
*  It taught me to like those people are sometimes the only people listening to [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2825.38s)]
*  you at the end of the night when you're playing, you know, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2828.54s)]
*  cause I play some shitty gigs, dude, like the worst, really? Oh, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2830.14s)]
*  the worst, like no one there. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2835.06s)]
*  You drove eight hours to go play a show and you set up and it's just like, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2836.82s)]
*  you know, do you ever play during a fight and fights breakout and you have to [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2840.82s)]
*  keep playing. Yeah. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2843.34s)]
*  And I've had to join fights like in the middle cause friends are involved in it [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2844.7s)]
*  really in the middle of why? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2848.26s)]
*  Because y'all don't have a good percussionist. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2849.6200000000003s)]
*  Dude, there's, there's some stories, man. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2853.42s)]
*  The amount of bar fights you've seen when you play in bars for 10 years is a lot [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2856.42s)]
*  and your friends are bartenders and stuff like that or whatever. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2860.0600000000004s)]
*  And you'll see some shit about to go down. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2863.1800000000003s)]
*  There's like three dudes that came in from one of the nights. So this is a Dixie [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2864.5800000000004s)]
*  Tavern, right? So I ended up, was it in Jackson? It's in Georgia. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2869.1400000000003s)]
*  It's in Marietta, Georgia. Okay. Um, so I don't cop Parkway. Um, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2872.7000000000003s)]
*  you're right where the brave stadium is now, the new brave stadium is right down [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2876.98s)]
*  the road from there, but that was where I cut my teeth. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2879.66s)]
*  So as we got out of that circuit of like Panama city, Birmingham or whatever, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2882.02s)]
*  then we started playing around, uh, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2885.2599999999998s)]
*  Atlanta more often and I had like three or four house gigs around Atlanta and [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2887.74s)]
*  actually talked them into building the stage that was in there cause they didn't [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2892.5s)]
*  have loud music. So they built the stage and we would play there. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2895.1s)]
*  And one of the nights these two dudes from Miami had come in, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2899.3399999999997s)]
*  like one tall skinny dude and one kind of heavy dude. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2902.9s)]
*  And so one of my buddies was bartending at the time and ended up having words [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2906.62s)]
*  with him or whatever. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2910.42s)]
*  And so the tall skinny dude called one of the female bartenders who was married [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2911.1800000000003s)]
*  to another bartender that was there, a different guy, um, a really bad word, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2915.7000000000003s)]
*  called her the C word. And so it was off. And so the bouncers, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2920.1800000000003s)]
*  so you know all the bouncers, you know, like nobody's, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2924.1800000000003s)]
*  you're not going to get skull, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2928.1800000000003s)]
*  you're not going to get curb stomped cause nobody's like looking out or whatever. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2929.7799999999997s)]
*  So it was a little safer place to fight. You know? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2933.02s)]
*  And then we had off duty friends, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2935.66s)]
*  off duty cops that would come in and hear us play and stuff like that. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2937.06s)]
*  So they're, they're about, so they, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2939.54s)]
*  we come in and I remember this, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2942.14s)]
*  this night especially because somebody had given me like a little chocolate [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2944.86s)]
*  mushroom, right? So it's like, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2948.18s)]
*  so it's like right before like two or three songs before the end of the, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2950.9s)]
*  of the, the night, right? So I ate a little piece of chocolate, right? So, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2954.74s)]
*  whatever. And so we get done playing the song or whatever, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2958.2200000000003s)]
*  and things getting a little HD, you know, it's looking good or whatever. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2961.1400000000003s)]
*  And then these two dudes from Miami, um, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2964.7400000000002s)]
*  called her that name and the bouncers are trying to throw them out or whatever. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2967.6200000000003s)]
*  And one of my buddies has the big one kind of, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2970.78s)]
*  he's got his arm pushed up on his neck, hold them against the wall. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2973.06s)]
*  And this other dude, this tall skinny one who I think he's on meth cause he was [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2975.94s)]
*  crazy strong. So he's like swinging at everybody. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2979.1000000000004s)]
*  So when I was in college, I did judo at West Georgia. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2982.5s)]
*  So this dude swinging at everybody, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2986.14s)]

*  and just trying to hit somebody, right? So he, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2991.22s)]
*  he's turning around, he swings one of my buddies and misses whatever. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2995.62s)]
*  So I get on his back, I get him in a rear naked choke, right? And I'm, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=2998.22s)]

*  So I've got this dude and I remember the feeling of his warm neck, right? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3004.94s)]
*  And so then I was, I was bigger than I was probably like two 50, you know, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3008.94s)]
*  I was bigger boy. No, just, I mean I was strong, but I was, I was not thicker. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3012.7s)]

*  He'd like this. And so there's a planner, a brick planner, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3059.1s)]
*  that's right outside Dixie Tavern. This dude fell like a tower, bro. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3061.9399999999996s)]

*  hypothermia in there, bro. I was all by myself. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3095.9s)]

*  He told the cops that he hit the dude and knocked him out and he hit the thing. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3139.7s)]
*  So I was off the hook or whatever, but that was like, that was a wild trip. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3143.7s)]
*  So, so this dude's on the ground. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3147.2599999999998s)]

*  cause they didn't touch him cause they thought his neck was broken or whatever. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3152.9s)]
*  He woke up and he runs to this bush. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3155.7s)]
*  Cops are all out there at this point, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3157.8599999999997s)]
*  it runs out to this bush and starts shuffling around in this bush and cops are [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3159.66s)]
*  fucking pulling out their guns and shit and whatever. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3162.7s)]
*  The dude pulls a gun out of the bush, grabs a gun and the cop fucking knocks it [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3164.62s)]
*  out of his hand, grabs him, puts him in cuffs and all this shit or whatever. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3168.94s)]
*  But that dude, that dude was close to pulling that thing out and shooting, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3171.7s)]
*  shooting somebody. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3176.14s)]
*  But he could have shot somebody earlier if he hadn't had that opportunity to [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3176.94s)]
*  ride on his back. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3180.78s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. He, that was, that was wild, bro. But there's, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3181.5s)]
*  there's a lot of nights like that, that I've had playing in bars. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3184.58s)]

*  that's kind of the most dangerous time. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3197.42s)]
*  It's that weird time when the bar is like, you know, it's kind of closed. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3199.46s)]
*  People are like, if they've been talking to a girl, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3203.54s)]
*  they're trying to get in their last words or something. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3205.54s)]
*  It's almost like the final round of like a dating show. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3207.82s)]
*  Someone's violently drunk. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3210.58s)]

*  face in the corner somewhere. He finally shows back up. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3222.54s)]
*  So I'll never want my kids to work in a restaurant or a bar cause I've seen all [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3225.94s)]

*  And what happens after all that and like what people do to keep bartending and [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3231.78s)]
*  drinking shots, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3235.7400000000002s)]
*  like nobody can drink a thousand shots a night without doing a bunch of blow. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3236.6600000000003s)]

*  I wasn't, but there, as soon as I saw that the first time, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3249.5s)]
*  then I started seeing it everywhere. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3252.42s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3254.3s)]

*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3261.5s)]
*  It's like the first time you see somebody do coke and you're like, Oh, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3262.94s)]
*  I see everybody doing this everywhere. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3265.14s)]
*  People aren't just kind of casually touching each other's hands like that in the [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3268.2999999999997s)]
*  bar for no reason. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3271.22s)]
*  Yeah. Well my bass player early on, um, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3272.2599999999998s)]
*  I get done playing him and people come up and go, Hey man, let me holler at Donnie, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3276.06s)]
*  you know, or let me, let me holler at Jimmy or whatever the dude's name was. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3279.7s)]
*  And I was like, why do you need to holler at him? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3283.02s)]
*  And so it turns out he was dealing blow at my shows. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3286.54s)]
*  So I had to, I had to, I had to fire him. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3291.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3293.5s)]
*  He could play fast though, bro. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3294.7s)]
*  He could play fast dude. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3296.1s)]
*  And, uh, and I had no idea this was happening, right? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3298.7s)]
*  So I let go, but that's how I met John Hopkins. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3300.7799999999997s)]
*  He was the first guy that was in my band that I have now. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3302.94s)]
*  John Hopkins. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3306.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3307.62s)]
*  And I'm the lymphoma guy. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3308.02s)]
*  Is it the same, same name? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3309.2599999999998s)]
*  It is John, John Hopkins. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3312.2599999999998s)]

*  Oh, the, uh, I met him at, um, Jimmy, uh, Jimmy John's. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3314.34s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3318.9s)]
*  You guys played a special event there. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3319.46s)]
*  So Hopps, Hopps, Hopps, the first one that was in my band, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3321.78s)]
*  but I was recording with him and I told him about my bass player and he was like, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3325.14s)]
*  well, I can play a little bass. I can sit in. So, you know, in February, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3328.18s)]
*  it'll be 20 years of him sitting in, but he's one of the best singers, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3331.54s)]
*  dude, best fucking background singer period. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3336.18s)]
*  But he had a band called brighter shade, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3338.54s)]
*  which is like this kind of heavier metal band that was badass. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3339.9s)]
*  He could scream and, you know, was legit. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3342.86s)]
*  So, um, that was the beginning of the band that I have now. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3345.54s)]
*  He was the first member, uh, coming into that. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3348.54s)]
*  But because it wouldn't have happened if my bass player had been dealing blow. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3350.94s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3354.3s)]

*  Right? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3632.74s)]
*  So you have people that are in your band that could do all this amazing shit and [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3633.14s)]
*  you want to, and you want to show them off, man, you want to let them do what [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3636.06s)]
*  they're best at and let people see that, you know, but I think what I'm good at [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3639.4599999999996s)]
*  is just figuring out how to make that accessible. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3643.22s)]
*  Like being able to just like, find the things that I feel like are going to be [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3645.1s)]
*  the most impressive they can do and just letting them do it, man, letting them do [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3649.74s)]
*  their thing, you know, that's, that's really what makes our band special is the [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3652.62s)]
*  musicianship of the people that I have. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3656.46s)]
*  My everybody in my band is a ninja man there and I create things. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3658.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not really like a theory guy. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3662.22s)]
*  I was, I definitely had my party days when I was supposed to be studying theory. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3663.62s)]
*  Cause I went to West Georgia, uh, university. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3667.46s)]
*  I went there on a voice scholarship to sing classical music. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3669.98s)]
*  But then my roommate that I was with when they put me there in the dorm was this [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3673.7s)]
*  dude that smoked weed every five minutes from Tennessee. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3677.86s)]
*  So I'd never been around that really. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3681.1s)]
*  I saw it twice in high school or whatever, but then this dude, and then [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3682.98s)]
*  he's just in there puffing, and then there was acid around and then there was [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3686.1s)]
*  all this shit. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3690.7000000000003s)]
*  So I was supposed to be learning about theory and music, but I never, I never [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3691.3s)]
*  liked the rigidity of that. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3695.5s)]
*  Like you can turn music into math, but it's not that to me, like I want to [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3697.78s)]
*  make you feel something. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3701.1400000000003s)]
*  So I got all these amazing people in my band that can tell you, Oh, here's the [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3702.7000000000003s)]
*  math, right? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3706.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3707.02s)]
*  Like my bass player can listen to a song and write the chart for it as he [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3707.3s)]
*  listens one time down all the notes, the timing, the thing just, but that's not [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3710.6200000000003s)]
*  you. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3714.54s)]
*  That's not me because I don't, I want to be able to try to transcend a feeling. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3715.1800000000003s)]
*  And then they can tell us what the math is and they'll make a chart and then [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3721.38s)]
*  everybody can play it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3723.86s)]
*  Like I can play a song for him on my guitar and then he gives it to my band [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3724.7000000000003s)]
*  and they have a chart. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3728.02s)]
*  And then the first time we ever play it, it's a song like everybody playing on it. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3728.82s)]
*  But I, I never had a class in school that taught me how to use my creativity. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3732.22s)]
*  Never had a class ever. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3739.54s)]
*  It's all copy this shit. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3740.74s)]
*  Copy what Beethoven did copy, what Mozart did copy Bach copy all these things. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3741.8599999999997s)]
*  And it's like, what would it have been like for me if I'd had a class that was [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3745.58s)]
*  like, here's how you write a song. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3749.54s)]
*  Here's how you take what you feel and put it in something like that. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3751.22s)]
*  Like it was never, there weren't classes for creativity. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3754.4199999999996s)]
*  There was art class. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3757.18s)]
*  You can make some shit with some strings or like string some macaroni and shit [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3757.98s)]
*  together. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3761.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3761.58s)]
*  Or make a dude. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3762.58s)]
*  We had a class one time we had to make, this was insane. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3763.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, casts, right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3766.4199999999996s)]
*  Like body cast or whatever. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3770.02s)]
*  And they had one, uh, girl put hers on it. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3772.3399999999997s)]
*  Didn't take it off for like 14 weeks, dude. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3776.02s)]
*  This lady, everybody at a certain point forgot that we'd even made it for class. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3778.7799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3782.2999999999997s)]

*  People thought you was handicapped for like three months, dude. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3784.54s)]
*  I bet it smelled awesome in that too, bro. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3788.1s)]
*  I will say that. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3791.2999999999997s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3813.5s)]

*  So that was like a big bucket list thing for us. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3824.74s)]
*  Cause like, I'm still just a music fan. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3826.74s)]
*  So like getting to hang out with people that were heroes to me musically, like [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3828.7s)]
*  musicians that I love were like superheroes, but they're real life, you know? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3833.34s)]
*  And so if you run into them somewhere, you're like, oh my God, they're Superman. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3837.38s)]
*  There's, you know, whatever it is. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3840.42s)]
*  So for me, that, that was some of the craziest milestones for me when we started [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3841.46s)]
*  having success and going as like, we're just chilling with our heroes, you know, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3846.8599999999997s)]
*  and playing on stage with them and you get to be friends with them. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3851.02s)]
*  And then it's, that's even more weird. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3853.42s)]
*  It's like, somehow appear with it, but then you realize that they're just normal [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3854.98s)]
*  dudes too. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3859.06s)]
*  And then it's like, and the greatest ones are always the coolest ones, man. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3859.7799999999997s)]
*  They're always just like down to earth and cool. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3863.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3866.2999999999997s)]
*  Like I know you guys had this song for about Jimmy, that was kind of in the [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3867.02s)]
*  Jimmy Buffett vein recently, you know? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3869.3799999999997s)]
*  Um, did you got, did you have a relationship with him ever? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3871.98s)]
*  Yeah, I was good friends with Jimmy. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3876.98s)]
*  Um, he was, he was a mentor for me and he was, he was incredible, you know, and [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3878.54s)]
*  I've had him on some of my songs too. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3883.74s)]
*  We had a song knee deep and we did, he was on the same boat. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3885.18s)]
*  We did a version of that with him just a few years ago. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3887.46s)]
*  Um, but there aren't many people that I could call and ask certain questions to [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3889.94s)]
*  that could give you like a real answer to that question. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3894.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3896.5s)]
*  I'm sure it's like you, your friends that are big standup comedians and people [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3897.06s)]
*  like that, that understand the lifestyle that you live, that have done it and done [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3901.66s)]
*  it on such a big level and built an amazing brand. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3905.06s)]
*  Um, you know, we did crossroads with Buffett too, when, um, when, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3908.42s)]
*  Oh, that's we first got going. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3913.22s)]
*  Um, but yeah, Jimmy, Jimmy was, here's the kind of guy Jimmy was. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3915.46s)]
*  One of my buddies was trespassing on his property, fishing, standing on the rocks [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3919.5s)]
*  on the back of his place in Key West, fishing on the thing. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3924.14s)]
*  Jimmy saw him out there. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3927.02s)]
*  They're like watching a game inside or something. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3927.98s)]
*  Jimmy walks outside to where the guy is and says, you need this kind of lure. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3930.06s)]
*  Gave him a lure and it's like, and you need to throw it over there. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3935.3799999999997s)]
*  And then he went back in his house. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3939.18s)]
*  So he didn't kick the guy out for fishing in the back of his yard. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3940.8599999999997s)]
*  He's like, let me help you succeed at what you're trying to do, even though [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3943.3399999999997s)]
*  you're trespassing on my place. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3946.74s)]
*  Cause the guy wasn't there trying to like, mess with him. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3948.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3950.7s)]
*  But that's, that's a good example of, of Jimmy and his spirit, man. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3951.22s)]
*  He was such a, such a baller and dude in the seventies, he was a gangster, bro. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3955.14s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3959.8199999999997s)]
*  Gangster, like flying drugs from Cuba and fucking had operations, flying [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3960.58s)]
*  shit in his plane. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3965.3399999999997s)]
*  I wish I could do it. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3967.18s)]
*  Dude, Mack Mackinally told me a story. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3968.14s)]
*  They were flying, I think he said from Jamaica or somewhere and they, they had, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3970.8599999999997s)]
*  they didn't have a seat in the plane for one of the roadies, right? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3976.14s)]
*  So they gave him an eight ball in trade for letting him ride where the luggage was. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3979.06s)]
*  Cause they were just flying a couple hours to get to where they needed to go, but [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3984.7799999999997s)]
*  they needed to get him there and they ended up picking up somebody else that needed [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3987.54s)]
*  to sit inside. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3990.94s)]
*  So they're like, look, bro, if you ride where the luggage is, man, here's a, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3991.54s)]
*  here's an eight ball. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3994.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3995.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3995.58s)]
*  If you'll sit back over here with this, uh, some, uh, uh, Samsonite. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=3995.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4001.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4002.2599999999998s)]
*  So he's, he's in the, he's in the cargo bay, right? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4002.9s)]
*  So the plane, the plane takes off and the dudes cruising in there. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4005.46s)]
*  And, but they didn't tell that dude, they had to land real quick to clear security. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4009.58s)]
*  So the plane takes off and then it lands again, like in 20 minutes, right? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4014.02s)]
*  And then he's looking out the crack in the fucking door. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4018.66s)]
*  Cause he's in the luggage bay and he sees dudes walking with fucking machine [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4021.9s)]
*  guns and shit outside. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4025.5s)]
*  So the dude's like, fuck, they're going to catch me with these fucking drugs in [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4027.38s)]
*  here. So the dude just toots the whole fucking bag. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4030.02s)]
*  Sorry, dude. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4033.58s)]
*  Go on. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4034.86s)]
*  Snort the whole fucking eight ball eats it, whatever he does, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4035.58s)]
*  fucking down the, down the hatch, bro. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4038.34s)]
*  And then the plane takes anybody. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4041.3s)]
*  And then the plane takes off again and it's in the air for like an hour and a [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4043.1s)]
*  half. Right. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4046.62s)]
*  And Max said when they landed dude, and they opened this luggage compartment that [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4047.8599999999997s)]
*  this dude crawled out of there and he looked like a bruised banana. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4051.5s)]
*  This dude had been fucking tweaking in there, getting bashed by a roller [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4054.5s)]
*  suitcases and shit. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4058.74s)]
*  Like, you know, not a lot of oxygen or whatever. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4059.9399999999996s)]
*  Pull up that tick tock and that Bayer getting out of that all coming out of [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4068.18s)]
*  hibernation, dude. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4071.18s)]
*  You seen this deal? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4072.6200000000003s)]
*  This bear, I think it just got out of hibernation. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4074.5s)]
*  Beautiful animal. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4077.34s)]
*  He's like Ron White getting up out there. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4083.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that looks like Ron White after some good ayahuasca. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4089.6600000000003s)]
*  God, he just lost a sideburn right there, shaking it out. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4095.1400000000003s)]
*  God, dude, that's fun, man. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4101.18s)]
*  That's fun, bro. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4104.42s)]
*  Stories, man. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4105.7s)]
*  That's a great story. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4106.58s)]
*  And one of my buddies, his dad went to prison for a long time, helping with one [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4107.780000000001s)]
*  of those operations that he had. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4112.22s)]
*  And so for 20 years, Jimmy raised him. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4113.780000000001s)]
*  And so, um, and then he ended up being like the artist that made all the stuff in [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4116.5s)]
*  the Margaritaville is like built the planes that were crashed into the things, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4121.740000000001s)]
*  painted it all, did it or whatever. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4124.780000000001s)]
*  Like that whole, like there's a world in Key West that Jimmy was, you know, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4126.22s)]
*  responsible for. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4131.02s)]
*  And once you know the local people there and you know the people, like it's such [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4132.22s)]
*  an extraordinary thing. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4135.38s)]
*  And so when Jimmy, when, when I heard that Jimmy was about to pass and his, his, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4137.38s)]
*  his main guy had texted me and said, he's about to exit the stage. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4142.1s)]
*  Um, that hit me hard because I realized like all of his crew, all of his family, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4146.02s)]
*  all of his business, everything, there was this whole. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4153.02s)]
*  That was there and it hit me hard, man. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4156.3s)]
*  I was at home and I, it was like midnight or something. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4158.700000000001s)]
*  And I got up and I had to walk around and I started writing. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4161.700000000001s)]
*  I just had to write. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4164.3s)]
*  I had to like, cause I felt that whole, you know, if something happens to me, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4165.14s)]
*  there's a lot of families that depend on me to be solid and me to be there. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4168.58s)]
*  And then without me there, there's all of these things that are necessary. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4173.3s)]
*  I can't do without them, but they can't do it without me the way that it is, the [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4176.62s)]
*  way that it's set up. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4180.46s)]
*  So it's like, man, I just felt this whole there. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4181.3s)]
*  And I, and that's when I was writing about it all. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4184.66s)]
*  And, um, and ended up meeting up some other guys that had started a tune and, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4186.66s)]
*  and that's, we wrote this last one called pirates in Paris, but that's about. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4191.78s)]
*  Jimmy that's about, you know, saying goodbye to him and what he created. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4195.46s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, I was listening to this yesterday. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4199.7s)]
*  Um, wow, man. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4203.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4207.38s)]
*  It's, uh, that's so crazy to have one of your heroes become a friend. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4207.66s)]
*  And then they are gone. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4214.099999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's just like, I don't know, life gets scared of me like that. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4217.38s)]

*  I just got a couple of bird houses. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4390.22s)]
*  So I'm sure that nature is going to be flaring up back there a little bit more. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4393.7s)]
*  What do you consider success now? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4398.1s)]

*  You've gotten to have a lot of like commercial success, you know, like [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4401.860000000001s)]
*  what do you think about success? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4404.78s)]
*  Man, my, my, my first main thing is my family, man. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4405.900000000001s)]
*  My kids, you know, just, just showing up and being there for them. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4409.5s)]
*  Uh, I get them half the time and I'm a waspin. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4413.34s)]
*  So I live 10 minutes away from, from, uh, from their mom and we just rock [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4416.5s)]
*  co-parenting together and, um, but when I have my kids, man, and it's, it's, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4422.099999999999s)]
*  it's a great thing. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4426.219999999999s)]
*  It's just like humbling and whatever. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4427.3s)]
*  Cause I'm basically like the house bitch when I'm home and I'm there to help, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4428.7s)]
*  like take them to school and, you know, pick them up and, and hang with them. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4431.58s)]
*  And I just, that's my first priority is making sure that the time I have with [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4435.74s)]
*  them is like the greatest that it can be. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4439.46s)]
*  So that's half my life. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4441.179999999999s)]
*  And the other half is like, I tour, I adventure out spearfish. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4442.7s)]
*  Um, you know, I bow hunt. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4447.86s)]
*  Um, I do things that really fulfill me, but it's really about just being out in [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4450.86s)]
*  the wild, cause that's, that's what refills my cup, man. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4455.34s)]
*  That's what makes me feel like if I'm doing something that's so engaging with [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4457.7s)]
*  me with that, I have to, there's no other chatter, you know, I don't have any [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4462.22s)]
*  noise that's happening or whatever. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4465.0199999999995s)]
*  So success for me means like obviously being there for my kids and then trying [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4466.42s)]
*  to be creative, trying to still write good songs, trying to take care of [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4471.66s)]
*  myself, take care of my body. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4474.38s)]
*  Like I want to be able to do that stuff when I'm super old, you know, investing [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4475.78s)]
*  in it, like being a little uncomfortable every day will save you from being [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4480.34s)]
*  uncomfortable and miserable your whole life from being all bound up and, and [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4483.98s)]
*  not feeling good. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4487.86s)]
*  So yeah, I didn't want to call it. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4488.82s)]
*  I didn't want to, but I did. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4491.5s)]
*  But that's, that's what, that's what it takes, man. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4492.62s)]
*  But, but you know how you feel and you kind of get momentum in those areas [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4494.54s)]
*  where you feel good. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4497.5s)]
*  So anything that I can do, I work with an amazing like regenerative medicine doctor. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4498.38s)]
*  Um, and he he's got me on a good like peptide regimen. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4503.02s)]
*  I take NAD, I take, um, I do IV every month with exosomes in it, which is like, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4507.82s)]
*  Really? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4513.78s)]
*  Were you telling me about this? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4514.7s)]
*  I think so. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4516.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4516.78s)]
*  Were you telling me about exosomes? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4517.46s)]
*  So basically stem cells create exosomes when they're like, go to an area to heal [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4518.74s)]
*  things, but they have, oh, it helped your shoulder. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4521.9800000000005s)]
*  Were you telling me that? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4524.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4525.26s)]
*  Completely healed my shoulders up. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4525.900000000001s)]
*  Um, getting some stem cells and getting things like that. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4527.42s)]
*  Like, you know, there's a lot of controversy around stuff like that for people, but. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4530.22s)]
*  You know, you can't argue with results, you know, and you find people that you can [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4534.82s)]
*  trust and they're like, Hey, I think you should try this. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4538.02s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4540.06s)]
*  Um, exosomes are extracellular vesicles generated by all cells. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4541.1s)]
*  Uh, and they carry nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4546.18s)]
*  They are mediators of near and long distance intercellular communication in [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4550.58s)]
*  health and disease and affect various aspects of cell biology. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4555.78s)]
*  So I don't know what that means. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4558.7s)]
*  Keeping your cells really healthy. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4559.86s)]
*  And, um, dude, I've noticed for my voice, like once a month I get an IV, they draw [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4562.0199999999995s)]
*  blood, they do testing on me and stuff. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4567.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they give me about six vials of those little exosomes, man. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4568.98s)]
*  And dude, that thing it's like, and what can you, you can't put them in like a [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4572.9s)]
*  vape pen or something, can you? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4575.86s)]
*  You can put them in a nebulizer actually, and you can inhale them in a nebulizer [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4577.06s)]
*  form that way for your voice. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4581.3s)]
*  But you can, you getting them, getting them this way, um, has made my voice [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4583.42s)]
*  stronger, man. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4588.34s)]
*  So I just want to be able, when I'm like 80 years old, dude, I don't want to [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4588.98s)]
*  look like I'm 80, man. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4592.58s)]
*  I want to feel good. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4593.5s)]
*  I want to be able to run up and down mountains. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4594.5s)]
*  I, you know, I want to be able to pole vault, you know, just the things that are, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4596.179999999999s)]
*  you know, the normal 80 year old people can't do. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4601.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I love that, man. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4603.259999999999s)]
*  Now that's a good definition of success. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4604.9s)]
*  You know, being able to spend time with your kids, being able to, um, still be [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4606.9s)]
*  active and do the things that you want to do. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4611.34s)]
*  You know, I think that's a, it seems like a really good definition to me. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4613.34s)]
*  Um, Oh, tell me about this. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4617.26s)]
*  So one thing I'm thinking, why do you sometimes bands do covers and sometimes [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4619.3s)]
*  they don't, some of this may seem like novice level questions to you, but I just [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4622.42s)]
*  am curious about that because sometimes audience members like do a couple more, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4627.900000000001s)]
*  you know, but then sometimes they're like, ah, that's too many. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4631.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4634.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4634.78s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4635.78s)]
*  I, I love other people's music so much that when we get to like reinterpret it [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4636.34s)]
*  and do it our way, like I love every show that we play, we're going to play three [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4640.7s)]
*  or four cover songs, at least, you know, because it's kind of like tipping the [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4644.34s)]
*  hat to people that you really love and does something. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4647.9s)]
*  And also you can read the crowd, man. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4651.1s)]
*  When you start playing it, you start a good cover and they know it's coming [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4653.58s)]
*  and they're just, they start going crazy. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4656.26s)]
*  Like I love that, but I love trying to do it in a different way, like trying to [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4657.94s)]
*  figure out some way to like make it special, make it your own. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4661.86s)]
*  And I think that comes from me just being a music fan. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4664.94s)]
*  It's like, you know, I got three hours to keep these people engaged. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4666.94s)]
*  Like what, what can I do mixed in with our songs that are going to make it like [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4670.54s)]
*  the best night possible, you know? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4673.78s)]
*  And so every time we come to a city, we have new covers that we worked up to do. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4675.78s)]
*  So we don't get the same show twice. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4679.98s)]
*  You know, it's competitive, man. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4682.179999999999s)]
*  It's like, if people are going to buy our ticket and the next time we come [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4683.219999999999s)]
*  buy our ticket again, you can't be half drunk on stage. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4687.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't be, you know, slurring and whatever. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4690.099999999999s)]
*  It's just a waste. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4693.099999999999s)]
*  It's like, you don't respect those people enough to give them everything you got. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4693.9s)]
*  So for us, it's like, we're like athletes. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4697.58s)]
*  Like we, we go after it. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4699.58s)]
*  Like we're going to be ready, bro. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4700.7s)]
*  We're going to come back and we're going to give them every inch, you know, even [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4702.86s)]
*  if it's two, that's all you got, man. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4706.42s)]
*  Hey, that's a lot in some regions, you know, fruit by the foot. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4708.98s)]
*  Um, do you have to ask another band before you play their cover or not? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4716.98s)]
*  No. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4721.259999999999s)]
*  Once the song is released, you can cover it, record it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4721.66s)]
*  You can do whatever you want with it. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4724.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4725.54s)]
*  Um, but sometimes we'll get hit by those people. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4725.9s)]
*  They're like, I heard this cover, like James Taylor sent me a, a text and was [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4728.58s)]
*  like, we did a sweet baby James and he sent me, uh, like a text and was like, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4732.5s)]
*  great job on, you know, sweet baby James, but he talks in license plate things. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4739.26s)]
*  So he'll, he'll text you like nine letters. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4744.14s)]
*  And if you read them, it sounds like a sentence. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4746.34s)]
*  So he texts me like that. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4748.740000000001s)]
*  And it's like, it takes me a while to figure out what he's saying, you know, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4750.46s)]
*  cause he talks in license plate letters sometimes. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4754.58s)]
*  Oh, he does. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4756.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4757.740000000001s)]
*  And just like acronyms or something. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4757.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4760.740000000001s)]
*  But it's, it's, uh, you know, it's, it's like B as you are, you know, B B S U R [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4761.54s)]
*  or you are in, in ML, like you're an animal. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4767.14s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4771.62s)]
*  Those kinds of things. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4772.58s)]
*  And it's kind of a thing he does. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4773.54s)]
*  And then he told me that he has a song. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4774.62s)]
*  He has a song called B as you are. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4776.18s)]
*  And literally the whole sentence of the chorus is all a license plate thing. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4778.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4783.5s)]

*  It, I did. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4979.26s)]
*  Sorry if it's an uncomfortable question. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4980.9400000000005s)]
*  You don't have to answer it. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4982.26s)]
*  I did, but it was one of those things I didn't, I didn't want to, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4983.14s)]
*  it's one of those weird things as a man where you feel like you can't leave and [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4989.46s)]
*  you can't stay and you can't because of pressure and things that you put on your [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4994.22s)]
*  self, like the kids that know what it means, you know what I mean? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=4998.5s)]
*  Like they don't know what kids don't know what it means that you're getting a [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5001.42s)]
*  divorce, whatever it is. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5004.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5006.14s)]
*  And so yeah, that, that part. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5006.62s)]
*  And so knowing that it's leaving the wake of those types of things, but knowing [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5008.900000000001s)]
*  whatever, but I had, I had a couple of friends of mine that had, that had, uh, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5012.38s)]
*  taken their own lives and it made me realize like that ain't ever going to be [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5015.9800000000005s)]
*  me, man. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5021.26s)]
*  I got caught in that space and not knowing what to do. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5021.900000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5024.3s)]
*  And one of the things that I realized was that I was, I was, I was, I was [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5024.78s)]
*  like, yeah, and whatever was eating at them that they couldn't face it enough [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5027.94s)]
*  to like get out of the situation, regardless of whatever judgment it may [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5031.179999999999s)]
*  cause, regardless of whatever it is, man. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5034.259999999999s)]
*  So for me, that was like a sign that I saw of like, okay, I gotta get, I gotta [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5036.419999999999s)]
*  get out of this or whatever, but the, the place that it put me in and even my own [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5042.0199999999995s)]
*  choices through the last few years of it, like before that happened and things like [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5045.58s)]
*  that, like just darkness and coming out of it and feeling like, you know, I, I [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5049.74s)]
*  can't be like this anymore. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5055.98s)]
*  And it was weird cause I'm not one of those people that goes and like gets my [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5057.82s)]
*  cards read and shit like that, but I ended up getting my cards read at some [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5060.139999999999s)]
*  lady in LA, like some older lady who read my cards and was like, show me a picture. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5063.62s)]
*  And it was like, is a card that had like a nice house and a lawn and like kids [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5069.299999999999s)]
*  running around. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5073.66s)]
*  It's like, this is what your life looks like from the outside to other people. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5074.179999999999s)]
*  But that's really not what it is. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5079.299999999999s)]
*  And if you don't get out of this, you're going to get a serious physical illness [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5081.82s)]
*  and you're going to die. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5084.66s)]
*  So if you don't, and I felt that because I'd carried around all this weight and [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5085.5s)]
*  guilt and shame and shit. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5089.94s)]
*  Like it felt like someone was squeezing my heart. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5091.34s)]
*  Like a hand was around it, like physically felt like it was clamped down on. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5094.34s)]
*  And I could, I could feel that. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5099.38s)]
*  And I was just, so I came out of that and just like, whatever, whatever it takes to [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5100.74s)]
*  get to the other side of this river that I'm in right now, that's just beating my [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5105.86s)]
*  ass right now. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5109.3s)]
*  I got to keep swimming. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5110.38s)]
*  I got to get to the other side of it. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5111.34s)]
*  And then, and then I got to figure out what's going on with me. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5112.78s)]
*  Like, what do I, what do I need to do to be there solid for my kids and to be [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5116.58s)]
*  there for their mom and like to, to provide and to be able to do those things. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5122.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, what can I do to try to get myself on track where I feel like find myself [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5125.179999999999s)]
*  again? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5131.099999999999s)]
*  Cause I think in the middle of it, in the middle of the codependency around all of [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5131.38s)]
*  it, I lost who I was around all of the stress that was around that and all the [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5134.42s)]
*  businesses and all the other shit. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5139.7s)]
*  It was literally like just taking fire from all sides. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5141.06s)]
*  So coming out of that, I can't even just, I can't even, it sounds like a lot. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5144.620000000001s)]
*  It's, it's hard, man. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5150.06s)]
*  And it takes a, you know, it takes a lot of grace, but you find out who in your [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5151.42s)]
*  circle, like is really there for you and who really wasn't there, but was around. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5154.34s)]
*  And then, but coming out of that, man, I was like, I want to, I, you know, I [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5158.580000000001s)]
*  quit drinking the year before I actually got divorced, just to, just to be clear. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5163.820000000001s)]
*  You know, I wanted to be clear and know exactly what was going on and see the [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5169.26s)]
*  thing. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5173.1s)]
*  So that was, you know, six and a half years ago and I had to get clear and I [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5173.42s)]
*  had to see the pattern and see what was going on. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5179.02s)]
*  And I realized that it wasn't going to work. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5180.780000000001s)]
*  And like, the only way out of this is through it. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5182.3s)]
*  So just go through it and do it. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5184.42s)]
*  Was it hard to go through it? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5186.46s)]
*  Is it hard to go through something like that with grace? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5187.54s)]
*  Like, how do you do it in best honor your partner, like your spouse and stuff in [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5189.46s)]
*  it? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5193.58s)]
*  Cause it sounds like that was something you took into consideration. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5193.66s)]
*  Yeah, you have to, I just had to ask her, you know, what do you [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5195.9400000000005s)]
*  want? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5198.94s)]
*  What do you, what, you know, obviously other than us not, you know, getting [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5199.379999999999s)]
*  along, like, you know, what, what do you need? [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5203.9s)]
*  And just what she asked for, I gave her and just did my best to try to do that. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5206.339999999999s)]
*  And it's taken time to heal the relationship and things. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5209.98s)]
*  And she's an amazing lady, you know, and I'm blessed to have her as the person [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5212.58s)]
*  that, you know, that helps raise our kids and to have that, like a solid human to [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5216.82s)]
*  be there to, to help me to do that. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5222.099999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I'm, I'm grateful. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5223.86s)]
*  I mean, I'm grateful for everything. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5225.74s)]
*  In the rear view, everything hard that's happened has like served us somehow. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5227.0199999999995s)]
*  It's just really hard to see it at the time, but I came out of that phase of my [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5230.42s)]
*  life, like wanting, okay, what can I do to make myself be better, feel better? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5234.46s)]
*  I did like three years of plant medicine journeys. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5239.38s)]
*  I did, you know, lots of therapy. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5241.94s)]
*  I, I anything that I could do to try to just like shed these feelings, you know, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5244.62s)]
*  shed this like weight that I carried around and like reprogram my belief system, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5250.9s)]
*  reprogram myself so that I could be present. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5255.38s)]
*  And so I could be, I could find my love for myself and for my creativity and for [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5257.78s)]
*  these things again. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5262.62s)]
*  So where has been the last six years? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5263.46s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5265.860000000001s)]
*  Where, um, yeah, where did you go try plant medicine at? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5267.34s)]
*  Did you go to other country? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5271.900000000001s)]
*  I did. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5274.18s)]
*  Um, I've done it in different places. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5274.900000000001s)]
*  Um, I, I. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5277.26s)]
*  What's something you learned from it? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5281.06s)]
*  That might be a better question. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5282.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5283.66s)]
*  Cause I've done it a few times and I've learned some pretty cool stuff or things [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5284.0199999999995s)]
*  that I have been helpful for me. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5286.9s)]
*  I hired a life coach and I worked with her for six months, like intensively. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5288.5s)]
*  And you know, she incorporated the plant medicine into our program. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5293.5s)]
*  So because I had some experience with those things before, it wasn't just a [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5297.5s)]
*  normal thing. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5301.66s)]
*  We started off the six months, like day two of doing it with a psilocybin journey. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5302.0599999999995s)]
*  And it was the most transformative of anything that I've ever done. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5308.259999999999s)]
*  And it was like a hero's dose, like seven grams. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5313.139999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5316.299999999999s)]
*  Like all the board. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5317.099999999999s)]
*  And like an hour into that, I was like seated in a chair and I had to revisit [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5319.82s)]
*  lots of things and I had to breathe my way through a lot of things. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5325.42s)]
*  Cause there's like subconsciously there's things. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5328.42s)]
*  What was, what was the most amazing to me is the intelligence that exists that [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5331.299999999999s)]
*  the psilocybin has finding our trauma. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5335.94s)]
*  Cause it found it, bro. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5340.78s)]
*  It found it and like subconsciously working through pulling that stuff out. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5341.9s)]
*  Like there's moments where it sucks and you gotta breathe through it and you [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5345.259999999999s)]
*  gotta take and stay in gratitude. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5347.98s)]
*  Like if you're in a mental space where you're ready to accept whatever it [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5349.9s)]
*  shows you, like good, bad or ugly, whatever it is, and just, and stay in [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5353.58s)]
*  gratitude, even for like the painful parts of it, then you can stay in [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5357.78s)]
*  gratitude if you're mentally in a place to do it. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5361.46s)]
*  I think it's the most transformative thing that I've ever done. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5363.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5365.66s)]
*  I had, after that journey was like five hours long and I came out of that with [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5366.0599999999995s)]
*  more gratitude than I could hold in my face, dude, like tears rolling out of my [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5370.5s)]
*  face and I had visited like my children being born again and I had seen, but I [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5374.02s)]
*  had that bowling ball that I carried around in my chest and in my gut after [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5378.3s)]
*  that five hours, that whole like 40 pound ball of shit was gone. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5381.94s)]
*  Really? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5387.94s)]
*  It was gone and it hasn't been there since then. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5388.74s)]
*  And I got to do something. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5391.34s)]
*  It was, it was the most transformative out of everything that I've done. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5393.22s)]
*  I've, I've, I've done cambo as well. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5396.58s)]
*  Oh, have you? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5399.18s)]
*  That you've done toad as well. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5400.58s)]
*  And that's like 20, not smoking it, but like they burn you with the vine that [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5402.38s)]
*  comes from the area and then they put your, you mix your saliva with the venom [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5407.26s)]
*  and put it on and it makes, as soon as they put that on bro, your hands feel [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5410.34s)]
*  like they're vibrating, like the fastest you've ever felt anything in your life. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5413.98s)]
*  Like the minute it touches, it's like, and then that's only last like 20 minutes. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5417.94s)]
*  So you can like read through the uncomfortable part of that, but that's [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5422.46s)]
*  like a spiritual and, uh, you know, physical detox as well. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5425.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5429.06s)]
*  Booby. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5429.5s)]
*  And then I, and then I went to Peru and I did a, I was a journey in [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5430.1s)]
*  Peru for 10 days, a diet, uh, God, 10 days. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5435.5s)]
*  So every second day you would take the medicine and you're out in the jungle [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5439.5s)]
*  and being connected there with you. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5443.9800000000005s)]
*  And I took one of my boys, Jake, one of my best friends, you met him the other day. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5446.26s)]

*  He's just one of my favorite people. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5459.06s)]
*  Um, but he went with me and, but you're isolated. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5461.02s)]
*  So they put you in these tambos. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5464.5s)]
*  So you're, you're by this river, like big muddy river and you, dude, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5465.820000000001s)]

*  It's not a Hampton. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5472.54s)]
*  No, you, you take, you take a big boat up to, you know, a thing, your car goes [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5473.22s)]
*  on a, on a ferry across the river over a thing, and then you get in a boat, like [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5478.22s)]
*  a Panga, a long one where you're all lined up, like 13 of you in a row with [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5481.700000000001s)]

*  And I was like, I've never done it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5518.9400000000005s)]
*  They're like, you chose this to come as your first thing, but I was, I was open [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5519.9800000000005s)]

*  So you basically have a little hut. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5534.26s)]
*  It's about as big as this part of this roof right here. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5535.5s)]
*  And then there's a hammock and then there's a bed with a little mosquito net [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5538.46s)]
*  and a little desk, like a one chair and a desk. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5541.860000000001s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5544.18s)]
*  Who's the desk for anybody? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5544.820000000001s)]
*  Or it's just a, no, it's just, that's your spot. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5545.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5548.02s)]
*  So in about every like 300 yards down the river, there's another one. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5548.34s)]
*  And so you have your own place. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5552.26s)]
*  And so for 48 hours, you're just sitting in this thing, chilling. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5553.580000000001s)]
*  I mean, you can get out and walk around the jungle or can you go talk to a neighbor [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5556.780000000001s)]
*  you stay by yourself, you don't talk to anyone until you gather every other day [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5560.700000000001s)]
*  for the ceremonies at night. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5565.26s)]
*  Um, so you're basically, and these, these people, I'll be like walking by [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5567.42s)]
*  there's dudes in like full linen shirts and pants or whatever, meditating for [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5571.82s)]
*  like eight hours a day, just sitting there, just like breathing it up or whatever. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5575.9s)]
*  And I'm like, thank God I brought a guitar cause there's no phones. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5579.46s)]

*  Um, and you drink this tea. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5592.5s)]
*  It kind of makes you sleepy, which was great. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5594.66s)]
*  Cause I would just nap the day away. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5596.66s)]
*  And then I napped the first day, like super hard. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5598.38s)]
*  And the second day I was like probably the most well rested I've been in a long time. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5600.34s)]
*  And then I couldn't really nap anymore. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5604.66s)]
*  And then I was like trying to like figure out what the deal is. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5606.22s)]
*  Cause I brought like some Laura bar, some stuff to like snack on, you know what I [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5609.46s)]
*  mean? And I was like, there's no way I'm going to be starving. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5612.34s)]

*  You know, and it's like, man, I just really loved it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5732.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5738.9s)]
*  So here's what happened. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5739.14s)]
*  So the first couple of ceremonies were like positive ones. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5740.0199999999995s)]
*  The third ceremony, um, it was the hard one, like the death of ego one where you're just [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5743.34s)]
*  like, you know, and I didn't know you're supposed to interact with this being or this [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5748.860000000001s)]
*  thing that you're experiencing when you're in there. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5753.26s)]
*  And the people didn't tell me that. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5755.38s)]
*  So after that night, cause I was like, it just beat my ass the whole thing, but [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5756.18s)]
*  something weird that happened. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5761.06s)]
*  Uh, my dad like appeared in one of my visions I was having, and I went to put my hand on [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5762.58s)]
*  his shoulder and he vanished. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5769.38s)]
*  And I had this like weird feeling like something was wrong. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5771.259999999999s)]
*  So we get through the ceremony that night. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5774.46s)]
*  It was, it was a tough one. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5777.0599999999995s)]
*  I spend the night, I get up first thing in the morning and I'm thinking [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5778.66s)]
*  something's wrong with my dad. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5781.0199999999995s)]
*  So I hike out in the river, which is muddy. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5782.74s)]
*  And you know, I'd been getting a bucket. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5784.9s)]
*  They give you leaves that smell a little bit like garlic that you put in a bucket. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5786.86s)]
*  So you take the bucket and get some water. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5791.42s)]
*  No, but you use them as like soap. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5793.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5795.54s)]
*  You scrunch them up and then you smell like body odor and garlic at the same time. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5795.82s)]
*  I remember one night I was doing the ceremony and I had a tank top on bad idea. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5799.9s)]
*  And I remember putting my arms over my head and just smelling that garlic and shit. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5804.379999999999s)]
*  And my body odor too. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5808.099999999999s)]
*  Cause you, you didn't wear deodorant. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5809.299999999999s)]
*  You know, forget about it. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5810.66s)]
*  I've been at the gym, you know, awful, awful, but in that, you know, that river. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5812.0199999999995s)]
*  So I went out in that river and I brought my sat phone with me, which I always have [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5817.259999999999s)]
*  whenever I'm out in the woods or wild or whatever, in case you get stranded somewhere. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5820.46s)]
*  So I'll go out in the river and I call my daughter and she picked up and she said, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5823.98s)]
*  the first thing she said to me was, did you hear about Papa? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5828.26s)]
*  And my dad had just been put in the hospital. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5832.06s)]
*  But what's weird is the medicine told me that that night. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5835.14s)]
*  So I ended up having to like call my pilots and get them to relocate. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5839.1s)]
*  So I didn't make it for the last two ceremonies, but I made it like seven [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5843.26s)]
*  days into the journey, but it was good that I made it to my dad because he needed [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5846.900000000001s)]
*  to eat some good stuff and needed to like get back. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5851.740000000001s)]
*  They had botched a catheter going in. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5854.38s)]
*  So he had like blood clots that kept him from going to the bathroom and like [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5856.06s)]
*  little mountain hospitals, bro, you know, where they put like, you know, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5860.38s)]

*  A lot of people just rub some cracklins on that. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5869.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5871.5s)]

*  like, yeah, people think gossip helps cancer or whatever. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5875.3s)]
*  Cause you'll see people out there with signs gossip for cancer. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5879.9400000000005s)]

*  That's a dang lie, dude, bro. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5886.26s)]
*  That, but the power of that kind of stuff of being under that medicine and the [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5888.3s)]
*  things you hear and learn in the moment you have, it shows you a connection in [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5892.66s)]

*  I would test their bowels. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5981.46s)]
*  Um, but just unbelievable. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5982.9800000000005s)]
*  Just, but just to think the things that like, that's what I learned from [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5984.620000000001s)]
*  my Alaska was, wow, there's some connection going on that is beyond. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5987.46s)]
*  I think it's because we're so void of it. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5992.18s)]
*  Same thing as the 72 degrees thing. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5993.74s)]
*  Like we're made to be interacting with the earth. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5995.7s)]
*  We're made to be digging up stuff out of the dirt and pulling things out of the [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=5997.86s)]
*  ground and getting scratched up and being out in the wild. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6001.0199999999995s)]
*  And because we're so void of that, we lose our connection to nature and those things. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6003.9s)]
*  Like I resonate a lot with like native American theology around, um, you know, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6008.74s)]
*  like the nature being what they called God or whatever, like I, that's where I [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6014.54s)]
*  find church for me is out in the wild because seeing the sunrises and sunsets [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6019.94s)]
*  and a, and a hard rain or a storm or in the ocean, like those things for me. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6025.179999999999s)]
*  Um, and we're so void of nature, everything around. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6029.54s)]
*  I mean, it's like, we have things that look like nature, but it's really not, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6034.86s)]
*  but we're not interacting with the earth and we're not having to adapt to the [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6038.78s)]
*  environment and figure out things. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6043.0599999999995s)]
*  And because of that void, then we're, we're left, we're left without that [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6044.78s)]
*  connection, right? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6049.78s)]
*  We don't have a connection, but I believe the native Americans had that connection [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6050.5s)]
*  because that's where they were living and that's where they got their food. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6053.78s)]
*  They, they're awesome friends that are native that do sweat lodges. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6059.62s)]
*  It's got Tom blue. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6063.5s)]
*  Wolf's incredible. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6064.26s)]
*  If you ever done a sweat lodge, dude, you should go to Georgia, do a sweat lodge. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6064.98s)]
*  Really? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6067.62s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6067.94s)]
*  You've done it before. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6069.74s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6070.38s)]
*  I've done it several, several times. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6070.82s)]
*  Uh, yes, he, he is amazing, but the way he sees the world and talks about it and [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6072.5s)]
*  whatever, he's like, if you're living a good life, then the food shows up, you [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6077.62s)]
*  know, deer will show up, things will happen where life provides for you. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6080.66s)]
*  If you're living a good life. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6084.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, wow. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6086.3s)]
*  That's him, but that's his sweat lodge right there. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6087.900000000001s)]
*  That's so that's in talking rock, Georgia. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6090.02s)]
*  That's not far from where I grew up. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6091.46s)]
*  Um, but it's not like there's no hallucinogenics or anything like that, but [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6093.58s)]
*  you're just going in this hut and sitting on the floor and they're bringing [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6098.14s)]
*  in these rocks that they heat up. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6101.54s)]
*  They only heat them, use them one time and, um, they bring them in, like. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6102.86s)]
*  They have a huge fire out front and a guy's, you know, tending the fire. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6107.0199999999995s)]
*  They have a fire keeper and these huge river rocks. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6110.86s)]
*  They, they heat them up and these things are like glowing orange. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6113.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6116.18s)]
*  And before you go in, you sit and you make your intentions and they, they [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6117.06s)]
*  give you little pouches, little things of tobacco and little pieces of fabric. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6120.38s)]
*  And you, you write, you put your intentions in there because the natives believe that [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6124.26s)]
*  tobacco is where your memories are. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6128.86s)]
*  Like the great spirit remembers whatever was put into tobacco. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6130.46s)]
*  So like if someone dies, they take tobacco and they floated out into the river and [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6134.1s)]
*  remembrance of that person or whatever. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6137.02s)]
*  But that was the plant for them that they smoked as, as a ceremonial thing for, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6138.46s)]
*  um, for memories. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6142.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, so you put your intentions in there, put your intentions in and you take your [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6145.9800000000005s)]
*  intentions into the thing with you and you sit there, you're like on a cold, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6151.46s)]
*  sandy, you know, ground and they bring them, they call the rocks grandfathers. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6154.46s)]
*  So they take a shovel and they lift this thing out and it's dark in there and they [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6159.139999999999s)]
*  bring it in and set it in and he takes Palo Santo and like sprinkles it on there [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6162.46s)]
*  and it looks like a constellation, like almost inside there and the smell of it. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6166.86s)]
*  And then he has sweet grass. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6171.7s)]
*  He brushes it with that and smells it. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6172.66s)]
*  And so you, you, you say welcome grandfather when they bring the stone in, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6174.299999999999s)]
*  it's like your ancestors basically coming in. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6178.259999999999s)]
*  And so they get a pile of grandfathers and then they, then he closes the thing [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6181.42s)]
*  and he's got a drum and he starts chanting and then he'll take water and pour it on [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6184.54s)]
*  there. It's just like being in a sauna. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6187.74s)]
*  So you're in there and it gets, it gets hot and then he opens it again and then [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6189.58s)]
*  he brings in more grandfathers. So by the end, by like round four or five, bro, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6194.26s)]
*  there's a lot of grandfathers in there. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6197.66s)]
*  And it's like, it's, it's so hot that some people have to like lay down close to [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6199.94s)]
*  the ground. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6203.34s)]
*  It's like a VFW. Yeah. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6203.82s)]
*  But if, if you, if you sit there and through the ceremony, as it gets hotter and [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6207.5s)]
*  hotter and hotter, you'll start seeing things. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6213.219999999999s)]
*  You'll start seeing visions and seeing shapes and seeing things like that. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6214.86s)]
*  And you purge, you're just sweating, man, sweating everything out, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6218.259999999999s)]
*  but he's leading you. You know, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6221.0599999999995s)]
*  that was this thing I would say about plant medicine. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6222.179999999999s)]
*  Like if you have somebody that's intentionally guiding you, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6223.86s)]
*  taking you on the journey and they know what they're doing, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6227.139999999999s)]
*  you're going to have an amazing experience. So it's not just, you know, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6229.46s)]
*  let's, let's go see fish and eat a sack full of mushrooms. Like there's nothing, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6233.34s)]
*  I mean, that's what, nothing wrong with that. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6237.139999999999s)]
*  If people want to do it, but it's a different intention, right? [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6238.9s)]
*  A hundred percent. I've had two experiences. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6241.22s)]
*  I've had one where a guy was a good shaman and led us. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6242.9400000000005s)]
*  I've had another one where a guy played like Ed Sheeran for three hours, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6246.54s)]
*  you know, and it was like still fun, little different, you know? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6251.5s)]
*  I've had one where they made like a real altar in the middle with all these [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6256.780000000001s)]
*  different deities and candles and everything. I've had, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6260.9400000000005s)]
*  I've been to one where they just lit one candle in the middle of this dark room. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6263.9400000000005s)]
*  And at first you're like, that's never going to light this room. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6268.5s)]
*  But by like the second day you're like, it's like all the light you need, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6271.18s)]
*  like you slowly adapt to how much light you have and you're just like, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6276.38s)]
*  oh, that's everything we have is right there, you know? But yeah, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6281.34s)]
*  so definitely the ambiance and if you have a shaman like leading you, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6286.3s)]
*  it can be unbelievable. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6289.780000000001s)]
*  And the sound, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6291.06s)]
*  the life coach is like managing the sound and playing music and playing different [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6291.740000000001s)]
*  like drums or things that help to do that. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6295.22s)]
*  So if there's intention behind it and you're doing it for healing, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6297.3s)]
*  but I would say out of the things that I have done, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6300.5s)]
*  the guided psilocybin journey for me was unbelievable, dude. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6303.06s)]
*  I can't, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6307.9400000000005s)]
*  I can't explain how much that helped me to let go of things, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6308.38s)]
*  but they have an intelligence they're going to go in and find it. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6312.700000000001s)]
*  I was kind of felt a little more like chaotic almost, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6314.9800000000005s)]
*  like I'm trying to figure out what it's trying to, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6317.42s)]
*  and it showed me some things that were very like, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6319.9400000000005s)]
*  it showed me that at one point I was like hugging myself and I was like, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6322.14s)]
*  and I didn't realize that I'm separate from my mind, right? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6326.34s)]
*  My mind and my spirit is a separate thing than my body, right? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6331.02s)]
*  Our body is our own company, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6333.9400000000005s)]
*  but I never thought about it that way because I'm like, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6335.660000000001s)]
*  I'm by myself, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6337.14s)]
*  but then I never really relied on just being alone is okay because you have [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6338.700000000001s)]
*  yourself, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6343.820000000001s)]
*  you have your body, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6344.34s)]
*  you can actually, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6345.14s)]
*  you know, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6346.5s)]
*  like I hugged myself and I was like, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6347.1s)]
*  it felt like I was holding another person and I was like, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6349.06s)]
*  wait a minute, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6350.900000000001s)]
*  I am my own person. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6351.620000000001s)]
*  Like I know that sounds weird, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6353.42s)]
*  but it's like, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6354.66s)]

*  So this is our masterpiece, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6962.62s)]
*  man. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6964.38s)]
*  This is, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6964.54s)]
*  this is our chance to really show what we can do as a band and to get to. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6964.94s)]
*  Look at that, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6970.94s)]
*  dude. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6971.74s)]
*  Zach, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6972.38s)]
*  that's crazy, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6972.62s)]
*  bro. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6973.66s)]
*  You guys are going to be in there. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6974.86s)]
*  What if God comes back and picks it up and takes it home, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6976.94s)]
*  then you win. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6979.5s)]
*  That's great. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6980.62s)]
*  I'll fly away, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6981.42s)]
*  bro. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6982.14s)]
*  Look, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6982.7s)]
*  dude, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6983.18s)]
*  we'll miss you and. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6984.14s)]
*  Congrats. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6986.38s)]
*  Those are the things I would say to you. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6987.099999999999s)]
*  That fish show was unbelievable in there. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6989.0199999999995s)]
*  It was cool. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6991.82s)]
*  And then what they did conceptually is cool because they played four hour shows, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6992.38s)]
*  four of them, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6995.82s)]
*  and they didn't play the same song twice or they didn't use the same content twice. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=6996.46s)]
*  So any of that kind of that was the same, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7001.1s)]
*  but it's different. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7003.58s)]
*  So they use it kind of as a big backdrop for what they were doing and for their shows and [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7004.22s)]
*  their fans loved it and did it. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7007.82s)]
*  I got some glimpses of what was fully possible with the building when you two was there because [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7010.14s)]
*  they play the same show pretty much every night because you pay to create all this content and [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7013.900000000001s)]
*  make it this like thing where they put you into something. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7017.34s)]
*  But I've got a team put together for this thing, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7019.82s)]
*  man, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7022.78s)]
*  and it's going to be it's going to be the best, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7023.0199999999995s)]
*  the biggest spectacle we've ever done. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7026.54s)]
*  And I'm very excited because this puts this puts us in another league and the goal is for our band [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7029.26s)]
*  to just keep going, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7036.7s)]
*  man, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7037.5s)]
*  to be like the Rolling Stones or like the Grateful Dead or like Jimmy Buffett. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7037.82s)]
*  Yeah, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7041.18s)]
*  Jimmy Buffett, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7041.66s)]
*  like being that legacy acts thing. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7042.3s)]
*  So this is really our first thing that I'm putting like a year plus of work in. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7044.0599999999995s)]
*  Making one show. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7049.66s)]
*  Wow, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7051.0199999999995s)]
*  it's going to be one show. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7051.74s)]
*  No, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7053.0199999999995s)]
*  it'll be like it'll be that show whenever people come. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7053.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7056.139999999999s)]
*  You know, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7056.299999999999s)]
*  yeah, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7056.7s)]
*  because if you go see it, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7056.94s)]
*  then does it did it change your perspective on what you can even do with the background [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7058.219999999999s)]
*  and everything? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7061.5s)]
*  That's why I'll see every show everyone that's playing there between now and us. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7061.74s)]
*  I will be there to see it and see what they're doing, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7064.78s)]
*  what's working, [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7066.78s)]
*  what's, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7067.42s)]
*  you know, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7068.219999999999s)]
*  could be better maybe from my perspective. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7068.46s)]
*  And, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7070.7s)]
*  you know, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7071.98s)]
*  it's but there's never been a venue created like that when you're watching the sunrise in [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7072.86s)]
*  there and they have a wind generator, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7076.46s)]
*  you feel the wind on your face and you're watching the sun come up. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7077.74s)]
*  I mean, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7080.06s)]
*  you feel like you're outside and you feel like you're in a, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7080.3s)]
*  you can't tell it's not real. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7083.74s)]
*  And that's the first thing that's been created on that scale. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7085.82s)]
*  That's like that. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7088.06s)]
*  Oh my God, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7089.9800000000005s)]

*  you know, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7113.5s)]

*  And to stay street regular as they call it. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7118.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7122.22s)]

*  if it rains, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7124.860000000001s)]
*  then it makes you have to go to the like do number two or whatever. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7125.820000000001s)]
*  I don't know why that is, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7129.02s)]
*  but I think it's you just, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7130.3s)]
*  your body just rubs against the ground. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7133.5s)]
*  It's really becomes like street legal or whatever, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7135.1s)]
*  but I don't know it. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7137.820000000001s)]
*  What if you marinate in your own solution long enough, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7140.06s)]
*  if that like somehow makes you more durable. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7142.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7145.34s)]

*  And that is something we got to explore as a community. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7148.700000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7153.34s)]

*  you know, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7396.46s)]

*  Like, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7452.78s)]
*  I think it's the key is like, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7453.26s)]
*  just staying curious, [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7454.9400000000005s)]
*  man. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7456.3s)]
*  And learning from anyone that you can, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7456.7s)]
*  like whatever, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7458.54s)]
*  never feeling like you know everything. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7459.820000000001s)]
*  Cause it's not about that. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7461.5s)]
*  It's about learning from each other, [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7462.62s)]
*  learning from each other's mistakes. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7463.9800000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7465.18s)]
*  Like I don't, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7465.74s)]
*  I don't want to do meth for 10 days straight and stay up like for a couple of months like you did that time. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7466.38s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7470.62s)]
*  I want to, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7471.9800000000005s)]
*  you know, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7472.62s)]

*  bro. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7473.900000000001s)]

*  I want you to get a good night's rest buddy. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7477.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7479.42s)]
*  I want you to get a good night's rest buddy. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7479.58s)]
*  You have your family. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7483.900000000001s)]
*  You have your music. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7485.26s)]
*  You have your creativity coming through. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7489.42s)]
*  You have knife making. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7493.1s)]
*  I know you guys have a wine company. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7495.9800000000005s)]
*  And what about, [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7498.22s)]
*  what else keeps you busy? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7500.14s)]
*  Like what is there a part, [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7501.58s)]
*  what else is something that you're really passionate about? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7503.900000000001s)]
*  Well, one of the things, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7506.3s)]
*  you know, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7507.5s)]
*  I wouldn't say I'm a religious person. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7507.98s)]
*  I started off that way and everything, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7509.9s)]
*  but I'm definitely a spiritual person. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7511.66s)]
*  And I think, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7513.259999999999s)]
*  I think I was given my music for a greater purpose other than myself. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7514.299999999999s)]
*  I think I was given my music as a gift to be able to pull people together to do things. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7517.9s)]
*  And so the greatest thing that [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7522.459999999999s)]
*  I've done or been a part of helping to come together is Camp Southern Ground, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7526.299999999999s)]
*  the place that we built. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7530.78s)]
*  And it's kind of like a university. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7532.459999999999s)]
*  Pull up a picture of it. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7535.339999999999s)]
*  Thank you for telling him to do that too. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7538.219999999999s)]
*  I always have to be the one to tell the guy. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7539.98s)]
*  So when you tell people it's a camp, [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7542.78s)]
*  it's not what you would expect. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7544.94s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7546.62s)]
*  So if you, if you go to 4.8 on Google reviews, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7547.419999999999s)]
*  if you go to images, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7550.78s)]
*  that's great. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7552.86s)]
*  I've never even seen it. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7553.5s)]
*  So everything, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7555.099999999999s)]
*  so first of all, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7557.66s)]
*  what I feel like I, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7558.459999999999s)]
*  as like the founder of this place, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7559.419999999999s)]
*  what I feel like I could do is to build a place and build the structures and everything [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7561.339999999999s)]
*  where it's going to be there for like hundreds of years. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7564.7s)]
*  So like the buildings are wrapped in a zinc envelope so that they don't naturally degrade. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7567.42s)]
*  They're going to be there. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7572.06s)]
*  That's the lodge, [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7573.34s)]
*  the third picture there. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7574.14s)]
*  And so I spent four years working with a firm to create and design everything. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7576.7s)]
*  And then now we're about 50% of the way through building the place. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7582.46s)]
*  And it's really just a really super sturdy, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7587.82s)]
*  amazing place to host things and do things. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7591.34s)]
*  So one of the things we do, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7593.66s)]
*  we have nine weeks of summer camp. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7594.62s)]
*  It is an integration camp. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7596.7s)]
*  So kids that are on the spectrum are in with mainstream kids. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7597.98s)]
*  Yeah, just like the one I went to. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7602.379999999999s)]
*  So I borrowed one from that. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7603.5s)]
*  And so nine weeks of that. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7605.179999999999s)]
*  And then we do 34 weeks of veteran programs through the year. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7606.459999999999s)]
*  We have, we just started our veteran family camps, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7610.219999999999s)]
*  which is six weeks of putting a veteran with their family as a unit [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7612.299999999999s)]
*  and helping them to see each other as a unit. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7615.66s)]
*  So when they get fractured, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7617.82s)]
*  sacrificing everything that they've learned how to do [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7620.299999999999s)]
*  and like been specialized in one thing, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7623.179999999999s)]
*  and then they're just like, oh, I don't need you anymore. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7625.18s)]
*  And then they got to go back to a normal, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7627.18s)]
*  sitting in a chair somewhere and whatever it's like, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7629.42s)]
*  figuring out how to help them transition back home from that [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7633.5s)]
*  and having programs that help them and help with PTSD to help with things. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7637.26s)]
*  We run the Warrior Path program, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7640.54s)]
*  which is Bernie Marcus's thing, one of the founders of Home Depot. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7642.780000000001s)]
*  So we were like the first or second campus that was chosen to do this. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7646.780000000001s)]
*  But you've built all these buildings and stuff here. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7650.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So it's more like a university-style campus. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7655.820000000001s)]
*  But what we do there is we help people to learn how to treat each other, [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7660.780000000001s)]
*  how to love each other, things that matter, help them to dream, [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7664.54s)]
*  help them to believe that they have potential to do things, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7667.02s)]
*  help them to see the diversity that's around. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7669.18s)]
*  So they take that out into the world. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7671.18s)]
*  We help our veterans come back and help them to find purpose. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7673.660000000001s)]
*  We have a Warrior Song program where a lot of them don't want to talk to civilians [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7677.259999999999s)]
*  about their story, but they'll write a song about it. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7681.5s)]
*  So we put amazing songwriters in with the veterans [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7683.66s)]
*  and they learn how to tell their story through a song. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7686.219999999999s)]
*  And then that's something they're willing to share. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7688.54s)]
*  It kind of helps them to open up and do things. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7690.139999999999s)]
*  So 34 weeks of veteran programs, nine weeks of children's programs, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7691.98s)]
*  we host things there like Mercedes Rinse Out, our treehouse. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7695.82s)]
*  That thing that looks like a spacecraft right there, that's the treehouse. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7699.66s)]
*  And it's got a, it's open in the middle. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7703.259999999999s)]
*  It's got a table, a circle table that comes down out of the ceiling. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7705.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7708.94s)]
*  And it comes down. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7709.339999999999s)]
*  And so we put executives, that's where we do all of our vision development. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7710.299999999999s)]
*  So like for the summer camp, we bring in all the nutritionists, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7716.299999999999s)]
*  the best nutritionists around that we can find in the nation or around the world. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7719.179999999999s)]
*  We bring like eight of the best nutritionists in. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7722.94s)]
*  We sit around this round table. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7724.94s)]
*  We talk and dream about what we need to feed the kids while they're there. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7726.299999999999s)]
*  So it makes them feel good, but it's accessible. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7729.0199999999995s)]
*  So they'll eat it and things like that. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7731.82s)]
*  And we got a 16 acre organic farm. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7733.58s)]
*  We grow the food there. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7735.66s)]
*  The kids learn how to pull stuff up out of the ground, plant things. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7736.62s)]
*  I love that kind of stuff. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7739.26s)]
*  Radishes, I remember. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7740.54s)]
*  We would do them. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7743.0199999999995s)]
*  That's awesome, Zach. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7745.099999999999s)]
*  Dude, congratulations, man. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7746.62s)]
*  But it's not really, there's nothing about this place. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7748.139999999999s)]
*  It's about me. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7750.38s)]
*  This is what I feel like I owe this. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7751.18s)]
*  And this is like a God thing for me, where I felt like I was given the music [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7753.0199999999995s)]
*  to help to create something bigger than myself. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7756.3s)]
*  But it's, I was kind of here following orders, man. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7758.3s)]
*  You like, you follow orders. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7762.38s)]
*  If you make your life about something bigger than you, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7764.379999999999s)]
*  it's not just about all the shit you can have [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7766.459999999999s)]
*  and being on a fucking mountain somewhere with all your shit. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7768.0599999999995s)]
*  Then that's really where a real meaningful life comes from [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7771.58s)]
*  is helping other people and doing it. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7775.58s)]
*  So we have an incredible campus at Camp Southern Ground to do that. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7776.94s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7779.66s)]
*  And then- [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7780.459999999999s)]
*  Do you go there each year? [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7781.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I spent a week, I lived there as a counselor this last summer. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7782.78s)]
*  So I was sleeping in the bunks and there just like I used to do. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7786.139999999999s)]
*  And being there and had kids that, it's a little rough for some of the kids [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7791.1s)]
*  that are on the spectrum the first day, like trying to get through to them [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7795.740000000001s)]
*  and help them feel comfortable and doing that. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7798.14s)]
*  And I have just the leadership we have there and the people we have coming in. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7800.46s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7803.740000000001s)]
*  But we can help other people use their program there too. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7805.18s)]
*  Like if you wanted to do a retreat there and bring people [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7807.58s)]
*  and have people come down, do team building, leadership, we feed you good, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7809.820000000001s)]
*  we put you up and take care of you. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7813.9800000000005s)]
*  And our staff helps you to have whatever experience you want to have there. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7816.54s)]
*  Wow. So it's kind of like, it's where people can rent out the, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7819.66s)]
*  like the play or organize their own function there. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7822.62s)]
*  Exactly. And we help to do that and pull it off without a hitch, taking care of people. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7825.66s)]
*  That is cool. Yeah. I love the idea of thinking about something that's [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7829.74s)]
*  greater than yourself. Sometimes I get stuck too much in the minutia of my own life. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7833.26s)]
*  And I know it's important because it is my own life to me. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7838.78s)]
*  But to get so stuck to it sometimes is, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7843.82s)]
*  you know, I think it's natural. I'm not looking down on myself, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7846.9400000000005s)]
*  but to try and have more of this mindset. I've had more of this mindset at times. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7850.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7855.740000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it's, I guess it feels a little tougher than others. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7856.860000000001s)]
*  I think you mentioned, we were talking earlier about having, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7859.5s)]
*  a way that you thought about contributing. You mentioned to me like, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7864.62s)]
*  kind of a halfway house or something. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7868.14s)]
*  Yeah. I want to get it, try to get a halfway house going and we're working on, [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7870.38s)]
*  we're starting like, there's a group, a men's group that we started. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7873.9800000000005s)]
*  That is every week has a meeting right now. It's just a zoom meeting, you know? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7879.900000000001s)]
*  But just the roots of it, you know? Yeah. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7884.22s)]
*  Trying to look at that and figure that out. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7886.780000000001s)]
*  Well, I think aligning that mission with whatever you're doing, you know, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7889.02s)]
*  whether it's your shows or whatever it is, like there's something like tangible to like talk [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7891.580000000001s)]
*  about. This is what we're doing. This is our mission. This is what, you know, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7895.34s)]
*  zeroing in on what that is and then aligning that with what you're doing. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7898.540000000001s)]
*  And then that naturally, like honestly stepping off into the dark on stuff like that, like the [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7901.5s)]
*  road rises right up to your feet underneath you when you start doing it. And I've seen the craziest, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7906.94s)]
*  like not, I would say miracle, but the craziest things happen that aren't a coincidence. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7912.3s)]
*  When you start aligning yourself with that, with what you feel like you can contribute to [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7918.3s)]
*  and make a difference in, then those things start, it starts manifesting, like those things start [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7922.22s)]
*  happening. And so just talking about it, like you were telling me about it and like taking action [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7927.18s)]
*  and aligning it with what you're already doing and then having that purpose, like everything starts [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7931.9800000000005s)]
*  to fall and literally stuff falls out of the sky on you. And you're just like, damn, like that's [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7936.46s)]
*  another affirmation that just keep going with it. Like, as we're talking about it right now, [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7941.74s)]
*  is one of those affirmations. It's like, but getting that place like, and we still got to [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7945.5s)]
*  raise the money for the second half of building it all, you know what I mean? So it's like, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7950.46s)]
*  finish the place out. We have all the basics of what we need, but then the biggest building [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7954.06s)]
*  in the whole place is what we're raising for right now. And so finding people that realize, [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7958.62s)]
*  and we're past the impossible point, because it used to be, I was like riding around a field, like [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7963.5s)]
*  this is where this building is going to be, you know what I mean? So now it's there and you can [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7967.42s)]
*  see the quality and they can see the impact of what we're doing. So trying to find the people [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7970.94s)]
*  that have something to give, that want to contribute in some way of doing it. Right. To say, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7974.94s)]
*  Hey, look, I love, I see what you've done halfway here. Let me help, you know, because I have the [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7979.0199999999995s)]
*  financial means, let me help you contribute towards the other half. And it's not about me. I don't [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7983.42s)]
*  care. It's nothing about that. It's about the difference that we can make there doing it. And [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7987.82s)]
*  if some people are looking for something to align themselves with, that can make a real impact, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7992.139999999999s)]
*  like we have one of those things and there's other things out there, but finding something [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7996.62s)]
*  that you're passionate about that you want to give back, there's that there's nothing that makes [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=7999.58s)]
*  you happier than like, I knew there'd be a day when I could stand out. It's pretty close to my house [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8003.98s)]
*  where I could stand outside and hear kids like singing and laughing through the woods. And then [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8008.86s)]
*  to get to hear that now and to feel it or whatever, it's just like, it lets me know that I'm on the [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8014.459999999999s)]
*  path of where I should be doing and that my life has purpose. Like it's not just raising my kids [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8019.099999999999s)]
*  and trying to move people with music, but it's like, I'm using that as a tool to make a difference. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8023.58s)]
*  Yeah. Amen, dude. Gosh, man. I want to come work at that summer camp. I feel like sometimes. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8028.219999999999s)]
*  You should. Do I have to have a [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8034.94s)]
*  um, [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8036.54s)]
*  jurisdiction or whatever, like, um, it's a, they're going to make sure you're not on some [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8038.78s)]
*  government lists and things like that. For sure. Yeah. I'm cool with that. I'm thinking, do I, yeah, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8044.38s)]
*  I got to think about what it's called before I ask about it. Um, dude, Zach Brown, I'm just, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8049.82s)]
*  I'm excited to get to spend time with you, man. I know that we've gotten to talk before and, [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMm-2sNs__4&t=8055.66s)]
