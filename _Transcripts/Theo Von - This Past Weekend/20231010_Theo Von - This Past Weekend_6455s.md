# Anthony Jeselnik  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #466
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k)
*  Today's guest is a writer. He's a stand-up comedian. He has countless specials on Netflix. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=0.0s)]
*  He has his own podcast called the Jeselnik Rosenthal Vanity Project that comes out every week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6.88s)]
*  His latest special is Fire in the Maternity Ward. He's a one of one. You hear that term a lot, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=15.44s)]
*  but there's I've never met nobody like this man. And I've always looked up to him and admired him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=23.36s)]
*  I'm really thankful to have him here today on the podcast. This is one of our first times [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=30.4s)]
*  sitting down and talking. So today's guest is Mr. Anthony Jeselnik. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=35.12s)]
*  I see this joke. You heard what happened to the Fonz? He got AIDS. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=60.0s)]
*  And how about that? And I'd be like, no, he didn't. No, he didn't guys. After I had this joke that I [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=75.68s)]
*  loved that was my family was exactly like the Brady Bunch. We might not have been perfect, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=81.68s)]
*  but my father did die from AIDS. And it would kill in the beginning of the first 10 years of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=86.88s)]
*  my career. It would kill so hard. People would be like, I love that joke so much. And then all the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=92.24s)]
*  sudden it just stopped working. And I was like, oh, my audience has gotten younger and they don't know [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=96.08s)]
*  about the Brady Bunch. They don't know the actor. So I was like, I got to stop doing it. Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=101.36s)]
*  Cause I think my fear would have been that something, oh, people don't love AIDS or they're not, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  or they're they've everybody's gotten on the side of like against AIDS, you know? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=110.72s)]
*  Theo, people love AIDS. It's like, it's what other disease gets its own quilt? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=115.52s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's a great point. Yeah. You don't see like a asthma [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Afghan. Yeah. Nothing else has that hype. Anthony Jeselnik, man. Nice to see you, dude. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=126.64s)]
*  Good to see you, man. It's been a while. Yeah, it has been a while. Yeah. I mean, I would see [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  you like at the store every now and again, like we were doing the store, but now everyone's on the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=136.32s)]
*  road doing stuff as your friends get successful and get busy. You just never see them again. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's probably happened because you've had a lot of success for a long time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=144.72s)]
*  Sure. So did that happen like kind of, I guess you just noticed that like, yeah, it was, was it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  more fun before? Was it, did it start to get more like lonesome? Like, what do you think? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  It gets lonely for sure because you come up with a certain group, you know, and you think everyone's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  going to make it. There's like 10 guys that you're with and you're like, we're all going to be stars [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  one day. And then like half of them quit, you know, the other half are just like become writers or [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=165.12s)]
*  something. And then you're like, oh, now I'm on the road. I don't see anybody anymore. And you get [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=169.6s)]
*  a different group of friends and they start doing movies and shit. So it's like, well, I love this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=174.64s)]
*  guy, but we never see each other because I'm on the road and he's doing movies. So you just lose [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=178.72s)]
*  all your friends always. Yeah. And it's hard to have when you're touring, it's hard to even keep [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  up friendships. It's like, sometimes I get so exalt, like I hate to say exhausted, but yeah, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=187.92s)]
*  I get exhausted with like whatever's going on or responsibilities. And then if even if a friend [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=193.12s)]
*  texts me, sometimes I'm like, I don't have, I'm just not dropped into a space where I want to engage [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=198.24s)]
*  in a conversation. Yeah. Or you're like, you're on the other side of the country. I'm not going to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=202.24s)]
*  write back right now. Well, like you ever like you get in a relationship and you're, you're dating [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=205.68s)]
*  someone for like a year and you don't see your friends as much. And then you break up and you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=210.24s)]
*  have to like remind your friends that you're still a person, you know, like, oh, I know we haven't [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=213.36s)]
*  been hanging out, but you got to start calling me again. Oh yeah. You're on the road for a year. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=217.44s)]
*  You'll hear from your friends for three years because you'll see someone and they're like, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=221.84s)]
*  what are you doing? You're like, I've been done. I've been around. Why haven't we, why have you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=225.04s)]
*  called me? You know, you just, you don't see people in there just out of mind. Yeah. I think [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=228.64s)]
*  the road makes me feel like a bad friend a lot. I think, cause I'll come back in this society, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  like reenter society or something like a pretty, like a convict or something, you know, you kind [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  of go through like a reentry where you see what you have in your closet. You're like, holy shit, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=242.32s)]
*  this stuff's been out of style for. Oh yeah. And all your stories are about like a driver you have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=246.72s)]
*  that you didn't like. And they're saying, we don't, this is not a real life. We don't know. We don't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=251.04s)]
*  know what you're talking about. You had a bad flight. Okay. I'd love to fly some. Yeah. I'd love [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  to go anywhere. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting, man. It's interesting as it gets, as your career goes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=258.16s)]
*  on, like what it's like, I think what I thought it would be like, maybe, I don't know. I think [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=265.36s)]
*  sometimes I think I stayed in comedy because it, I think I wanted something that you didn't have [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=270.08s)]
*  any commitments like in the world. Like I always got to leave whatever relationship, whatever moment [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=275.92s)]
*  a girl was like, what's going on? You know, like I have to be in, you know, Indiana. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=282.16s)]
*  So we'll find out when I get back and then eventually come back enough and, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  and there that wasn't even there anymore. Yeah. I think a lifestyle is a big draw to comedy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=294.24s)]
*  almost too big a draw. You know, you see the people who get into it for the lifestyle and then you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  watch them just destroy themselves immediately. The lifestyle is attractive. You know, people like [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=303.6s)]
*  the lifestyle more than the work. Nobody gets to be, nobody becomes a comic because they want to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=308.16s)]
*  sit and write jokes all day. They become a comic because they want the applause. You know, they [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=311.76s)]
*  want, they want to walk off stage and be like, where's the party? Yeah. That's true. Right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=314.96s)]
*  Cause yeah, people don't realize it's just a bar. It's like it really just a bar. It's a bar business [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=319.68s)]
*  with like a dancing guy. Yeah. If you're like, I need to get a job, but I like to drink too much, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=324.32s)]
*  become a comedian. Like in your, your set. Yeah. Two birds, man. Did it, did you ever almost get [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=330.24s)]
*  married? Was there ever a point where you almost got where like that almost happened for you? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=337.36s)]
*  Not like I, about the same as like me thinking about going to law school, you know, when you're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=343.04s)]
*  like at a certain age and your friends are like doing real things and you're like, oh, like maybe [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=347.76s)]
*  I guess this is where I just go and go to law school and become a lawyer. Yeah. You know, it's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=351.36s)]
*  like, oh, my friends are all getting married. I've been in a relationship a long time. Maybe I will. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=355.12s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh wait, no, people just do it just because they think it's what they're supposed [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=360.32s)]
*  to do. You think so? I think a lot of people do. Yeah. You just like, oh, I get married. That's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=364.16s)]
*  what I do. And then you're like 10 years in, you're like, wait, why am I doing this? And now at this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  point in my life, getting married just seems like a terrible financial decision. Yeah. It's just like [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  why I don't, I don't know if this makes sense. So do you think a lot of people, they just feel like [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  that's what they have to do. It's like, I have to get married now. There's, it's just what I'm [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=383.68s)]
*  supposed to do. It's like my responsibility. Do you think it's to like family? Do you think it's just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  like to society? I'm just wondering, cause I've never had like that mindset, whatever that mindset [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=391.12s)]
*  is. It's just never been kind of whatever's in my head. I think it's both, I think it's family and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=395.44s)]
*  society. You know, I've got several married siblings and they're always like, when are you [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=400.32s)]
*  getting married? Like people, when they get married, they want everyone else to join their crew. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=404.08s)]
*  You have a kid, you want everyone else to have a kid too. So you can talk about having kids. It's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=407.76s)]
*  like, I'm not going to have a kid just because you did. And maybe if I lived in like a suburb [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=411.12s)]
*  somewhere and that was my life and it was like, this is my house. I'm staying in this house. Then [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=415.76s)]
*  it's like, all right, kids are, that's what I'm going to spend my life doing. Right. There's a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=420.48s)]
*  place for a kid to be over here. We could definitely put a kid in this area. Yeah. And I definitely [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  don't want kids. I even went through a phase where I was like, if it happened, I've got money now. I [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=430.72s)]
*  could, I could handle this, but I had no real interest in doing it. Do you think you'd even [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=434.8s)]
*  have bad luck having kids? Cause so many kids die in your material. It is a thing that I think [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  about. Like I've done, talked a lot about sharks. And so I would never go surfing. Cause if I get [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=447.6s)]
*  eaten by a shark, everyone's going to be like, see, this is Carmen. He does, he like, he was, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  this was his fate his whole life. That having a kid seems terrifying. I think every parent goes [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=455.6s)]
*  through this. Once you find out you're pregnant of like, you know, so many things can go wrong. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=460.32000000000005s)]
*  You hear about the bad, you hear about the good, you know, you're counting the toes and the fingers, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  autism, like all kinds of different stuff that you're just like hoping that just, it seems like [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=468.72s)]
*  nice not to deal with that stress. I don't miss it. And sometimes you don't know if your kid's [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=473.52s)]
*  autistic for like a couple of years and stuff, I think. So it's like, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=478.4s)]
*  dude, we both know people who are like for sure autistic and they just [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=483.28s)]
*  undocumented. Yeah. Yeah. Undocumented autistic. Get them out of the country. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=487.12s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of, I've had a lot of theories that a lot of the future will be people like, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=491.28s)]

*  they, when I stopped to drop them off, they asked, they just asked point blank if I wanted to have [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=659.12s)]
*  that Wheeling feeling. And I was like, I don't know. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know if it was [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=664.48s)]
*  crime or if it was, you know, like a rash or, you know, I didn't know what the hell it was or tickling [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=669.6s)]

*  I just didn't do it, you know? How many opportunities, sexual opportunities do you [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=680.88s)]
*  think you've turned down because you just didn't understand the euphemism? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=684.96s)]
*  Oh, one time in Baltimore, I got offered a threesome. Pretty sure it was threesome or it was like a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=689.28s)]
*  pyramid scheme, which is, I don't know if those are similar or not, but it was extremely similar. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=696.0s)]
*  Yeah. Practically the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, it was outside and it was kind of dark. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=701.36s)]

*  um, and yeah, I guess I got offered that. Oh, one time I got into a sexual endeavor with two women [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=711.76s)]
*  and this was in Columbia, Missouri. And they, um, the, one of them was like, it looked like one of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  those bodybuilders from like, like, remember when they were where the one, the singlet and they would [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=729.04s)]
*  have the thing and they would hold it up and it would say like a hundred pounds written on it or, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=734.08s)]
*  yeah, you know, 140, like at the circus or whatever. One of them was like, kind of, I felt [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  attracted to and the other one had this kind of like Polish kind of like, uh, like, um, bodybuilder [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  vibe. And I got coerced into that. And that was, that was intense, man. See, I don't trust three [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=750.88s)]
*  ways. I've never had one. I've been propositioned and been like, I don't believe you. Yeah. Like [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=758.72s)]
*  there's a catch. Yeah. This, this is too, there's something's going to happen here. Yeah. Like a [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=762.96s)]
*  random hookup on the road. You're like, I'm going to hear from you again. There's no free lunch. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=767.52s)]
*  Right. There's no free lunch. You're getting a follow-up email for sure. Um, and the next time [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  you're in town, they're going to be in the front row being like, right. And so, oh yeah, the three [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=776.48s)]
*  way is just like two of those coming at you. Yeah. Did it when you first started out, what made you [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=781.04s)]
*  stay in comedy? You think were there times where you ever going to give up or you've had success [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=786.64s)]
*  really since you kind of kicked it off? It seems like it took a couple of years. I found that in [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=791.04s)]
*  the beginning, I'm sure you understand this, that in the first couple of years, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=796.32s)]
*  it's embarrassing to tell someone you're a comedian. Oh, it's the worst. It's almost like, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=800.32s)]
*  yeah, you could be like, a lot of people in my, where I'm from, they felt like you were gay. You [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=803.44s)]
*  didn't want to bring a wife home. You didn't want to admit something. What are you doing? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=807.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, not that there's anything wrong with being gay, but there were just, you know, that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=811.84s)]
*  those were some of the things like, oh, just tell us what's going on. Yeah. You know, if you have [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  cancer or whatever, just tell us. People don't understand. Your parents don't understand. Your [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=818.4000000000001s)]
*  family's like, what you're doing. What? Like, why don't you try to be more like this? Why don't you [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  do last comic standing? I would hear all the time. And it's like, that's a bad show. I don't [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=824.8s)]
*  want to do that. And then I thought the only thing more embarrassing than saying I'm a comedian for [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  the first few years would be saying I used to do comedy. Like saying that, oh yeah. Like you ever [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=833.04s)]
*  after a show, someone's like, you know, I tried, I thought about doing that. You're just like, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=838.4s)]
*  get the fuck out of here. Yeah. That like, I thought that was so embarrassing that I'm like, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=841.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to will myself to some level of success. And I thought at the time, I thought [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  that meant I would get a writing job and I would quit stand up and I would just be a joke writer [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=848.88s)]
*  for the rest of my life. And by the time I finally got that joke writing job, I was like, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=852.72s)]
*  I was doing well enough at stand up that I was like, I just want to do this. I don't want to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=856.72s)]
*  write for someone else. I'm the only one who's going to tell my jokes. Why don't I just keep [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=859.6800000000001s)]
*  doing this? And it worked out. Did you not want anybody else telling your jokes to, oh, you just [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=863.6s)]
*  said it. Nobody would. Like if I wrote, I wrote for Sarah Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel, and they were [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  like, if I love the joke, they loved it too. And they would tell it. And I was so proud to have [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  them tell my joke. No problem with that. But then I would write for Jimmy Fallon and he would say, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=875.84s)]
*  this is really funny, but people are going to hate me. And I'm like, you're right. But I don't [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=880.0s)]
*  care. That's fine. You can hate me and still laugh. You can't hate Jimmy and still laugh. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=884.48s)]
*  So it just didn't work out. But I was like, oh, I need to just write my own stuff and do it myself. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=889.04s)]
*  Like I've got my own way of telling the jokes. Yeah. That is, oh yeah. It's a, it's a horrible [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=893.44s)]
*  dance. You take us on. I mean, it's, it's marvelous. Yes. I knew, I knew what you meant. Okay, good. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=899.92s)]
*  Yeah. It's exceptionally. It's like, yeah, I feel like you, I, here's, I always feel like it's that [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=904.8s)]
*  same feeling I get watching you and watching some of your material when I'm in a haunted house. And [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=910.8s)]
*  I know I'm going to be scared, right? I'm walking through something. I know there's something right [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=917.04s)]
*  around the corner that's, that's, you know, and I just keep going down the road. And then next thing, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=923.28s)]
*  you know, um, again, you got me again. Thank you. Yeah. I, I consider myself when I describe it as [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=930.96s)]
*  a horror film, like, you know, you're in good hands. You know, you're not watching a snuff film. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=938.4000000000001s)]
*  This is like a real movie with real actors. And at the end you'll be satisfied and there's going to [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=942.48s)]
*  be some scares. Like just enjoy it. It's all fun. I don't have a message, just, you know, nihilism. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you ever, did you ever feel like you were haunted? Like a lot of people, you know, think [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  that people are haunted and stuff like that. Did you ever have any, like at a certain point, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=956.08s)]
*  you have to look at yourself and be like, Oh, well I am, there's something unique, you know, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=960.56s)]
*  there's something very Simon Birch about me or something, you know? Uh, yeah, no, I, um, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=965.76s)]
*  people ask me that all the time, like, because I have a dark sensibility, like something happened [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=970.4799999999999s)]
*  to you. And it's like, no, I've had a very charmed life. Like I've had a great life. My parents are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=974.8s)]
*  still together. You know, there was no abuse. I was always drawn to violence and, and awful things [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=979.1199999999999s)]
*  in life. It just, people just didn't talk about them. And I was like, why not? They're so important. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=986.4s)]
*  Why is this so forbidden? Why does no one want to talk about death? You know, when I was a kid, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=990.48s)]
*  I was shamed for that a lot of like always being like, well, what about this? And they're like, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=995.04s)]
*  stop talking about that. Like we don't want to talk about the challenger anymore, Anthony. Like [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=998.3199999999999s)]
*  it blew up. Like you're in first grade, just can move on to other things. And I, I didn't understand [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1001.76s)]
*  what was unhealthy about it. I thought if the greatest minds in history have been sitting there [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1005.76s)]
*  wondering what happens when we die, why is it weird for a kid to think about it? So that them [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1010.3199999999999s)]
*  pushing back on me made me mad. And that anger carried me through my first 10 years of comedy. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  And then you get success and you let go of the anger and like, okay, what do I have left? And [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  it's interest, you know, it's these topics interest me and I want to find a way to make [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  people laugh at them. Wow. That's interesting, man. Do you think like that we do it, but like, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1029.2s)]
*  do you think a lot of people do it? There's a chip on their shoulder. Yes. Like they want to prove [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1034.32s)]
*  that they, yeah, what did I, what I'm trying to think of? What did I want to prove? Prove you're [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1038.48s)]
*  not a loser. I feel like when you were in school, it's like you're ruining, you're not only are you [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1045.2s)]
*  messing up your own education, but everyone around you, everyone sitting within four desks [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1049.12s)]
*  is getting a worst grade because they're near you. Everyone's furious and you're like, I've got to [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1054.0s)]
*  prove like my high school put me in the hall of fame, the alumni hall of fame a few years ago. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1058.4799999999998s)]

*  they like gave you a accommodation of sort? Yeah, they gave, they had, it was like this, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1087.68s)]
*  this like little trophy thing, like a big glass, like triangle. There were like, you know, 10 other [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1091.68s)]
*  people that all kind of gave little speeches, but I was like, I'm the one who had a TV show with my [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1095.6000000000001s)]

*  plays tennis, but that's why he's in it. Right. He's a, yeah. Sure. When Williams manager, it counts, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1104.4s)]
*  but, um, wow, dude, that's unbelievable. Did it almost, I wonder if that would make me feel [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1108.8000000000002s)]
*  like so much more rewarded than anything, because that was like the battlegrounds of being fun. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1115.52s)]
*  Like that was where I feel like it was the most fun to be funny. Yes. Did you have that experience [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1121.1200000000001s)]
*  or no? Yeah. I mean, I, I couldn't not tell a joke. If I thought of it, I'm like, this is too good. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1127.44s)]
*  It's gotta go to, it's going to go to waste. But my thing was trying to make the teacher laugh. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1132.64s)]
*  Oh, because you made a joke in class, teacher would yell at you immediately. But if you made [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1136.8000000000002s)]
*  her laugh or him laugh, it was always a woman. And I think about it, uh, then they couldn't get mad [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1141.2s)]
*  at you. And that felt so good because it was like, you knew you did something wrong, but you did it [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1146.4s)]
*  in the best way possible. So now you're the star. Oh, that's fascinating. How do you not get in [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1151.2s)]
*  trouble? Like how, like, right. I understand you're going to put me in trouble, but you and I know, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1157.0400000000002s)]
*  yes. And all these comics now, it's like almost the point is to get in trouble. It's like, why are [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1161.92s)]
*  you giving me shit? I'm, I'm a comic. I'm allowed to say whatever I want. That's wrong. As far as [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1166.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm concerned, art always say it again. So I don't miss it. People think like, oh, as a comic, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1170.5600000000002s)]
*  your job is to get in trouble. And so, but they don't want to get yelled at. It's like, it's okay [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1174.88s)]
*  to make people mad, but they don't want any pushback. And I think that's wrong. As a comedian, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1178.96s)]
*  you want to make people laugh. Andy, this is a quote attributed to Andy Warhol that I love. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1183.8400000000001s)]
*  It's just art is getting away with it. You know, if you put out a special and everyone's pissed, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1188.4s)]
*  like you didn't get away with it. You know, you need to make everyone laugh at the, like, yeah, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1194.4s)]
*  he talked to them, fucked up stuff, but we're all happy. That's art. Otherwise you're just a troll. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1198.24s)]
*  That's fascinating, man. Cause it adds another level to a lot of things. You're like, the, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1205.68s)]
*  the superfluous level isn't enough. You like, I want to go to this, this other level, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1211.36s)]
*  even thinking of, I'm going to get the teacher to laugh. I never have thought about that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1217.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. It just happened one day teacher laughed and I was like, oh, I'm not in trouble right now. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1221.9199999999998s)]
*  I would have been what's the difference. Oh, teacher left. And it was like, it was a stern [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1225.76s)]
*  teacher. It was a strict teacher who like never laughed. And it was like, oh, okay, if I can get [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1230.3999999999999s)]
*  her, I can do this. Yeah. Dude. I used to think that if I stared at my teacher enough, that they [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1234.0s)]
*  would want to have sex, you know, really? I never, I had, there was a, we had a French teacher [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1239.44s)]
*  that was crushed in like sixth grade who, uh, first of all, even being French makes you think [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1244.48s)]
*  they're going to want to be sexually. Yeah. And it was a gym teacher. Oh, what a French gym. No, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1249.76s)]
*  she was, it was a, it was the French teacher. She was American, but spoke French. And then there was [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1255.28s)]
*  a gym teacher who was also a babe. I think you guys were doing like, you know, we did learn the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  basics of Cirque du Soleil. Okay. So the early stuff. Yeah. Um, and she was hot. As I, as I [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1266.32s)]
*  remember, like I could, if she walked in here right now, I wouldn't know who the hell she was, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1274.48s)]
*  but at the time, cause a lot of our teachers were busted, you know, dogsville. Okay. Not attracted. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1277.04s)]
*  Yes. So even some real hounds. One of them was even like remotely young was like, oh my God, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1283.4399999999998s)]
*  this, this, she's a mermaid. Yeah. We had one that either had huge breasts or filled her [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1287.76s)]
*  shirt with something that looked like breasts. And she wore like a doily, like around her neck [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1293.28s)]
*  kind of, or whatever that little collar thing was. And we were all like, literally do when she came [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1299.04s)]
*  in the room, you could feel like, cause it was like right around that, uh, when people were going [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1305.28s)]
*  through pervade or whatever, and you could feel people didn't even know how to exist. Like all the [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1310.48s)]
*  blood would rush to like your brain, like parts of your, like you didn't even know how to stand. It [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1316.32s)]
*  was just God, when there was a war, because teachers are also the first woman that you're [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1320.96s)]
*  around a lot of times where you're in the same space. It's not your mother, but you're around [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1326.48s)]
*  each other a lot. They're in a position of power. So if they look a little attractive, I think it's [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1332.56s)]
*  like, it can be very sexual for a lot of young men. It's, it's a, the crazy fantasy, you know, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1338.08s)]
*  like a teacher, you know, but I think when you're, when you hit puberty as a, as a boy, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1344.32s)]
*  they start to send you to health class. You know, it's like they separate the boys and the girls, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1349.52s)]
*  they start talking to you. I can't believe they don't just like put you in jail for three years, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1352.3200000000002s)]
*  because everyone, everyone from the age of like 11 to like 16 is up to no good. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1356.64s)]
*  It's pure evil. And this is, but we were before the internet, man. Like you had to know someone [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1363.8400000000001s)]
*  who had an older brother who had a playboy collection and they would like tear out like a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1370.4s)]
*  picture and bring it to you. And I remember that someone gave me one. It was just a woman from [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1374.88s)]
*  she was just standing up, had like a perfect ass, but it was just her ass and like her hair. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1378.96s)]
*  And this is the only picture that I had. This was it. And it was like, I might ask guy now, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1383.28s)]
*  like, I don't know. This is just what you have. And now these kids are just like every little [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  thing, every, every fetish, every fantasy you could ever imagine there is at their fingertips. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1391.2s)]
*  And it's not good. I can't imagine in 10 years, shit's going to go down. Like it's going to be, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1396.32s)]
*  everyone's going to have a sex dungeon. It's going to be crazy wild shit. And we know it's [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  going to be able to keep up. Oh, I think, uh, oh yeah. I remember somebody even give you a [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1405.84s)]
*  picture as a regular chick and they'd write like hot pussy on it or something. And you think, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1411.52s)]
*  you know, like, oh, this is, and she wasn't even naked. It's just like, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1415.04s)]
*  somebody had written that. I remember when someone told me about the P word and I just [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1417.84s)]
*  couldn't even, I felt so ashamed that I didn't know it. I felt like I didn't know how to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1422.72s)]
*  communicate anymore. Like the world was passing me by. Cause like some guys like, you don't know [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  what the, you know, he would say, you know, I don't like saying it that much, but he would [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1433.68s)]
*  say like, you don't know what he means, you know? And I'd be like, do you not like saying the word [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1436.96s)]
*  because of like the combination of letters or you don't like calling someone that, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1442.72s)]
*  like, would you have a problem calling a guy a pussy or you just don't want to describe [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  the anatomy as I think if a guy only had like one wing or something and we're, and he's hungry [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1451.44s)]
*  and he only then I would might say something like that, but I don't think I like saying it [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1458.5600000000002s)]
*  because I don't want people to hear it if they're listening somewhere and they don't feel comfortable [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1461.84s)]

*  the word pussy. I think it's people that probably I don't, I don't want them to hear it that much. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1470.72s)]
*  I don't care if they hear it once in a while, but I think that it, yeah, I try not to put that out [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1476.08s)]
*  there too much. My audience, I feel like I'd want them to hear it from me. You know, it's like, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1482.24s)]
*  I'm a trusted source. I don't want them hearing it out on the street from random randos, you know, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1486.56s)]

*  real control thing, I think, like control of my environment. And when I didn't know, and then I was [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1515.36s)]

*  like an employee for like very low level allowance that you never even got. There was always some [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1824.72s)]
*  reason you didn't get it and that's what it felt like. It felt like a little bit of a pyramid scheme [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1831.36s)]
*  is what it kind of our family felt like. Theo, do you know what a pyramid scheme is? Yeah it's like [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1838.0s)]

*  I think some of the top is like you pay me and then you get, but for paying me you get to come in [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1863.52s)]
*  and then people below you are going to pay you and the money's going to flow up. Oh yeah. So you get [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1870.48s)]
*  involved and then you help more people get involved. Yeah it wasn't like that. It was not that. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1875.2s)]
*  Yeah it was more like kind of trickled down maybe some type of Reaganomics or something. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1879.9199999999998s)]
*  It was something that wasn't working. Families weren't fair. Like I feel like my family, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1884.3999999999999s)]

*  no if you wanted something. Okay. And now they say that families, you should tell your kids like [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1893.9199999999998s)]
*  here's how much dad makes, here's how much mom makes, here's what the budget is, here's what the [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1898.0s)]

*  smart was my family was like no you can't have that but I didn't know why and then I grew up and [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1905.36s)]

*  we had everything and my parents just didn't want to give it to us. God that's an insane thought. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1919.76s)]
*  Yeah. It's so macabre. Yeah I was like oh they're just being mean I can't get a Nintendo and I was [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1926.32s)]

*  to do that. Yeah. Do you think like you were a good brother when you were growing up or not? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=1957.76s)]

*  quest for meaning that's what a lot of his stuff is about and he talks about like the stoics and [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=2948.56s)]
*  like Aristotle and like the past and how man has always searched for meaning kind of but a lot of [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=2953.2s)]
*  he talks about his shared experiences that's one of the biggest things that we had as humans like [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=2958.56s)]
*  is that we share experiences yeah you would all I mean we would all watch a show then we would go [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=2963.36s)]

*  comedian to suddenly you know like there's something can something happen in your brain [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3496.72s)]

*  pretty boring you know at least if I'm alive I can do any you know the things are possible I feel like [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3593.6s)]

*  a sign of respect when I was growing up like if somebody did something you know we had people [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3722.56s)]
*  that couldn't really speak really well and very you know just damn limited you know and [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3729.28s)]
*  so people would take their shirt off as like a sign of like um [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3736.88s)]
*  like respect you know like we're with this guy you know I remember that [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3742.2400000000002s)]
*  like on like you're watching 9-11 you just like everybody take your shirts off no no be something [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3746.96s)]
*  more localized like if you were watching like uh like if somebody had started like a ditch fire [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3752.88s)]
*  or something and you know people were supporting him or whatever he was doing if he was burning [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3759.12s)]
*  like there if it was a woman burning her husband's stuff or whatever or something if you were doing [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3764.1600000000003s)]
*  if you were in support of whoever was doing something there was like uh it was almost like [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3768.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what to say so I'm just gonna say that I'm a I am showing myself here so it's very [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3773.84s)]
*  it felt very primitive when I think back on it so you take the shirt off and you're done or you [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3780.24s)]
*  swinging it around no you throwing the shirt away like this shirt's done now I just saw something [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3784.24s)]
*  so cool but you just hold it until yeah you just hold it you say like I'm here and then this moment [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3789.7599999999998s)]
*  of respect is over 10 minutes 15 minutes put your shirt back on yeah things will kind of dissipate [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3794.64s)]
*  or something I think somebody you know the oldest kid will put their shirt back on and then the rest [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3799.2s)]
*  of kids will put their shirt back on so it's like a it was an age thing I think it was like a um [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3802.8799999999997s)]
*  yeah it was something but I just remember that if you didn't know what to do you just took your [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3810.48s)]
*  shirt off if you're around an adult sometimes you took it you know just to show it was like a sign [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3815.52s)]
*  of respect somehow I just remember people doing it a lot I always think it's funny when you see [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3819.92s)]
*  like you see fights online like I follow Twitter accounts just like here's a fight and it's like [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3826.0s)]
*  the worst just some door some like random guy in the suburbs rips his shirt like they start arguing [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3829.7599999999998s)]
*  he tears his shirt off and starts flexing always makes me laugh why do they allow these children [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3833.6s)]
*  you ever see the fights of children beating up other children on one why do they allow that to [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3838.96s)]
*  be on it seems like we created a culture that is just imitating what they see right because at a [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3843.44s)]
*  certain point you just see the same it's like the same exact video just new people and I'm like why [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3851.12s)]
*  shouldn't there be a block that's what I get weird about like free speech kind of I guess you know [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3857.52s)]
*  it's like shouldn't there be a block that lets us not see this the fight the kids fighting yeah I [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3862.96s)]
*  just think it's like because then some kid sees that now 20 other kids are going to go make the [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3869.36s)]
*  video yeah like are we just perpetuating it you know I don't know I mean there were plenty of [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3874.08s)]
*  fights before this started happening I don't think anyone's fighting for the video you almost hope [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3880.08s)]
*  it's the kind of fight that doesn't like that isn't going to be online like I would gotten the [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3884.4s)]
*  last time I got in a real fist fight I think it was like a sophomore in high school and they filmed [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3888.96s)]
*  a camcorder on a tripod what and filmed it and I won the fight was it Comedy Central what the [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3893.28s)]
*  like who was it a company that filmed the fight yeah when I was 16 years old oh I thought you [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3900.2400000000002s)]
*  you said high school high school yeah oh sorry so I went high school okay and just the guy thought [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3906.2400000000002s)]
*  he was going to beat me up and had his friends film it and I won the fight and then did yeah and [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3911.1200000000003s)]

*  this guy's bigger than me and I'm not winning this fight in the beginning and we get to a point we've [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3921.04s)]
*  both thrown a couple punches and he gets me from behind he's like got me in like a bear hug [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3925.36s)]

*  when you fight was to someone would get him from behind and he would put his head forward and slam [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3948.72s)]
*  his head back and so I just let my all my body weight go like I just went limp and I had my head [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3953.12s)]
*  dropped down and slammed it back and caught him right in the head and he went down and you hear [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=3958.0s)]

*  but then I went I remember Curtis from Comedy Store yeah he's like running now he was like hey [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4015.44s)]
*  yeah he's awesome Curtis Nelson yeah he was like just come over after your show and like we'll be [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4019.44s)]
*  closed but I'll give you a tour that's exactly what he did showed me all like the memorabilia [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4024.0s)]
*  on the walls and like showed me the stages and like it all seems you know pretty uh pretty perfect [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4027.52s)]
*  it's cool yeah I think one thing that they're doing well one thing I noticed when I was there [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4033.44s)]
*  I just I think I've done maybe two sets there right but it's nice I mean when you go there like [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4037.36s)]
*  you know if you do do a set there they you know they just surprise the audience with you so it [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4043.52s)]
*  like you could just they're just amped you know so that always feels pretty nice I think and it'd be [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4048.0s)]
*  a place where a comedian opened a comedy club I think is kind of interesting and that they get [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4053.52s)]
*  paid better right that's one thing I think is really cool I like it that I mean is that the [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4057.92s)]
*  comedians get paid better I root for that place I root for and there's no comedy club I root against [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4062.56s)]
*  but it just seems like it's probably a little bit easier there oh because it's kind of like a built-in [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4068.0s)]
*  like this like a lot of the audience that likes like like a rogan audience or a handscliff on it [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4076.0s)]
*  like a home team it's a built-in approval like you you're not Joe Rogan cannot bomb at that club [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4081.68s)]
*  right you know I mean that it's like they right everybody coming is hoping they see him yes and [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4087.04s)]
*  I've got jokes where it's like I want the audience to be like oh fuck you know I don't want them to [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4091.3599999999997s)]

*  that place and this is not it's just because it's new and people are excited about the club but it [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4104.8s)]
*  doesn't seem it seems like a little bit uh people will say come play in our sandbox I want to play [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4109.44s)]
*  on the beach uh see what you're saying you know yeah no well I think it's a good point that I [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4115.919999999999s)]
*  think as you get when people know you yeah a lot of times even when I go on stage I'm like are they [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4120.799999999999s)]

*  something in common or they just get you know I don't doubt myself but you did the the the [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4139.36s)]
*  setup changes it's not where you went on stage for 14 years and they didn't know who you were [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4146.0s)]
*  so you knew you got to win them over yeah you knew there were so many pieces of feedback that [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4152.16s)]
*  you were getting that let you know you were genuinely you were doing well whereas now it's [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4158.8s)]

*  how do you find an audience then I mean I guess you just pop on on shows where people don't know [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4173.12s)]
*  you're gonna be there maybe that's probably the best way I mean tv was my thing tv and like I [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=4177.12s)]

*  and the show got cancelled like I had a couple years off tv and it was like it went away almost [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5240.4s)]
*  immediately where it was just like the temperature got dialed down but I didn't like people looking [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5244.24s)]
*  at you and being like I know you from something I don't know what it is but like I know you that [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5249.6s)]

*  on something I hated I really hated being famous you know yeah I think it's uh it feels exhausting [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5259.92s)]
*  it feels like a whole nother life you have to live yes it's like you're not just doing the one [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5267.360000000001s)]
*  show you're doing shows all the time and you don't know when it's happening like you're walking [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5272.64s)]
*  through the airport and you like get home when you see someone's been following you around taking [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5277.6s)]
*  pictures and posting them all and they're like this is just weird and it gets in your head [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5280.64s)]

*  just not having to deal with that type of energy or like because it's already weird enough if [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5297.6s)]
*  somebody knows you but then I think if they're wasted it makes you just kind of scared it's just [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5302.64s)]
*  too risky oh yeah and then they come they want to come back it's like hey I just want to say I'm a [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5307.68s)]

*  you know they pay buy tickets but when they're drunk it is really tough to deal with yeah one [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5324.8s)]
*  guy put me on the phone with his sister and she's fighting with her husband like having a [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5330.24s)]

*  quick and get out of here but I'm like this is all going on eBay this is dumb as shit but I'm [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5364.4800000000005s)]
*  it's easier just to do it but if like we do a video for my friend who couldn't make it no [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5368.320000000001s)]
*  I'm not I'm not doing that were you bummed when the roast kind of went away did that bum you out [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5372.8s)]
*  no I was I was I was happy to do three and then done perched for you yeah and it was I mean it [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5378.320000000001s)]
*  was all I wanted to do I was like building my act towards getting on that the Trump roast was like [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5384.72s)]
*  my big break my life was night and day after that then the sheen roast came like a couple months [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5389.6s)]
*  later it wasn't that long and that was even bigger and that I felt insane pressure because I was like [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5394.08s)]
*  well that was my big break and I those were jokes that I've been working on forever now I've got [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5399.280000000001s)]
*  four months it's my sophomore album that could tank and I didn't want it to seem like oh I got [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5403.280000000001s)]
*  lucky so that roast was so stressful and then it was like a year until the Roseanne was my last one [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5407.68s)]
*  and that was a letdown it wasn't done the same uh like hype to it that Trump and sheen had like [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5413.68s)]
*  the next I'm right I just showed the next weekend and like the ticket ticket sales were just normal [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5418.64s)]
*  like it wasn't like I didn't get the bump that I got after sheen and Trump and I was like you know [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5422.8s)]
*  I don't really want to do this anymore it's like it's just not fun telling the same kinds of jokes [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5426.64s)]
*  and I didn't approach it like Jeff Ross who was just like Jeff Ross could do it forever right to [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5431.360000000001s)]
*  anyone no one's getting mad he's just perfect at it my thing was like to like Darth Vader like I [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5435.6s)]
*  was coming to kill everyone there and it just I didn't want to do it again that people ask me [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5441.28s)]
*  every now and again I'm like it would take it would take a lot it would it would have to be [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5446.4s)]
*  money because I just feel like I've done it and I feel like I did it perfectly right to come back [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5450.4s)]
*  it just I feel the pressure you know I feel the pressure to perform like the audience might be [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5454.8s)]
*  there to see me and they've loved my last four hours but this fifth hour better measure up or [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5458.96s)]
*  I feel terrible so yeah it's just hype yeah and I guess once you do something and doing it well [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5463.759999999999s)]
*  then that's enough knowing when to not do something anymore is important do you think Comedy [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5468.88s)]
*  Central how they messed up I mean they were caught they were the only comedy network [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5474.16s)]
*  Viacom fucked it up for everybody at a time when Disney was buying Marvel at a time where Disney [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5479.12s)]
*  was buying you know like Warner Brothers all this shit Viacom was just like enriching themselves [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5485.4400000000005s)]
*  they weren't investing and then when streaming came along it just wiped them all out but like [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5490.0s)]
*  MTV's gone and Comedy Central still technically around but it's like five people now [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5494.08s)]
*  and they're not getting to stand up that maybe things come back a little bit but it was just [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5498.96s)]
*  they and I've talked to many many people over there over the years about what happened [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5504.32s)]
*  but it's crazy though like you were the comedy network you had comedy yeah I remember it took [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5508.24s)]
*  them forever to get into like social they just didn't they were like so behind somehow so behind [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5514.56s)]
*  yeah just didn't didn't really care that much didn't have to but they're figuring out now [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5519.52s)]
*  they just didn't have they didn't have that good of like they only had a few shows that really [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5524.96s)]
*  crushed it for them I think you know and they wouldn't pay to get three seasons was almost [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5529.52s)]
*  impossible even two was like a stretch I mean look it's like SNL you see the people who like [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5533.84s)]
*  didn't get asked who like auditioned for SNL and didn't get her got fired after a year [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5539.44s)]
*  you know and their careers how amazing it's been like a Sarah Silverman or something [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5542.96s)]
*  that Comedy Central is the same way it's like all these huge stars that like people think [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5548.16s)]
*  Comedy Central let them go it's like they couldn't afford them yeah what John Oliver's [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5552.88s)]
*  what um not John John Oliver's making HBO versus what he made on Comedy Central is insane [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5556.400000000001s)]
*  Stephen Colbert you know had to leave Comedy Central they just didn't have the money there [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5560.88s)]
*  yeah Schumer owed uh Amy Schumer owed them another season I think of her show I don't know if she [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5564.56s)]
*  ended up doing it or not but remember she had the what is this show called inside inside Amy Schumer [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5569.6s)]
*  I think they contractually had one more season that she was supposed to do this because then [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5575.28s)]
*  she just blew up so much that she just didn't and maybe they just did like a buyout of it or [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5579.92s)]
*  something I just remember she did it she did one for Paramount Plus oh she did oh maybe that was [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5585.12s)]
*  it then yeah maybe that was it um I was like I have friends who would like sign a deal get paid and [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5588.96s)]
*  then like hope the network forgets about it oh yeah was like Quibi number Quibi oh yeah god I wish [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5595.92s)]
*  I had taken a deal from them this free money deal yeah they're like here's a hundred grand [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5601.12s)]
*  three weeks later we're totally out of business like what's the best job you've ever had in terms [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5606.72s)]
*  of that like for me it was uh judging roast battle where it was just like every night I go I show up [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5611.76s)]
*  oh yeah like you're you're they're they're paying you amazing and you don't have to prepare anything [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5616.96s)]
*  you just sit there and then they do their bit and then you think of a joke and you say it and then [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5621.84s)]
*  everything looks great and if you mess up they edit it out like it's so cool zero pressure paid [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5626.08s)]
*  a ton and uh and just so much fun I love that that was yeah one of the best jobs I ever had [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5631.679999999999s)]
*  actually was a Comedy Central job it was called um Reality Bites Back I watched I watched Reality [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5637.44s)]
*  Bites Back uh Amy had it all on like DVD and we watched it so good the show was so fucking funny [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5642.719999999999s)]
*  I can't believe it didn't uh like no one watched it but it was it was great I can't believe they [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5648.639999999999s)]
*  didn't start to re-air things that they had that were great but I guess they don't have [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5653.84s)]
*  is that a fiscal maybe they have to rerun it from themselves I don't know how that works [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5657.76s)]
*  I think just no one watched it no one was watching it if they would rerun it they were just like let's [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5661.76s)]
*  let's get rid of this but it had like Schumers on it uh uh Tiffany Haddish Burt Christ like if they [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5665.6s)]
*  put it out now it seemed like it would do fine yeah you would think you know it's it's weird how [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5671.6s)]
*  comedy doesn't live that long even if it is all like the stars of yesterday people just they'd [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5676.16s)]
*  rather watch you now but it's like I can watch like uh Summer Heights High right have you ever [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5681.52s)]
*  seen that oh yeah and uh and they don't it's still get it's still like so ridiculous it still gets [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5686.64s)]
*  me but it's like I mean one of the best shows Comedy Central ever made was um Strangers with [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5693.200000000001s)]
*  the Candy and they never rerun that like ever you have to like you had to find it online I used to [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5697.200000000001s)]
*  buy it on eBay I'd buy like a season on eBay of someone who burned like the DVDs that show was [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5702.160000000001s)]
*  amazing my favorite roast of all time was the roast of Chevy Chase the one that was like a fiasco [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5706.88s)]

*  people would tune in like what do you think about like our Netflix specials like things we've done [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5732.56s)]

*  it's a beautiful town and uh and I went in there and you know what's fascinating the most fascinating [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5764.400000000001s)]
*  was how you used to see you saw so many titles you're over here it's like in Bruges and here's [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5770.320000000001s)]

*  I've never seen this but it was so different than when you go to a platform on your television and [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5793.44s)]
*  you see 10 titles it was another it felt like you actually here's what it felt like I'm realizing [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5800.4800000000005s)]
*  it felt like you actually had a choice in what you were choosing in the blockbuster right then [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5807.84s)]
*  as opposed to on the tv where it feels like this is what you we're serving today even though that's [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5813.84s)]
*  not it you can go look for stuff but it's just not it what it didn't register the same no and [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5818.400000000001s)]

*  the raid too it's kind of like a marshal like a super violent martial arts movie where people [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5840.96s)]
*  are just fighting with like machetes and shit and it's awesome and I see it I'm like this is the [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5844.72s)]

*  funny way to say it like I get what you mean it feels like yeah it just because stuff like that [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5880.5599999999995s)]
*  it's like it's fine but in the end you're just I'm gonna watch what you want me to watch and I won't [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5887.839999999999s)]

*  we kind of understand and the way Netflix is secretive pisses me off then again unless I love [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5917.28s)]
*  Netflix I'm glad I have the specials on there but yeah it's annoying that they're just like they [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5923.76s)]
*  won't you don't know how good something did it can tell you they can say trending not trending you [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5928.48s)]

*  YouTube is interesting too because it's like you can't even talk to someone in the system like [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5970.08s)]
*  they took down an episode that we had and we couldn't even you communicate kind of with like [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5975.44s)]
*  this medium but there's no way to email you don't even know who's in the like who the levels the [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5979.92s)]
*  boss you don't even know who's making the choice it's like really yes it's this ambient sort of [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5987.52s)]
*  you don't know because like I've got a social media team you know they're they're great but [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=5995.120000000001s)]
*  they're like we know we have a guy at Instagram we'll get you verified like right now we have a [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6000.72s)]
*  guy at TikTok we talked to when because all my shit gets taken down all the time and like no it [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6004.160000000001s)]
*  should be okay because of this but they have someone to deal with that I can't believe YouTube [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6008.320000000001s)]
*  doesn't have that with all the I mean there's so much money coming through YouTube I know that I [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6011.84s)]
*  can't believe Mr. Beast doesn't have a guy's number I don't I bet now maybe at that level you do you [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6016.56s)]
*  know but yeah maybe at our level we don't we have a contact there but it's not there's never like [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6022.959999999999s)]
*  you just get the verdict from the contact and that's the verdict it's very like ancient Rome [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6027.759999999999s)]
*  it feels like you know what was the reason they took it down oh Rosanne had a joke she said I [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6033.36s)]
*  remember this yeah that the Holocaust never happened right and she was being satirical right [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6039.28s)]
*  and you know she's also get it you know I think they didn't think she was or they didn't want to [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6044.32s)]
*  hear it you know and so they said that it gets taken down and um and nobody said anything at [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6050.96s)]
*  first and then there's like some of these like baiters online they put the clip out and they're [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6058.72s)]
*  like what about you know and that's when it built up stuff but the only way we can communicate it [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6063.12s)]
*  kind of is through our con we have a contact there that works with YouTube but they never there's [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6067.84s)]
*  never able to have a discussion that's the strange part yeah and that's where I think you start to [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6071.92s)]
*  feel you know like you aren't being heard or you don't have somebody to communicate with [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6076.64s)]
*  I mean I stopped doing that with comedy where I used to be like here's why this joke is okay [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6084.4800000000005s)]
*  you know I mean like I know it's a thing that's about domestic violence but if you look at the [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6088.4800000000005s)]
*  wording no one's getting hit in this joke this is joke is like referencing it but it's for tension [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6091.68s)]
*  and it's always a losing battle I'd be arguing with sensors or something and and now I just [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6096.160000000001s)]
*  if you I can't do it I can't do it fuck it I'm not going to change it but I'll just get rid of it [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6100.400000000001s)]
*  because I'm not going to sit here and have the argument of why this is okay and now I just hope [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6104.4s)]
*  that people understand like I've got a lot of topics that I talk about that would get people [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6107.92s)]
*  in trouble but I've gotten away with it I don't know if it's reputation or people just know now [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6112.4s)]
*  that no he did it in the right way he got away with it but like it goes back to what you're saying [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6116.16s)]
*  there's a way to get away like what'd you say in the beginning you said art is getting away with it [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxR0GOFWa2k&t=6121.12s)]
