*  Totally unheard of for somebody who hadn't been [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=281.74s)]
*  in Nashville really studying the craft, so to say, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=285.62s)]
*  to show up with songs like Neon Moon and Bootscoot. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=289.1s)]

*  just had written all these great songs by itself, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=296.42s)]
*  which you know, now I can't even tell you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  who's out there writing songs by themselves. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=301.94s)]
*  They'll probably watch and go, hey, how about me dude? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=303.94s)]
*  But you know, it's, it's a co-writing town. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=306.1s)]
*  It just really is. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=309.26s)]
*  It's becoming more and more of a co-writing town. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=310.5s)]
*  I last time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  More and more writers on every song. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=312.98s)]
*  A solo with nine writers. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  A solo with nine writers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=316.54s)]

*  Did it feel like over, did it feel like you guys had to, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=324.3s)]
*  cause I bet it's like, once you get partnered with somebody, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=327.86s)]
*  it's like, dang, we're part, this is a long ride. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=331.54s)]
*  And you don't really know how long the ride is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=333.78s)]
*  when you start, you know? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=335.42s)]
*  Did it feel like you guys over the years, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=337.02s)]
*  like you had to be best friends? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=338.5s)]
*  Did it ever feel like a pressure to be like that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=340.02s)]
*  Maybe, but we didn't, I don't think we, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=343.18s)]
*  we took it to heart. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it was like, hey, we, Tim, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=346.38s)]
*  back up on your story a little bit for me, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=349.42s)]
*  but Tim had heard me in a plant a bar in Oklahoma [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=351.34s)]
*  and he was circling through and Clive Davis [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=355.18s)]
*  and he were putting a label together. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=358.74s)]
*  So he told me, he says, I really, I want to sign. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=361.06s)]
*  He said, I've already got Alan Jackson and Diamond Rio. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  He already had a boy singer and a band and a girl. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=368.62s)]
*  Yeah, Pam Tillis. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's like, he's like, he's going down the list. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=372.06s)]
*  We didn't realize this at first, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=374.06s)]
*  but he was going down the list going, okay, now I need a, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  I said, trio, I've got a trio, now I need a duo. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=377.66s)]
*  But he didn't, we didn't know that till after the fact. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=380.82s)]
*  The judge were breaking up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=384.62s)]
*  So he saw an open slot on the CMAs. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=385.9s)]
*  I think. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=389.86s)]
*  It might have been true. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=390.7s)]
*  It was true, I think it was that manipulative. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=392.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=394.54s)]
*  Yeah, I saw you guys do your walkout with Morgan. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=395.58s)]
*  How was that, man? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=397.22s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=398.06s)]
*  He's got it stirred up and it's like, okay, so where do we? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=399.38s)]
*  How about that kid? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=404.9s)]
*  Did you know about it before what it was or no? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=406.62s)]
*  I really didn't. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=408.9s)]
*  They were trying to explain to me what was going on. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=409.94s)]
*  And like, Morgan will look back [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=412.58s)]
*  and you guys come down the hallway [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=414.42s)]
*  and then y'all are going to walk out together to his stage. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=415.7s)]
*  You know, we're going to film it and it's a big deal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=418.54s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=420.54s)]
*  We keep up with it to the extent that we know how [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=423.86s)]
*  he's selling out stadiums everywhere. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=425.66s)]
*  And it's like, you know, get out of the way [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=427.26s)]
*  and he's crashing websites and live nation is, you know, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=428.58s)]
*  if you announce ticket sales at all, you know, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=432.3s)]
*  it blows up through the roof. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=434.38s)]
*  So, and I had, I had a walk on with him at Bridgestone [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=435.9s)]
*  when he played here a couple of years ago. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=440.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, I saw that show actually. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=441.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=443.34s)]
*  I was at that show, yeah. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=444.18s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=445.02s)]
*  But yeah, to do that is kind of an interesting thing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=446.18s)]
*  because you're back there, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=448.02s)]
*  you don't really know what's going on, you know? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=448.86s)]
*  You can kind of start to hear people cheering [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=451.34s)]
*  but you don't really know. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=453.41999999999996s)]
*  So did you do that with him? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=454.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I got to do one with him here in Nashville. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=455.82s)]
*  Yeah, with Deandre Hopkins that plays [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=460.14s)]
*  for the Tennessee Titans. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=461.98s)]
*  Uh huh, yeah, sure. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=463.54s)]
*  But it's still kind of confusing because you're like. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=464.94s)]
*  J-hop. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=466.94s)]

*  Deandre. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=471.58s)]
*  No, but we didn't, when I did it, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=474.42s)]
*  we didn't, he wasn't doing the walk yet. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=475.62s)]
*  So we were in Kansas City the other night with him. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=477.62s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=480.18s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=486.7s)]
*  Yeah, because it's kind of wild. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=488.42s)]
*  It's just this thing, I guess they kind of just started it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=490.18s)]
*  Yeah, you don't know, yeah, you're right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=492.85999999999996s)]

*  Yeah, you just kind of don't know what's going on. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=496.46s)]
*  Well, am I supposed to walk here and be cool? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=498.46s)]

*  Yeah, it had to be weird because you get to the stage [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=543.4599999999999s)]
*  and then you guys can't go out to the stage. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=545.3s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, it's like, yeah, we're on. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=546.94s)]
*  It's like, stop. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=549.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=550.4200000000001s)]
*  No, this is not your show. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=551.2600000000001s)]
*  Stop hearing the cameras all follow that guy. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=553.94s)]
*  Yeah, it really was like that, man. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=556.2600000000001s)]
*  Cause I didn't even play anything when I was like, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=558.1400000000001s)]
*  I could try, you know, I was like, let's do it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=559.46s)]
*  You know? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=562.1s)]
*  That's how we were, you just wing it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=562.94s)]
*  Give me some bang on. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=564.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=565.5400000000001s)]
*  And DeAndre's like, he looked like he was ready [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=566.46s)]
*  to just run a 40 yard F flat, you know? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=568.1s)]
*  So I was like, yeah, let's get him out here, dude. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=571.4200000000001s)]
*  So that was interesting, man. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=574.34s)]
*  What's been one of the tougher things [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=577.7s)]
*  that came with like fame that you guys realized? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=579.22s)]
*  Cause you guys went to being, obviously you were doing well [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=582.1400000000001s)]
*  in your careers individually, but even as you were just [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=585.3800000000001s)]
*  saying like, you know, you guys, the first couple songs [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=588.2600000000001s)]
*  you put out were hits. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=591.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=593.6600000000001s)]
*  First four were number ones. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=594.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot of number ones, dude, you know? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=596.2600000000001s)]
*  We just called some buddies up in a panic [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  and started playing honky-tonks and bars. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  Even our manager told us not to do it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=604.0200000000001s)]
*  I said, no, man, if we're running off, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=605.5s)]
*  like we're knocking hits out of the park right now, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=607.62s)]
*  we need to have a tight band, you know, when they do, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=610.5s)]
*  or we get to a place where we're in front [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=613.86s)]
*  of a lot of people. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=615.54s)]
*  So we went for the first year, year and a half, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=616.42s)]
*  playing clubs everywhere from here to California. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=619.46s)]
*  Which was the coolest. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=622.74s)]
*  It was animal house. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=624.02s)]
*  The coolest memory, the coolest memory for me, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=624.86s)]
*  because I probably like Ronnie, I mean, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=629.34s)]
*  just a lot of years of turning corners on clubs and stuff. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=631.82s)]
*  And then there'd be four or six cars in the parking lot, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=636.46s)]
*  you know, and you just have to go and set up. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=638.7800000000001s)]
*  One of them's yours too. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=640.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=641.46s)]
*  And one of them's a girl you came to invite to impress. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=642.3000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=645.82s)]
*  And a couple of guys that don't like you [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=646.6600000000001s)]
*  because they want her too. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=648.34s)]
*  And she's not cute at all. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=649.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you set your stuff up, you know, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=654.4200000000001s)]
*  and nobody cares and whatever. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=656.58s)]
*  And then next thing you know, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=658.02s)]
*  we're parking down the road to get to a place [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=659.82s)]
*  because the parking lot's full. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=663.1s)]
*  Those were great nights. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=664.9399999999999s)]
*  They really were. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=666.06s)]
*  You know, you really couldn't screw up too bad [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=666.9399999999999s)]
*  because it was fired up. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=670.26s)]
*  And that's kind of what you dream about [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=671.74s)]
*  when you're learning to tune your guitar, you know. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=674.22s)]
*  Just, man, just the clubs part of it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=676.86s)]
*  I mean, the whole Coliseum thing [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=679.62s)]
*  and that other kind of success was, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=681.78s)]
*  I wasn't even thinking that far. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=685.42s)]
*  This was just like, man, it worked. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=686.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=689.3s)]
*  It was so crazy because we don't know each other from Adam. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=690.14s)]
*  Even at that point, we don't know each other from Adam. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=693.02s)]
*  We would learn in interviews about one another. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=695.54s)]
*  About each other? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=697.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=698.54s)]
*  Like, I didn't know you did that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=699.38s)]
*  Now, as you started to get famous, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=700.22s)]
*  I'm just curious about this kind of stuff, you know, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=701.62s)]
*  because fame and popularity is such like a, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=703.26s)]
*  it's an interesting thing, right? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=705.66s)]
*  And it's its own thing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=707.34s)]
*  because you can't exactly plan for it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=708.38s)]
*  Like, were there things that you kind of missed [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=711.02s)]
*  kind of immediately about that? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=713.8199999999999s)]
*  Like, because once you kind of, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=715.42s)]
*  once it starts to happen, it's hard to put it, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=717.86s)]
*  you can't really put your life back into that old jug, really. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=719.66s)]
*  No, and you don't see it coming. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=723.14s)]
*  You can't plan for it, no matter where it is. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=723.98s)]
*  I think, you know, even if you grew up around it, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=726.02s)]
*  which I didn't, but I can, this is so strange, though. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=727.94s)]
*  I can remember going home after the first, like say run, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=731.22s)]
*  the real like tour, when we were opening for Reber or whatever. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=734.7s)]
*  And my wife and brother-in-law going, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=738.26s)]
*  she said, you've changed. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=744.38s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=746.46s)]
*  She said, you changed. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=748.38s)]
*  She said, you're not the same. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=749.38s)]
*  And I was like, I didn't feel like anything was any abnormal [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=750.86s)]
*  other than I was going out on a bus [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=755.42s)]
*  and singing in front of people. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=756.9s)]
*  I didn't come back going, you know, hey, I'm famous. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=757.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=760.42s)]
*  But people's perception of you changes, you know? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=761.9s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=765.98s)]
*  Yeah, and that, yeah, it is. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=766.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it's kind of uncomfortable because you don't, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=768.22s)]
*  you kind of wish it wouldn't. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=771.22s)]
*  Well, you need that safety net of normalcy, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  you know, to come back to, especially at home. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=776.06s)]
*  And it was just kind of, all of a sudden [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=778.66s)]
*  you're getting pushed in the corner in a way [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=781.42s)]
*  by that whatever perception is of fame. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=783.66s)]
*  I just did a bunch of acid, so we're heavy with this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=788.06s)]
*  Oh, I'm not even here. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=790.66s)]
*  You're not, you're not. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=792.66s)]
*  This shit's just coming out of the cosmic space, right? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=794.06s)]
*  Of mushroom, not acid, acid's out. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=797.62s)]
*  I think that it's funny, I'm just, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=799.5s)]
*  my wheels are turning just thinking about those times. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=801.26s)]
*  And honestly, I love, somebody made a statement one time [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=804.9s)]
*  or having a conversation like this and said, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=809.06s)]
*  yeah, I want to be a star, I want to be a star, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=811.26s)]
*  I want to be a star, will you people please leave me alone? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=812.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, I've never felt that way. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=815.62s)]
*  You know, I mean, like Ronnie for so many years, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=817.9799999999999s)]
*  we were, I was 36, he was 38 when we met, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=821.54s)]
*  you know, with nothing going on really. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=824.74s)]
*  And I mean, that's, that's a, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=827.4599999999999s)]
*  that's pretty old to just get started with a career [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=830.78s)]
*  where you're put together by a record company [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=834.26s)]
*  and to think you're going to have a 30 year plus run [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=836.38s)]
*  or something, you know? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=839.54s)]
*  Well, we didn't think about the 30 plus year run. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=840.38s)]
*  I know, that's what I mean. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=842.34s)]
*  Our philosophy was, hey, you got three, three to five years. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=843.38s)]
*  All right, let's maximize it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=846.66s)]
*  Let's take what little money we make. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=848.34s)]
*  And I was going to go, our big, Janine, my wife and I [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=850.18s)]
*  just, just got married in Oklahoma. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=853.86s)]
*  So our goal was, you know what? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=856.42s)]
*  Interest rates are like 10%. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=858.14s)]
*  And this was back, don't see how far back it was. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=860.34s)]
*  Interest rates are 10%, we make a million dollars, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=863.18s)]
*  we can live off a hundred thousand dollars a year [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=865.5799999999999s)]
*  and live like kings. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=868.42s)]
*  That we drove up to the first house, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=870.78s)]
*  bought this little house in Nashville, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=872.6999999999999s)]
*  we go, we're just here for a little while, save your money. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=874.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=877.4599999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I don't know if you remember this, Ronnie, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=878.3s)]
*  but we were, we were sitting in the Nashville airport, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=881.38s)]
*  just shooting the bull. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=884.6999999999999s)]
*  And we've always just, I guess, had kind of a natural, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=885.66s)]
*  just a couple of guys and we're smart asses, just, you know, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=890.2199999999999s)]
*  just goofballing all the time, talking to people, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=893.0999999999999s)]
*  just like we are today. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=895.8199999999999s)]
*  And anyway, these two girls came over and I saw three of them [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=896.9399999999999s)]
*  over there talking and they came over and asked if they [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=902.02s)]
*  could get an autograph and they had a CD and whatever. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=904.4599999999999s)]
*  And you know, we just shot the bull back and forth [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=907.4599999999999s)]
*  a little bit and whatever. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=909.9399999999999s)]
*  And I mean, they were sweet, whenever we signed their CDs [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=910.9399999999999s)]
*  and I've always been happy to do that. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=914.2199999999999s)]
*  Glad anybody cares, you know? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=916.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=918.54s)]
*  And a couple of minutes later, their friend comes over [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=919.38s)]
*  and said, our friends told us what you said, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=922.14s)]
*  we're getting rid of all our CDs, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=924.46s)]
*  we've always thought y'all were so great. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=925.9s)]
*  I mean, just teed up on us. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=928.02s)]
*  And we're looking at each other and going, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=930.26s)]
*  I'm trying to remember this conversation, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=932.46s)]
*  what I could have possibly said that, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=934.66s)]
*  and I mean, I like to think of myself as a good guy, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=938.14s)]
*  nice guy, and I've always respected our fans [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=941.38s)]
*  and everything else. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=944.74s)]
*  I'm like, what just happened? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=945.5799999999999s)]
*  But it made me realize that moment, that minute, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=948.06s)]
*  that we spent together totally wrapped somebody's impression [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=954.26s)]
*  of you and what kind of human you are, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=959.02s)]
*  and how they'll tell everybody they meet [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=961.18s)]
*  for the rest of their lives that they're just jerks. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=963.14s)]
*  You know, and you just, that's the part. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=966.1s)]
*  Did you ever find out what you said? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=968.14s)]
*  I have no idea what we said, you were involved. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=969.62s)]
*  No, don't get me in this. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=972.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=973.3s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=975.22s)]
*  I wasn't there, I wasn't there. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=976.42s)]
*  Don't pull, don't suck me down that rabbit hole. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=978.42s)]
*  It does feel like you get on this one minute game show [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=981.54s)]
*  to prove to somebody that you're okay or something. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=984.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=986.9s)]
*  Yeah, that stuff, it's like. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=988.1s)]
*  It's like a job interview, you gotta be quick. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=989.66s)]
*  Yeah, and the job is you want them to think you're okay [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=991.5s)]
*  or something, you know? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=996.86s)]
*  You're the guy for the job in one minute. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=997.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1000.22s)]
*  You can do it, I can't. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1001.22s)]
*  Yeah, that kind of stuff gets a little tricky. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1002.38s)]
*  Was it tough, like, what about having a family [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1004.34s)]
*  and stuff and touring so much? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1007.74s)]
*  Like, what were things that like, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1008.9s)]
*  what's that like? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1011.9399999999999s)]
*  Like, is it hectic? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1012.78s)]
*  Dude, I had just been married. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1015.22s)]
*  I mean, we just got married, came up, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1018.02s)]
*  and June Carter Cash gave us a little cabin [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1019.9399999999999s)]
*  on top of the hill, not far from their house to live in. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1022.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1026.66s)]
*  And so, nice little house, like something out of a magazine, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1027.5s)]
*  but it was on top of a mountain by itself. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1033.86s)]
*  And so was she. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1037.02s)]
*  Boom, we get a hit right out of the gate. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1038.5400000000002s)]
*  We're gone. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1042.0200000000002s)]
*  And it wasn't too long. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1044.2600000000002s)]
*  It's like, I mean, we didn't have, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1046.14s)]
*  we had like cell phones, but we didn't have cameras. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1049.3000000000002s)]
*  But I started getting these terrorist faxes, I called them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1052.9s)]
*  Like, she would fax the hotel, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1057.46s)]
*  because I talked longer than we talked. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1059.22s)]
*  So long on the phone, they go, okay, all right, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1060.6200000000001s)]
*  I'll be home in two weeks. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1063.74s)]
*  I know, I understand. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1065.5s)]
*  I get it, I love you. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1067.18s)]
*  Ring, I'm not answering the phone. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1069.1s)]
*  That ain't gonna happen. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1073.1s)]
*  So not 10 minutes later, I get this knock on the door, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1074.62s)]
*  and it's like they slide this stack of faxes underneath. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1078.02s)]
*  So she started faxing me. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1081.3799999999999s)]
*  It's like, what the hell? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1083.5s)]
*  And this goes on for, I don't know, a few months, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1086.02s)]
*  and we sorted it out. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1087.98s)]
*  But to this day, I mean, then she's been. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1089.26s)]
*  It was. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1091.34s)]
*  I had to go to therapy over it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1092.18s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1093.26s)]
*  With her or without her? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1094.3s)]
*  With her, at her request, obviously. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1095.98s)]
*  Because I'm broken, she's not. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1098.98s)]
*  Anyway, that's a long thing. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1099.98s)]
*  Eric Chenault had one of those. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1102.06s)]
*  Because we had a cell phone, per se, on tour, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1104.26s)]
*  but it was like something that the Army would use. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1107.98s)]
*  It had a suitcase thing that it was in and all that. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1110.42s)]
*  The second you pressed a button, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1113.22s)]
*  a helicopter would come behind. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1114.18s)]
*  Like 18 bucks a minute. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1116.46s)]
*  A long way from. 18 bucks a minute. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1118.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1120.38s)]
*  Bro, I think. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1121.22s)]
*  It's important, yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1123.26s)]
*  It wasn't cheap, man. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1124.1000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't, yeah, but it wasn't with our wives or anything. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1125.1399999999999s)]
*  We were a little. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1128.58s)]
*  No, we didn't give our wives a number. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1129.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1131.02s)]
*  It's important. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1131.86s)]
*  I'm going broke. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1133.6999999999998s)]
*  It's strictly a beer phone. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1134.74s)]
*  It peaks it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1138.1399999999999s)]
*  You're like, we need a air drop now. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1139.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1141.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, I recently had a subscription [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1143.78s)]
*  that I'd forgot about. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1145.4199999999998s)]
*  It was a content monitoring app [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1146.6999999999998s)]
*  that I was using on my phone and computer. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1151.54s)]
*  Thankfully, Rocket Money helped me. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1154.3s)]
*  Can you name every single subscription you have? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1157.58s)]
*  I know I can't name all of mine, no doubt. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1160.74s)]
*  And I'm not alone. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1163.4199999999998s)]

*  for one of you guys. It was tough, man. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1523.1s)]
*  It was rough. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1523.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1524.78s)]
*  So in the first truck stop, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1525.62s)]
*  I go in and I'm looking at all their cool stuff. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1527.5s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, I'm gonna throw this in the freezer [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1529.7s)]
*  in Canada. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1531.7s)]

*  It was a frozen eel in the freezer. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1533.38s)]
*  And I'm like, wow. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1535.5s)]
*  So I bought it. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1537.02s)]
*  I mean, I have no idea what I'm gonna do with this, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1538.18s)]
*  but I couldn't resist. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1540.7s)]
*  That was a phase when everybody started in road. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1542.66s)]
*  But that was a phase when everybody was playing pranks [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1544.26s)]
*  on the road. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1546.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1547.5800000000002s)]
*  Faith was like, she was one of the guys. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1548.42s)]
*  I mean, you had to have to keep up with that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1549.94s)]
*  She would throw stuff. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1551.94s)]
*  And an eel could come in handy. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1552.78s)]
*  Curd balls. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1554.3000000000002s)]
*  In all kinds of regards. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1555.14s)]
*  And who'd even had an eel? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1555.98s)]
*  I don't even, some people don't even- [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1557.22s)]
*  Canadians. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1558.42s)]
*  I think that was the point. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1560.42s)]
*  It's why you bought it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1561.26s)]
*  It's like, look at this. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1562.1000000000001s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1562.94s)]
*  It's kind of a little bit of a nicer snake. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1563.78s)]
*  It's the most Canadian thing. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1565.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1567.0600000000002s)]
*  But we get to the end of the tour and sure enough, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1567.9s)]
*  I walked by, we're fixing to go to the stage. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1570.14s)]
*  Faith is on next. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1573.5s)]
*  And Wade Hayes had just gotten off stage. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1575.14s)]
*  I went by to tell him, good show and whatever. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1577.14s)]
*  And he's kind of leaned over. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1579.0600000000002s)]
*  He's looking pretty peaking. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1580.1000000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, you okay? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1581.74s)]
*  He's like, no man's like, Faith put salt in my drink [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1583.22s)]
*  and water on stage. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1586.46s)]
*  And I go, oh. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1587.5800000000002s)]
*  And he was- [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1588.66s)]
*  Made him sick. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1589.5s)]
*  Made him sick. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1590.3400000000001s)]
*  So I'm like, that's wrong. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1591.18s)]
*  I got you dude. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1592.02s)]
*  So she was at- [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1593.1000000000001s)]
*  Get your back bro. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1594.54s)]
*  She's in a hotel, but we had the codes to her room [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1595.38s)]
*  and her fictitious name, whatever she was using at the time. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1599.14s)]
*  So me and Doug make a run. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1602.54s)]
*  Well, first I put the eel in the microwave [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1605.26s)]
*  and the eel didn't even have a head. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1608.94s)]
*  I mean, once you've thawed him out, he got real slimy. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1611.38s)]
*  So we had over there- [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1615.1000000000001s)]
*  Heartbreaking childhood it must have had. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1616.74s)]
*  You know it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1618.74s)]
*  And- [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1619.58s)]
*  You bring your own food. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1620.4199999999998s)]
*  Pull back the covers and just laid him out [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1621.82s)]
*  right where those pretty little feets were gonna go. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1625.54s)]
*  You know, kind of pushed it down. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1627.6599999999999s)]
*  So we put the covers back, just made it look really good. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1629.4599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, and the next, didn't hear a thing. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1632.74s)]
*  She didn't say anything. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1635.4199999999998s)]
*  We just keep waiting for the other shoe to fall. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1636.54s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1638.5s)]
*  So we're going through customs, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1639.6599999999999s)]
*  getting back into the States the next day. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1641.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, inside I die. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1643.3s)]
*  And I go through and you know, lady's going, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1644.54s)]
*  Mr. Brooks, I go, yes. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1648.5s)]
*  She goes, I need you to come over here to the side. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1649.78s)]
*  And I go, yeah. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1651.46s)]
*  She goes, apparently there's been a complaint filed against [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1652.3s)]
*  you about some stolen jewelry by Ms. Faith Hill. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1656.66s)]
*  And she starts pulling this rubber glove on. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1660.02s)]
*  And I go, don't do that. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1662.5s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1664.82s)]
*  It ain't in there. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1665.66s)]
*  That- [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1666.5s)]
*  No, I'm sorry. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1667.34s)]
*  No. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1668.5s)]
*  You better not be kidding her. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1669.34s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1671.34s)]
*  She couldn't hold it. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1672.82s)]
*  Now she finally broke. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1675.66s)]
*  Come on. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1677.26s)]
*  It's not our first day. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1678.1s)]
*  Leave me alone. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1681.06s)]
*  You're not even in this game. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1682.18s)]
*  You do think a little higher that night. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1685.94s)]
*  The world was fun then too, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1688.66s)]
*  when things were a little bit more simple, you know? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1689.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1691.98s)]
*  You know? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1692.82s)]
*  In a lot of ways. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1693.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1694.5s)]
*  That was a lot of fun, man. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1695.9s)]
*  And you couldn't capture the moment as much. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1697.38s)]
*  So you had to enjoy the moment because that was the only, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1699.1s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1701.54s)]

*  I mean, it was not, you know, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1703.78s)]
*  if you're not on stage doing something creative, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1705.02s)]
*  you're doing something destructively creative [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1707.3400000000001s)]

*  I've seen a lot of like, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1765.06s)]
*  because committees you go to the next club [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1766.18s)]
*  and the other person's just been there, you know? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1767.6200000000001s)]
*  And I've seen a lot of his, you know, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1769.54s)]
*  seen his name a ton over the years, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1772.02s)]
*  but I've never gotten to watch him. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1773.5s)]
*  Been around forever. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1774.34s)]
*  But he actually performed a song and it was, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1775.54s)]
*  I bet this thing had 20 verses. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1778.38s)]
*  And it was, it was, I'm not kidding. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1780.82s)]
*  It was like, but it was a real country music analog [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1783.22s)]
*  kind of take you through this whole journey of thing. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1787.38s)]
*  It was really neat. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1789.54s)]
*  Big time stand to know [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1791.14s)]
*  because I've seen him perform. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1792.66s)]
*  I don't even know how many times at this point. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1794.5800000000002s)]
*  And, and everybody there was like, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1797.1000000000001s)]
*  wow, you got that off your chest. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1800.0600000000002s)]
*  And he did not tell a single joke. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1802.1000000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1804.0600000000002s)]
*  He sang that one song and left the stage. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1804.9s)]
*  So it was so cool. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1807.5800000000002s)]
*  But it was a humorous song. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1808.78s)]
*  No, it wasn't funny. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1810.26s)]
*  It was, it was a real song. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1811.14s)]
*  It was, it was neat. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1813.5800000000002s)]
*  But he was a comedian. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1814.74s)]
*  He is a comedian. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1815.5800000000002s)]
*  He's a great comedian, yeah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1816.4s)]
*  Maybe that's his ideal comedy. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1817.5800000000002s)]
*  Him and Roger Miller, him and Roger Miller [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1819.1000000000001s)]
*  toured together. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1821.38s)]
*  And you've heard of people doing these Rogerisms, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1822.5s)]
*  these funny things that he told all, he knows all of them. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1824.74s)]
*  I mean, if you ever run into him, get him going on Roger. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1827.94s)]
*  Cause he's, he's one of the great historians, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1830.66s)]
*  the keepers of the Rogerisms too. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1833.94s)]
*  Great guy, funny comedian. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1836.38s)]
*  Yeah, I need to run into him. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1838.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. What do you feel like, like, like being a duo, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1839.8600000000001s)]
*  was there, were there other duos that like in music [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1843.14s)]
*  that reached out to you guys over the years [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1847.18s)]
*  to help learn how to navigate [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1848.7800000000002s)]
*  that like that template kind of, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1852.22s)]
*  does that make any sense to you? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1855.26s)]
*  Yeah, it does make sense, but no, no. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1857.82s)]
*  As friendly as they say that, you know, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1861.06s)]
*  the world of country music is, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1862.86s)]
*  it's so darn competitive. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1864.3s)]
*  Everybody hates one another. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1866.1s)]
*  They act like they don't on TV. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1867.54s)]
*  You think people are really competitive though? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1870.34s)]
*  Oh, heck yeah. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1871.78s)]
*  No, big time competitive. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1872.62s)]
*  One of my favorite things is Dolly Parton [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1874.7s)]
*  in an interview years and years ago. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1876.3s)]
*  She said they were talking about somebody and being, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1877.58s)]
*  she just goes, oh honey, there's room for everybody. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1879.98s)]
*  No, there's not. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1883.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1883.9s)]
*  You want to get down to it? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1884.74s)]
*  No, there's not. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1885.78s)]
*  What's the most competitive part? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1887.74s)]
*  Is it people trying to get the best songs? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1889.1s)]
*  Is it like, where does the competition really come in? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1891.5s)]
*  Do you feel like, cause that's interesting. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1895.14s)]
*  I think just by nature to be here and be in this game, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1897.02s)]
*  in your game or anything, that there's a competitive, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1900.06s)]
*  don't you feel? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1903.74s)]
*  There's a competitive dynamic that runs through it. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1904.74s)]
*  Especially in the beginning for sure. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1908.42s)]
*  Yeah, but you would catch it like, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1910.9s)]
*  how many number ones do you have? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1911.8600000000001s)]
*  Who had her number one this week? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1912.8200000000002s)]
*  Who has it? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1914.14s)]
*  And we can be cool and like set back and go, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1915.3000000000002s)]
*  we don't care. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1917.3400000000001s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1918.66s)]
*  We're not in it for that. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1919.5s)]
*  We're in it for the love. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1920.3400000000001s)]
*  And that's not the case. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1922.18s)]
*  But that's also healthy. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1924.9s)]
*  That's what keeps you going. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1925.74s)]
*  We do make some real friends along the way. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1927.3000000000002s)]
*  We have. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1929.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean, you do. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1930.6200000000001s)]
*  There are people that you're competent. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1931.66s)]
*  I mean, David Lee Murphy is a great example. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1936.1s)]
*  He wrote with him yesterday. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1939.1s)]
*  You know the song dust on the bottle? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1941.02s)]
*  I be a little dust David Lee Murphy knows. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1942.78s)]
*  Him singing, him writing, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1945.34s)]
*  turned into writing a lot of great songs too. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1947.22s)]
*  And we got here, both got here in 79, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1950.62s)]
*  literally swept floors for Charlie Daniels [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1953.1799999999998s)]
*  for 30 bucks a night. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1955.74s)]
*  I was getting rent paid and playing writers nights and stuff. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1957.3799999999999s)]
*  And still he's on tour with us now. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1961.62s)]
*  You know, going out with this next year, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1965.78s)]
*  again last year and we've toured together before. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1968.1000000000001s)]
*  Just we've got real friends that the competition, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1970.22s)]
*  I can't say, I don't know, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1976.3s)]
*  maybe it does go away or something. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1978.1000000000001s)]
*  And at some point in your life, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1979.8200000000002s)]
*  I think you have a certain amount of success. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1981.42s)]
*  You still want to succeed, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1983.5s)]
*  but it's like, you're not so ferocious. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1985.5800000000002s)]
*  Like when you start and everything matters [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1989.5s)]
*  it's not that everything doesn't matter anymore, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1992.82s)]
*  but it's like everything kind of turned down [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1995.46s)]
*  the heat a little bit. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1998.5s)]
*  You know, let's simmer here [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=1999.74s)]
*  and see if we can't do something real, something good. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2000.86s)]
*  Now we kind of know you build confidence too. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2003.86s)]
*  Again, like I said, Ronnie and I, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2006.9s)]
*  we didn't figure we'd go a year or two. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2008.3799999999999s)]
*  That's why we were desperate through, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2010.54s)]
*  pretty much through our whole career is just kind of, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2013.74s)]
*  this isn't going to work. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2016.7s)]
*  This, we're always doubting ourselves. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2017.7s)]
*  Always trying to do anything we could, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2020.54s)]
*  what, to do something really special [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2022.78s)]
*  because it's probably going to be our last song, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2025.4599999999998s)]
*  our last video. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2028.26s)]
*  I mean, we've always kind of felt a little desperate, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2029.78s)]
*  I think. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2032.6999999999998s)]
*  Does it feel like it's out of your control sometimes [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2033.54s)]
*  as a musician? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2036.02s)]
*  Because a lot of it is what songs you get, right? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2036.86s)]
*  And you can write your own songs, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2039.1s)]
*  you can write them with other people, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2040.78s)]
*  but does it ever feel like it's out of your control? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2042.54s)]
*  Kind of like how well you keep doing [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2044.58s)]
*  or does it feel like it's in your control? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2047.3s)]
*  You know what this is. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2048.9s)]
*  I mean, 60, 70%, I don't know how much you can add [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2050.26s)]

*  We're good. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2302.9s)]
*  Don't touch it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2303.74s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have a pencil. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2304.58s)]
*  Like, hey, that paper likes men. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2305.5s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2307.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2308.1s)]
*  So you guys got to meet Johnny Cash? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2309.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2311.5s)]
*  No way. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2312.34s)]
*  What was he like, like, just as a regular guy? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2313.18s)]
*  Was he like a friendly guy? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2315.2200000000003s)]
*  Was he kind of like a stoic guy? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2316.62s)]
*  Stoic, quiet by nature when you first meet him. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2318.34s)]
*  Just, and that in and of itself is intimidating. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2320.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2324.7s)]
*  And then as you get to know him, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2325.54s)]
*  he's a 17-year-old kid. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2327.18s)]
*  That was it. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2330.46s)]
*  I mean, he's crazy. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2331.38s)]
*  Funny as all get out. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2334.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2335.74s)]
*  My wife, her first husband, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2336.58s)]
*  in ridding the car one piece at a time, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2340.7799999999997s)]
*  and Johnny sang about it one piece at a time. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2343.94s)]
*  Or built that car. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2347.18s)]
*  He built the car. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2348.1s)]
*  Oh, built that car one piece at a time. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2348.94s)]
*  I'm sorry, yeah. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2350.18s)]
*  The song. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2351.02s)]
*  He built the car, so he... [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2351.86s)]
*  Or Johnny really built the car? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2354.5s)]
*  Sorry, I'm confused. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2355.62s)]
*  No, her ex-wife built the car about the song [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2356.58s)]
*  that Johnny sang called One Piece at a Time. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2360.02s)]
*  Got it. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2361.46s)]
*  He liked the song, and him and his bud said, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2362.2999999999997s)]
*  let's build it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2364.1800000000003s)]
*  Let's actually build it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2365.02s)]
*  They were always going around. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2365.86s)]
*  They owned strip coal mines in Oklahoma. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2366.7000000000003s)]
*  And he... [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2369.26s)]
*  Johnny did? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2370.6600000000003s)]
*  Or his friends? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2371.5s)]
*  No, Janine, my wife's. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2372.34s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2373.34s)]
*  Yeah, so they were well acquainted. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2374.1800000000003s)]
*  They all became fast friends, traveled the world together. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2376.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, really, really tight. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2379.02s)]
*  And so when I was brought in, her husband passed away. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2381.42s)]
*  And when I was brought in, it's like she's marrying [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2387.46s)]
*  or dating a musician. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2391.98s)]
*  Janine goes, I'm gonna take you to John and June's house [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2396.9s)]
*  in Nashville the first time that she did it from Oklahoma. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2399.18s)]
*  And I went, no, I don't really wanna do that. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2402.06s)]
*  I just kinda saw that one coming. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2404.78s)]
*  And Johnny, and of course, John's real quiet. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2407.5s)]
*  Would you wear over that? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2410.94s)]
*  Did you get dressed up or what? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2411.78s)]
*  Black, all black. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2413.18s)]
*  No, I mean, jeans, what I have on now, this kind of stuff. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2415.14s)]
*  Were you nervous or not? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2419.06s)]
*  You remember? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2419.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2420.82s)]
*  I was super shy and quiet. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2422.22s)]
*  And then I'm gonna kinda come out of my shell [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2423.98s)]
*  a little bit these days. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2425.3399999999997s)]
*  He was obviously glad to see her. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2429.54s)]
*  I mean, I'm the new kid on the block. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2431.18s)]

*  Yeah, your girlfriend's bringing you [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2435.54s)]
*  over to meet her parents. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2436.8599999999997s)]
*  Who's this pervert or whatever, yeah. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2438.06s)]
*  I don't know you, but I mean, I'm a pervert. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2440.94s)]
*  So I'm sure most of us all are. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2443.62s)]
*  That goes with it. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2444.94s)]
*  You can't be in a band and not be a pervert. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2445.7799999999997s)]
*  Anyway, and Johnny knew that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2447.94s)]
*  He'd be a pervert himself. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2451.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, who isn't, man? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2455.3399999999997s)]

*  cause now he's almost, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2472.74s)]
*  there's an idolatry about him in a way. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2474.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, you see the t-shirts with the Johnny Cash [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2476.18s)]
*  and just his cash, something like. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2478.46s)]

*  called her and said, look, okay, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2490.5800000000004s)]
*  this guy's gonna run around making the music business. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2492.2200000000003s)]
*  Good luck, it ain't gonna happen, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2494.5400000000004s)]

*  till I find you a guy with money. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2504.42s)]
*  So thank God we had these hits right off the bat [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2507.42s)]
*  and suddenly June goes, woo, okay, you're in. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2509.98s)]
*  You know, she told Janine during that first visit, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2512.42s)]
*  she said, look, here's how it goes down. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2516.46s)]
*  She says, the odds are a million to one, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2518.22s)]
*  no, 10 billion to one, you know, that they'll make it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2522.86s)]
*  And if he does, it's not gonna last long. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2525.98s)]
*  It's just, that's not, that's the nature of the business. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2529.22s)]

*  And they're, John's quiet anyway. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2590.9s)]
*  He doesn't, he hasn't like- [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2594.0200000000004s)]
*  And what's he, just polishing a gun or something? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2596.5800000000004s)]
*  No, no, probably, yes, pretty close to it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2598.3s)]
*  He comes out of far into the house. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2602.5s)]
*  There are two black leather recliners in front of this TV. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2603.9s)]
*  And he sits down and he's watching like CNN or whatever. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2609.7400000000002s)]
*  I sit in the next one, just sitting there [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2615.42s)]
*  and no one says anything. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2617.34s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, long as I'm alive. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2618.42s)]
*  I didn't know what to say to him, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2622.98s)]
*  because he didn't talk. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2624.1s)]
*  But now I know, know what I know, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2625.26s)]
*  he didn't talk to anybody. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2626.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2627.82s)]
*  And all of a sudden out of the blue, he goes, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2630.1s)]
*  you see these newsreels here, these things? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2632.38s)]
*  He said, that's a loop. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2636.66s)]
*  And he said, you know, I'm an addict. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2638.14s)]
*  I went, okay. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2640.26s)]
*  And he goes, I used to sit and watch TV for days [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2642.82s)]
*  until those loops would end. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2648.02s)]
*  And then he said it would start a whole other cycle [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2649.46s)]
*  of the news. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2652.5s)]
*  And he's explaining how TV works to me and that stuff. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2653.38s)]
*  And through the eyes of being high. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2656.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2659.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2660.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2661.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2662.02s)]
*  You know, and shortly after that, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2662.86s)]
*  it seemed like two days that we were sitting there. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2666.5800000000004s)]
*  It was probably a couple of hours. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2668.38s)]
*  And Janine and June come back. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2669.7000000000003s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2671.5800000000004s)]
*  They've been shopping at Stein Mart. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2672.5s)]
*  And. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2674.7000000000003s)]
*  I like Stein Mart actually. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2676.5s)]
*  Sometimes the sleeves are a little different. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2677.98s)]
*  Well, June took her there in her new blue Rolls Royce [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2679.7799999999997s)]
*  that John had just given her for her. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2682.42s)]
*  So there's a little, you know, yin yang there. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2684.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2686.42s)]
*  Janine was just pale white. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2687.2599999999998s)]
*  She knows no strangers. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2689.34s)]
*  So you never see Janine down. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2690.5s)]
*  So she kind of walked in, she was like, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2691.9s)]
*  she'd just been scared by a ghost. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2694.42s)]
*  And I kind of peeled away and met her in the back of the house. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2697.06s)]
*  I said, what happened? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2700.42s)]
*  She goes, I'll tell you later. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2701.2599999999998s)]
*  I can't talk about it. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2702.1s)]
*  Well, June had read her the write act [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2704.18s)]
*  on all this stuff I just told you about, you know, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2706.2999999999997s)]
*  they're not going to last, da da da da da da da da da. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2710.2599999999998s)]
*  And I said, can we go now? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2712.8999999999996s)]
*  She goes, no, we got one more day. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2714.06s)]
*  He goes, please. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2715.2999999999997s)]
*  Ah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2717.1s)]
*  One more day. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2718.8999999999996s)]
*  But no center did we get here. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2720.2999999999997s)]
*  And they were the most absolute supportive people [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2722.5s)]
*  in the world. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2725.9399999999996s)]
*  John came up one day. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2726.2999999999997s)]
*  We were getting ready to shoot the CD cover for Brandy Man, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2727.22s)]
*  the first CD. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2730.9399999999996s)]
*  And I said, he was always into everything. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2732.18s)]
*  He goes, what are you going to wear? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2735.1s)]
*  You know, how are you going to look? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2736.54s)]
*  How are you going to do your hair? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2737.2999999999997s)]
*  That kind of stuff, into image. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2738.54s)]
*  I said, well, I don't know. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2740.14s)]
*  I said, I've got a few things, ideas. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2741.2599999999998s)]
*  He goes, all right, I'll be back. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2744.2599999999998s)]
*  He said, left, getting his Mercedes. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2746.06s)]
*  He's shot out. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2747.7799999999997s)]
*  It's down the hill. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2748.7s)]
*  I need her to go to get up the mountain to it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2749.54s)]
*  He goes flying down the hill. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2752.7799999999997s)]
*  I guess he goes home, comes back in an hour or so, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2753.98s)]
*  opens the trunk of the car, reaches in, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2757.4199999999996s)]
*  and hands me this black suit. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2760.06s)]
*  And he goes, I had this back in 1972. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2762.42s)]
*  It was made by Manuel. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2765.46s)]
*  And he goes, I was sick back then, which meant he was sick. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2767.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2771.66s)]
*  So he was skinny enough for me to wear my skinny ass [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2772.46s)]
*  to get in that suit. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2775.86s)]
*  He goes, don't tell June. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2777.98s)]
*  She doesn't like me giving stuff away. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2779.78s)]
*  And I have it to this day. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2781.46s)]
*  I wore it on the back of that CD cover. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2782.38s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2784.22s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2786.06s)]
*  Oh, it was, hey, man. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2787.54s)]
*  Check the pockets, dude. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2789.18s)]
*  Let's party. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2790.22s)]
*  I bet that thing's got something. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2791.06s)]
*  She was something. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2792.14s)]
*  And the parties there, too, was strictly lemonade. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2792.98s)]
*  Lemonade and iced tea. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2795.46s)]
*  Really keeping it sober? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2796.94s)]
*  Keeping it completely sober on the table, for sure. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2798.42s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2802.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, and nothing in the back kitchen. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2803.18s)]
*  I mean, she was pretty strange about that. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2804.62s)]
*  She wore the pants in that deal, huh? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2807.02s)]
*  At that point. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2809.02s)]
*  Was she pretty much a, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2809.86s)]
*  because he probably needed somebody to really care for him. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2810.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2814.1s)]
*  As spies to that little story is that particular weekend [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2814.94s)]
*  when we were there, he was on furlough from rehab. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2819.7000000000003s)]
*  How long do you have to be, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2823.86s)]
*  I mean, you get furloughed. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2824.7000000000003s)]
*  I thought that was a military thing. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2825.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2826.58s)]
*  That's Johnny Cash, right? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2827.42s)]
*  Only Johnny Cash would have went to, right? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2828.42s)]
*  Only he would have went to boot camp for rehab. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2830.9s)]
*  And so all of a sudden at the end. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2834.46s)]
*  How many tours did he do? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2835.7400000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2837.1s)]
*  Oh, he did a lot. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2837.94s)]
*  But the day before he's supposed to go back, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2839.26s)]
*  this is a Saturday, he's going back on Sunday, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2841.54s)]
*  he comes down with the flu. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2843.58s)]
*  June's having no part of that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2845.7000000000003s)]
*  She's completely just, no, we're done. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2847.42s)]
*  So she wanted to talk to him [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2851.06s)]
*  and we're caught in the middle of that. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2852.94s)]
*  And I'm going, can we go home now? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2854.1400000000003s)]
*  Can we go home? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2856.1800000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, not yet. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2857.02s)]
*  Please go home. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2858.1400000000003s)]
*  June, June can tell the story better than I can. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2859.46s)]
*  But so June goes to Janiece, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2862.2200000000003s)]
*  he goes, y'all have to drive me to the hospital. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=2864.7000000000003s)]

*  Okay. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3619.04s)]
*  Yeah, they come from the north, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3619.88s)]
*  and they get cut off down in Missouri and whatever. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3621.08s)]
*  There's a lot of duck habitat on the way [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3623.32s)]
*  for them to stop and eat and whatever, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3625.32s)]
*  especially with climate change, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3627.56s)]
*  I won't get into all that. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3628.84s)]
*  But like Arkansas flooded timber, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3629.6800000000003s)]
*  a lot of those ducks come out of the rice fields and stuff, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3631.6400000000003s)]
*  and they're primarily greenheads, mallards. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3634.28s)]
*  But by the time you get to the marsh, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3637.04s)]
*  you got every kind, you know, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3639.0s)]
*  deep teal and mallards, and you could go on. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3640.4s)]
*  You have a fat stork up there even. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3642.76s)]
*  Oh, everything, everything. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3644.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like Africa, like going out into the marshes. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3645.96s)]
*  No, you're in that kind of environment. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3649.28s)]

*  And are you in a boat, or are you in? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3655.96s)]
*  You go out in a boat. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3658.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3659.16s)]
*  Everybody gets their own guide in their own boat. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3660.48s)]
*  And you have to hide underwater, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3662.04s)]
*  or you're above water? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3663.2s)]
*  Scooby tanks. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3664.64s)]

*  The blind about as big as your sofa. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3671.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's sunk in the water, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3673.3199999999997s)]
*  and then it's covered with, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3675.04s)]
*  and every guide has his own group of blinds [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3677.2799999999997s)]
*  you guys have to take care of. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3680.16s)]
*  A lot of straw and stuff, natural stuff. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3681.68s)]
*  Okay, so you're hiding in there? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3683.3199999999997s)]

*  you know, the guide will get out [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3693.96s)]

*  no snakes, snakes and gators. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3697.32s)]
*  They clean up all the appetizers. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3700.1600000000003s)]
*  Get all that out of there, exactly. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3701.48s)]
*  Then they'll take the boat back. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3703.36s)]
*  That way they start a duck hunt. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3704.2000000000003s)]
*  Come back, pull in the piro, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3705.2000000000003s)]

*  Ducks are good to eat too. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3713.08s)]
*  Turkeys, you know, people can say what they want. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3713.92s)]
*  You can fry anything or whatever, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3716.0400000000004s)]
*  but turkeys aren't that great to eat. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=3717.84s)]

*  But he could be funny. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4717.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he could be. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4718.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but he wasn't being funny on this one. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4719.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4723.28s)]
*  No, he came out and did the last five or six dates [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4725.5599999999995s)]
*  with us on our tour in 2010, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4728.24s)]
*  we were shutting things down. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4730.92s)]
*  It's one of those instances where you meet somebody famous [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4733.759999999999s)]
*  and the hag just shut me down. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4738.48s)]
*  I could not care on a conversation with him. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4739.92s)]
*  It's about as bad as Cash. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4742.96s)]
*  He didn't like chatting. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4745.88s)]
*  No, he didn't, but he liked you, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4747.799999999999s)]
*  and he let you know, where John didn't let you know [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4749.400000000001s)]
*  for a while, he just smoked you out [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4751.6s)]
*  just to see what you got. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4753.52s)]
*  Merle. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4756.4400000000005s)]
*  He could survive it. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4757.28s)]
*  Merle agreed to go on tour with us, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4758.2s)]
*  but we had to perform with him every night, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4761.28s)]
*  which of course was. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4763.64s)]
*  On stage together. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4764.76s)]
*  Yeah, throw us in the bar patch, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4765.76s)]
*  I mean, that was such a huge honor and whatever, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4767.8s)]
*  but he would come up with some obscure songs and whatever, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4770.64s)]
*  and I would jump. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4773.76s)]
*  It wasn't like Silver Wings or anything. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4775.32s)]
*  He's throwing his curve balls from way in the back. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4777.36s)]
*  Okay, tonight. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4780.48s)]
*  Was out there singing Pit Bull or something? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4782.44s)]
*  Diving in person. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4784.08s)]
*  And I hopped up on his bus one afternoon [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4785.24s)]
*  to find out what our song was. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4788.24s)]
*  We were in Woodstock, New York, I remember, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4790.36s)]
*  and he's up there burning one down, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4792.16s)]
*  and he goes, you need to sit down. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4794.0s)]
*  I go, okay. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4796.84s)]
*  What is it? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4799.8s)]
*  Merle goes, what the hell's wrong with y'all? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4800.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know, Merle, what's wrong with this? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4805.4s)]
*  I got that damn window. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4807.84s)]
*  All them people out there. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4809.52s)]
*  What the hell's wrong with y'all? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4812.56s)]
*  I don't know, Merle, what's wrong with this? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4815.56s)]
*  All them damn people out there, y'all wanna quit. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4819.64s)]
*  Merle. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4825.84s)]
*  It's a good point. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4826.68s)]
*  I said. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4827.52s)]
*  Looking back, it was ingenious. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4828.36s)]
*  Our last tour we thought. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4831.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4833.04s)]
*  So Merle, I gotta tell you, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4834.68s)]
*  Poncho on Lefty's probably one of my favorite songs ever. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4837.12s)]
*  I said, watching you and Willie in that video, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4840.0s)]
*  I said, it's one of the coolest things [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4843.200000000001s)]
*  I've ever seen you do. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4844.56s)]
*  Y'all are like best friends. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4846.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, Ronnie Dunn and I didn't even know each other [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4848.8s)]
*  when we met. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4852.68s)]
*  We've bullied our way through this freaking career [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4853.72s)]
*  for 20 years. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4856.88s)]
*  We have not taken a break. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4857.76s)]
*  And we've just gotten to a point [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4860.160000000001s)]
*  where we think it'd be the best thing for us. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4861.4800000000005s)]
*  We've made it 20 years. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4864.92s)]
*  You and Willie Nelson made one album together. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4865.92s)]
*  And he goes. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4871.2s)]
*  Yeah, but we only had one hit. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4873.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, Merle, what's my song? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4877.4s)]
*  He started laughing. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4879.719999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you win. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4880.84s)]
*  You're smarter than me. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4882.32s)]
*  You always will be. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4883.32s)]
*  It is crazy to think that when you almost say that [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4884.92s)]
*  to some people, even me hearing it from you guys, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4887.16s)]
*  like, yeah, this is gonna be it. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4889.44s)]
*  Because it's, but that's just, it is what it is. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4891.92s)]
*  It's like your life's at where it's at, you know? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4895.76s)]
*  When you've taken breaks, what are other things [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4899.08s)]
*  that you've started to fill your lives with [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4900.92s)]
*  that became like important to you [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4902.64s)]
*  or that meant something to you? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4904.08s)]
*  I know you have your vineyards. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4906.6s)]
*  Yeah, my friend Chris used to work out of there. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4908.76s)]
*  Yeah, but that was, I started that 20 years ago. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4910.56s)]
*  And other things, really what I really wanted to do, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4914.32s)]
*  and I'd been offered a couple of bit parts [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4917.4400000000005s)]
*  in movies and stuff along the way. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4919.36s)]
*  Making a movie takes a long scheduling and all that. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4922.16s)]
*  And we really, we did tour 20 years without stopping. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4924.5199999999995s)]
*  And I kind of did some theater in college. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4927.639999999999s)]
*  I went to Louisiana Tech, you know? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4929.72s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, dude. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4931.28s)]
*  Yeah, and enjoyed all that. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4932.5599999999995s)]
*  With the Red Fern Grows, they used to do [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4933.84s)]
*  that musical up there. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4935.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4936.36s)]
*  A lot of good. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4937.2s)]
*  A lot of beautiful. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4938.04s)]
*  All right, Covington, don't get me started now. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4941.12s)]
*  Talk amongst yourselves. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4943.679999999999s)]
*  This is a war you don't wanna start. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4944.8s)]
*  Hey, look, Ronald Reagan. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4946.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, it is, it is, dude. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4948.72s)]
*  The Rust and verse Covington, that'd be a great battle. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4950.72s)]
*  Bring that horror back. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4953.72s)]
*  You can keep Terry Bradshaw. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4955.72s)]
*  Oh, that's so good. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4957.72s)]
*  It'll be okay. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4959.72s)]
*  Oh, that's so good. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4960.72s)]
*  Anyway, but I got in, told to call William Morris, you know, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4962.72s)]
*  and said, he looks at us and said, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4966.72s)]
*  hey, I don't wanna start a movie. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4968.72s)]
*  I'm not qualified or, you know, don't have the chops. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4970.72s)]
*  But I would, I would, I would, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4974.72s)]
*  I would if there's a bit part or something that maybe [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4978.72s)]
*  some, some whatever, if something comes up, you know? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4980.72s)]
*  And so, yeah, they started sending me some things [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4984.72s)]
*  and I actually started doing some movies, this and that. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4987.72s)]
*  And my son had studied film at Vanderbilt in English [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4990.72s)]
*  and wanted to be a screenwriter. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4994.72s)]
*  And one thing led to another, he came out [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4996.72s)]
*  and started writing with some guys that had produced, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=4998.72s)]
*  I co-starred with Ernie Hudson eventually in a Western. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5001.72s)]
*  Oh, sweet, I'm not familiar with Ernie Hudson. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5004.72s)]

*  So I'm scared about it, but I think it's going to happen. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5087.72s)]
*  We worked on it for so long and now it's supposed to happen. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5093.72s)]

*  That's normal. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5099.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5100.72s)]

*  He says, I go up second floor, right? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5143.72s)]
*  So I knock on the door and he says, you know, it kind of cracks open. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5146.72s)]

*  Are you kidding me? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5293.72s)]
*  Have you been? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5294.72s)]
*  Dude, yes. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5295.72s)]
*  Went just recently and actually played down there. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5296.72s)]
*  You know about the Rodeo. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5299.72s)]
*  Yes, I know about it, dude. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5300.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5302.72s)]
*  Eight seconds for freedom, they call it. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5303.72s)]
*  For freedom. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5305.72s)]
*  But it's six seconds. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5306.72s)]
*  You know, the first event is called Busting Out. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5307.72s)]
*  So, yeah, these I've got a friend, Brianna Calhoun, who she does prison reentry. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5310.72s)]
*  We stayed at the warden's house. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5317.72s)]
*  No, I want to be the warden. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5319.72s)]
*  Oh, dude, he's fantastic. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5320.72s)]

*  Yeah, we stayed up making gumbo and drinking beer about one o'clock in the morning. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5324.72s)]
*  But the Rodeo, the first event Busting Out, they put six prisoners on six bulls and they're [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5329.72s)]
*  PBR bulls. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5334.72s)]
*  They're real bulls because they do a PBR exhibit kind of thing there. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5335.72s)]
*  They put six guys on it. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5339.72s)]
*  They release all six of them at the same time. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5340.72s)]
*  Of course, the prisoners stay on for like a tenth of a second and then it's all hell [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5343.72s)]
*  breaks loose. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5347.72s)]
*  And every event at the Rodeo is like that. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5348.72s)]
*  There's one called Pinball where they set up eight hula hoops in the middle of the deal. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5350.72s)]
*  Eight prisoners stand in the hula hoops. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5355.72s)]
*  They release two bulls on them and the last one in the hula hoop wins the prize. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5356.72s)]
*  No, it's fantastic. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5360.72s)]
*  You got nothing to lose. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5361.72s)]
*  You got to go. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5362.72s)]
*  The prize is just a little bit of sunlight. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5363.72s)]
*  Right? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5366.72s)]

*  You get to use a harmonica for 10 minutes. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5371.72s)]
*  Big time bragging rights. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5374.72s)]
*  You get a ball to bounce. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5376.72s)]
*  There were 96 volunteers this year and it happens twice a year. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5377.72s)]
*  You should really go. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5381.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable to watch. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5382.72s)]

*  We got to go on this. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5397.72s)]
*  Bro, it'd be fascinating. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5398.72s)]
*  Bull, this is the place where even the bulls are afraid to come out at you. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5399.72s)]
*  They're going out there. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5404.72s)]
*  There it is. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5405.72s)]

*  I'd love to interview the warden because it's a fascinating thing. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5412.72s)]
*  There's not another prison, I don't think, that does something as famous as this. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5413.72s)]

*  This is a secretariat semen or whatever. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5536.76s)]

*  Songs you get with musicians and they don't talk. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5758.76s)]
*  They don't. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5761.76s)]
*  They're musicians. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5762.76s)]
*  I remember Tom Petty with the talk show and not talk. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5763.76s)]
*  Freaking musicians. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5766.76s)]
*  There's a reason why they handed him an instrument. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5769.76s)]
*  The last guy you wanted to do was have Tom Petty come sit by you and do an interview with him. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5771.76s)]
*  I guess. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5775.76s)]

*  It's all right. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5779.76s)]
*  Bill Vassar told me I was interviewing him, you know, doing the Countdown show. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5780.76s)]
*  I said, so how did you get to be such a good piano player? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5785.68s)]
*  He goes, well, actually, I was a drummer when I was a kid. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5788.68s)]
*  And I said, oh, really? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5790.68s)]
*  I said, I've never heard you play drums. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5791.68s)]
*  I was a kid, man. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5793.68s)]
*  All I wanted was a drum set. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5794.68s)]
*  Christmas, I get a drum set. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5795.68s)]
*  He goes, I just beat on those drums relentlessly day and night, whatever. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5796.68s)]
*  He goes, I got good at it. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5799.68s)]
*  I go, what happened? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5802.68s)]
*  He goes, I came home from school one day and my drums were gone. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5803.68s)]

*  He goes, rode my bicycle. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5810.68s)]
*  I got real good at it. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5811.68s)]
*  That guy believes in himself too much. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5815.6s)]
*  His drums are gone. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ehBCkF7V4&t=5817.6s)]
