# Brotherly Love  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #384
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA)
*  Happy St. Patrick's, how about it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy St. Patrick's, baby, you can... [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3.0s)]
*  You know, it's a... [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=6.0s)]
*  If you celebrate St. Patrick's, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=8.0s)]
*  I want to wish you well with it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=11.0s)]
*  If you've ever found yourself in a shiny green hat, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=14.0s)]
*  vomiting outside of a 7-Eleven, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=18.0s)]
*  then you are probably Irish. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=23.0s)]
*  If you've ever... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=29.0s)]
*  If you hit about the age of 50 and you have the same haircut as your wife, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=32.0s)]
*  that's an Irish staple, I feel like. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=37.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=44.0s)]
*  Oh, a lot of Irish men and women, as they age, they got the same tits on them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=45.0s)]
*  Do you notice that? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=50.0s)]
*  They similarly jugged up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=53.0s)]
*  You know, you see them, they... [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=57.0s)]
*  That's a popular Irish thing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=60.0s)]
*  You hit 50, 55, you and your wife, who's almost your buddy now, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=62.0s)]
*  you know, they just... [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=69.0s)]
*  They kind of morph into the same being, it seems like, or twins almost. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=70.0s)]
*  And they double-titted, they got the same tits. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=75.0s)]
*  But happy St. Patrick's Day to you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=78.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=82.0s)]
*  A lot of closeted gay happens during St. Pat's, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=83.0s)]
*  because men, they get the tits, it's a lot of liquor, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=88.0s)]
*  they're carrying around the... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=92.0s)]
*  In New Orleans, at the St. Patrick's Day parade, they'll carry this thing of flowers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=95.0s)]
*  And then the men get drunker and they start kissing each other on the face, even at some point. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=101.0s)]
*  And I don't know, at that point... [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=106.0s)]
*  That's when I would usually drive home, but some men keep going and the parade keeps going and... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=109.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened, I just... [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=115.0s)]
*  You know, you just hope for the best for those guys. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=119.0s)]
*  You know, you hope somebody gets them a sandwich or kind of helps them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=123.0s)]
*  Because you'll end up damn gay and not even want to be, you know... [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=127.0s)]
*  And it wasn't a plan when you started out in the morning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=130.0s)]
*  And that is St. Patrick's Day, a lot. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=134.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=138.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=141.0s)]
*  So the other day, I'm ordering... [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=142.0s)]
*  I guess what I want to talk about is autism. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=147.0s)]
*  You know, I'm ordering some cottage cheese at a breakfast place, I'm ordering some cottage cheese. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=152.0s)]
*  And it's a rare choice, it is what it is, I ordered it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=158.0s)]
*  The guy goes, I don't know if we have cottage cheese, but let me see what I can do for you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=164.0s)]
*  That's nice, that's a sweet guy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=172.0s)]
*  So I wait, he brings over a bowl, he brings over a bowl... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=175.0s)]
*  And it's like three or four pieces of cheese cut up in a little bitty squares and shapes, kind of just... [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=180.0s)]
*  And he just kind of stacked them all in a little bowl. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=189.0s)]
*  And I just, I mean, the shit just... [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=197.0s)]
*  I'm grateful, you know, I didn't want... [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=200.0s)]
*  That's not how I... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=202.0s)]
*  I didn't want things like that, but the guy made an effort. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=203.0s)]
*  But I think what we're starting to see more and more is autism. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=207.0s)]
*  You know, we're starting to see it more as a... [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=213.0s)]
*  It's a positive in this, because here's what it is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=217.0s)]
*  A lot of big business owners now, you know, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, they have autism. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=222.0s)]
*  You know, nobody wants to flat out say it, but if you're part computer, part person, that's always what autism was. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=233.0s)]
*  Autism was that, you know, was Danny Calculator. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=239.0s)]
*  It was that dude who you would start talking, you would reach out to shake his hand, and he would kind of shake... [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=243.0s)]
*  He would shake your hand with his eyes, you know? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=248.0s)]
*  He would like kind of just look at you, look down, look up, look down, look up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=250.0s)]
*  Like he was... [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=256.0s)]
*  You know, he's part computer. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=257.0s)]
*  It's built into him. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=258.0s)]
*  And those are people that are starting to rule the world, because the world is becoming more man and more computer. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=261.0s)]
*  It's... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=269.0s)]
*  You know, we're merging. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=270.0s)]
*  It's that man... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=271.0s)]
*  You know, it's that man pewter, you know? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=272.0s)]
*  That compumen, you know? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=275.0s)]
*  It's that... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=277.0s)]
*  It's that middle ground. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=279.0s)]
*  You'll put a... [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=282.0s)]
*  You'll put your hand in a woman's pants and she'll have a damn, you know, quarter of a keyboard down there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=284.0s)]
*  You know, and you'll just start typing in, you know, CLIT or, you know, Labia or whatever. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=292.0s)]
*  However you spell it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=298.0s)]
*  You know, you don't even... [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=299.0s)]
*  You're not even really touching the genitals anymore. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=300.0s)]
*  You're just typing in the words of it, you know? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=303.0s)]
*  Uh, uh, uh. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=306.0s)]
*  You're just UH, UH, UH, UH, UH, until they, you know... [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=307.0s)]
*  I'm just saying we're starting to... [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=312.0s)]
*  We're seeing the merging of people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=314.0s)]
*  And that's what, you know, it's just... [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=319.0s)]
*  And those are people that are going to rule the world, because it's... [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=320.0s)]
*  It's just we're becoming more of both. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=324.0s)]
*  We're becoming more computerized, automated, ATM, blender. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=329.0s)]
*  You know, you just... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=337.0s)]
*  So just being a human is not... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=339.0s)]
*  It's good, but it's old fashioned. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=343.0s)]
*  These people that are doing it all now are people that can see both worlds at once. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=347.0s)]
*  And sometimes you get the Jeff Bezos. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=354.0s)]
*  Sometimes you get the, um... [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=356.0s)]
*  Sometimes you get the Elon Musk. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=359.0s)]
*  And sometimes, uh, you get Patrick. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=364.0s)]
*  You get the dude who brought me, who cut up four pieces of cheese into a bowl. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=367.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind... [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=373.0s)]
*  It's a light autism. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=374.0s)]
*  It's not helping anybody really, but... [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=376.0s)]
*  You know, it helps... [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=378.0s)]
*  You know, it's... [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=379.0s)]
*  It works at a diner a little bit, I guess. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=382.0s)]
*  Anyway, um... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=387.0s)]
*  I don't know exactly what I'm talking about, but I never have. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=390.0s)]
*  And I'm grateful to be here with you today. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=392.0s)]
*  And I mean that from all of my a orders. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=396.0s)]
*  Let's hear a little bit of this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=400.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=408.0s)]
*  We're gonna take it back, baby. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=411.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=418.0s)]
*  Come on, baby. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=439.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=441.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=464.0s)]
*  A little time [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=468.0s)]
*  For me to set that parking brake [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=472.0s)]
*  And let myself unwind [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=474.0s)]
*  Shine that light on me [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=477.0s)]
*  I'll slip and tell you my story [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=483.0s)]
*  Shine on me [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=488.0s)]
*  And now we find the song [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=493.0s)]
*  We'll sing it just for you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=496.0s)]
*  Oh, there we are. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=502.0s)]
*  That's Shine by Bishop Gunn. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=504.0s)]
*  You know that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=505.0s)]
*  And that's that old hitter. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=506.0s)]
*  And that's the... [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=509.0s)]
*  That's the one that started it all for us. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=511.0s)]
*  And here we are 384... 383 episodes later. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=513.0s)]
*  Gang, baby. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=520.0s)]
*  Good to be with you today. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=521.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=524.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=525.0s)]
*  Not much, man. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=526.0s)]
*  Not much. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=528.0s)]
*  Really just kind of checking in with myself, you know. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=529.0s)]
*  You know, just sometimes I like to ask myself, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=533.0s)]
*  Well, how are you feeling, man? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=534.0s)]
*  You know I do. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=536.0s)]
*  You know, I'm that feel... [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=538.0s)]
*  You know, I'm that... [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=539.0s)]
*  That feeling ferret, baby. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=542.0s)]
*  I'll scurry all across my damn... [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=544.0s)]
*  You know, I'll just... [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=548.0s)]
*  You know, I really... [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=551.0s)]
*  I'm right there on my feelings. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=552.0s)]
*  If you need my feelings, I got them inches for you, baby. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=554.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like to ask myself, What's going on? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=560.0s)]
*  What am I feeling? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=563.0s)]
*  What am I thinking? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=564.0s)]
*  What's got me excited? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=566.0s)]
*  What's got me scared? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=568.0s)]
*  You know, where's my head at? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=570.0s)]
*  Where should my head be at? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=574.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=577.0s)]
*  But I like to ask myself those things. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=581.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=582.0s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=583.0s)]
*  And then answer myself. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=586.0s)]
*  Well... [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=587.0s)]
*  Sometimes I don't want to answer myself when I'm feeling good. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=589.0s)]
*  Sometimes I'll get into that little spin cycle of... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=594.0s)]
*  I just want to be feeling bad, you know, that permanent pressure. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=599.0s)]
*  But sometimes it's like, Hey... [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=606.0s)]
*  I'm all right. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=609.0s)]
*  I'm all right, baby. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=611.0s)]

*  I'm doing good. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=636.0s)]
*  We're merging, I wonder. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=639.0s)]
*  Are we becoming more robots? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=640.0s)]

*  That have, you know... [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=646.0s)]
*  Half a calculator behind their eyes and... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=648.0s)]
*  And they're more operating system than they are heart. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=652.0s)]
*  And you want... [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=660.0s)]
*  You're like, you know, you start to wonder, are they the next evolution? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=661.0s)]
*  Am I just out here living in the Stone Age with my feelings? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=668.0s)]
*  When three generations from now, it'll be... [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=674.0s)]
*  You know, it'll all, you know... [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=679.0s)]
*  They'll have our feelings almost... [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=682.0s)]
*  Well, we've been taken over by some type of... [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=685.0s)]
*  Or cross-bred with a gigabyte and... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=689.0s)]
*  And... [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=694.0s)]
*  And you'll press a button on your hip and you'll smile. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=696.0s)]
*  You know, I just... [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=698.0s)]
*  I don't know what the future's gonna be like. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=699.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=701.0s)]
*  But I believe that autism is that gray area where we're starting to see maybe... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=703.0s)]
*  Because it used to be somebody had autism, like, damn, Ricky's fucked up. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=708.0s)]

*  I'm looking forward to that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=884.0s)]
*  You know, I've wanted a piano for a long time, so I'm gonna have that bitch. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=886.0s)]

*  Yeah, I got up this morning and I went over to the gym, you know. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=898.0s)]
*  I get up and do a routine right now. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=902.0s)]
*  I get up and I make a... [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=905.0s)]
*  I do prayers and then I do a gratitude list and a meditation. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=909.0s)]
*  And then I get into motion. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=916.0s)]
*  I get moving, baby. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=919.0s)]
*  I get, you know... [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=920.0s)]
*  Weener first is kind of my motto. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=922.0s)]
*  It's like, sometimes you can walk where your body, your shoulders are first or your face is first. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=924.0s)]
*  We used to have this one fella, he always kind of looked like this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=930.0s)]
*  Like his nose was always first. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=933.0s)]
*  Looked like he was always smelling booty, you know, body gas or something. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=936.0s)]
*  Or sniffing, you know, that butt hash. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=942.0s)]
*  You know, if somebody had been, you know, chiefin' out their own butt doing gas, body gassing, fartin'. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=944.0s)]
*  You know, fartin'. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=952.0s)]
*  If somebody had been doing any of that, he... [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=954.0s)]
*  You'd... [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=958.0s)]
*  He walked like he had nose first, you know, this fella Stephen. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=959.0s)]
*  Like he was always... like he was a detective for body gas, poop gas, butt, butt hash. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=963.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about, gas, fartin'. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=970.0s)]
*  And so some people walk like that, nose first. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=977.0s)]
*  Some people walk knees first, a lot of Indian people. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=980.0s)]
*  If you have a friend who is a far eastern Indian, not Native Americans, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=983.0s)]
*  who are pretty much my new favorite people too, I want to say that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=991.0s)]
*  So... [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=995.0s)]
*  But anyway, if you are an Indian, you know, like... [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=998.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about, an Indian dude. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1002.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about, an Indian dude. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1004.0s)]
*  Trucker or gas station guy, IT guy, engineer. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1006.0s)]
*  Sometimes they almost look like black guys, but they're not. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1015.0s)]
*  You ever see a black dude, but he has regular hair? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1018.0s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1021.0s)]
*  That's an Indian dude, or Bangladeshi. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1022.0s)]
*  And they won't tell you if they're one or the other, you gotta ask them. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1025.0s)]
*  You almost have to tap on them and ask them. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1028.0s)]
*  And Indian people, they walk sometimes knees first. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1030.0s)]
*  It's hard, it's very... [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1034.0s)]
*  They will do it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1038.0s)]
*  But my new thing, wiener first. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1040.0s)]
*  If you got that wiener, if you are leading with that vestibule of seed, baby, that wiener, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1041.0s)]
*  then you're telling the world, hey, get this, that, you know? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1050.0s)]
*  That's what you're telling the world. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1056.0s)]
*  And that's why you're saying, hey, you're gonna come at me? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1057.0s)]
*  I'm gonna give you this serving right up. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1060.0s)]
*  And there's something powerful about that, to walk with your loin, with that bag, baby. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1063.0s)]
*  You know, with that bag and branch, baby, with that bat, with that bat and satchel, baby. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1071.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1076.0s)]
*  With that root and them seed buckets, baby. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1077.0s)]

*  They have... [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1299.0s)]
*  I remember seeing... [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1300.0s)]
*  Not seeing, but hearing descriptive stories of children playing with stone dolls over there. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1302.0s)]
*  And you'd see a drawing of like a five-year-old girl carrying a, you know, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1310.0s)]
*  four-pound stone doll that she got for Christmas or whatever. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1314.0s)]
*  So, when your first baby doll, that baby weighs four pounds, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1321.0s)]
*  and it's made out of stone, and you gotta keep it in your bed at night, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1329.0s)]
*  or even if you put it in the garden, and a bird shits on that thing, baby. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1333.0s)]
*  That's a... [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1336.0s)]
*  And you still carrying that thing to church? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1337.0s)]
*  I mean, you are a lot of tough people over there. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1339.0s)]
*  And yeah, you know, I think it's a... [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1345.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of a travesty to see that there's so much violence. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1348.0s)]
*  But yeah, they want to Eastwood it out. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1353.0s)]
*  They want to bang it out. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1355.0s)]
*  That dude's saying, mail me a bullet. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1356.0s)]
*  You can put a bullet in the mail of that dude. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1358.0s)]
*  He's ready to use it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1360.0s)]
*  And you know, I don't know enough about the situation, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1364.0s)]
*  but I just know that we're going to try to help where we can. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1369.0s)]
*  And actually, right now, we're running a 25% off sale on the Out of Gas collection [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1371.0s)]
*  from now until this Sunday, March 2nd. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1377.0s)]
*  And proceeds from the sale will go to the World Vision International Ukraine Crisis Fund. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1380.0s)]
*  I have a friend that works for that organization. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1387.0s)]
*  They're a great organization. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1390.0s)]
*  They really focus on helping children. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1392.0s)]
*  And they have this Ukraine specific crisis fund. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1396.0s)]
*  So that's where it's going to go to. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1399.0s)]
*  If you don't like that charity, that's totally fine. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1400.0s)]
*  Put your efforts somewhere else. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1402.0s)]

*  Well, that's what we're going to do, man. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1412.0s)]
*  You know, and yeah, it's just, I mean, war is just damn. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1414.0s)]

*  You know, you see people, they want it all. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1424.0s)]
*  And I think Putin, he wants to go out, he wants to go out that banger. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1426.0s)]
*  You know, he's kind of that fifth year senior right now. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1432.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm not going out without using all the toys. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1435.0s)]
*  I'm not going out without using all the toys. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1440.0s)]
*  He's that toy bear, you know, and he opens up his toy chest and it's all missiles, baby. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1443.0s)]

*  He's got a knife that have a damn missile in it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1453.0s)]
*  You stab somebody and then a missile shoots him like, damn, just stabbed him. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1456.0s)]
*  But that's who he is, baby. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1462.0s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1464.0s)]
*  And he is who you thought he was. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1465.0s)]
*  You always knew it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1467.0s)]
*  The dude shirtless, he's out there fucking, you know, he's, you know, he's, he don't have a lot of heart. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1468.0s)]
*  And he's from another era. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1478.0s)]
*  But Ukraine's saying, let's bang, baby. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1482.0s)]
*  Let's make it three out of five. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1485.0s)]
*  You know, Herb Dean's trying to step in and they're saying, no, no, no, no, let it go. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1487.0s)]
*  Let it go. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1491.0s)]
*  Let it go. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1493.0s)]
*  I'd love to see Bisping and Anik commentate it because I wouldn't be surprised to see Ukraine make that comeback. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1494.0s)]
*  And, you know, and our thoughts and well wishes and prayers with everybody over there. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1501.0s)]
*  It's a lot of travesty going on when you see war happen. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1508.0s)]
*  And in a second, we're going to take those calls. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1512.0s)]
*  We had a lot of people calling about the masturbation. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1514.0s)]
*  And if they had ever had a sibling, if they caught a sibling masturbating, how that had fared and what that's like to grow up being a victim of visual sibling masturbation. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1516.0s)]
*  Seeing victim. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1534.0s)]
*  So all right, I want to know what would you do if you didn't have any high interest loans? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1537.0s)]
*  High interest loans. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1543.0s)]
*  And it's a good question because some people don't know. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1544.0s)]
*  Some people, they might make themselves a steak dinner or get get a steak for the kid. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1548.0s)]
*  A kid had never had a steak. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1553.0s)]
*  I remember I had my first steak when I think I was 16, 17. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1556.0s)]
*  Somebody, daddy, cut me a piece of steak or left some on his plate because he got drunk. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1560.0s)]

*  They're hilarious. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1831.0s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you if you don't mind blowing up the spot. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1832.0s)]
*  What's the name of the ayahuasca retreat that you went to in L.A.? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1837.0s)]
*  I've been I've been feeling the need to go and get that done. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1843.0s)]
*  Gang, baby, I appreciate you asking. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1847.0s)]
*  And it's a secretive place. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1849.0s)]
*  That's the that's the thing right now. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1850.0s)]
*  You know, it can't be legally done in America. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1852.0s)]
*  I believe unless you're a church. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1855.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1863.0s)]
*  It says right here the ayahuasca plant itself is not illegal in the United States. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1864.0s)]
*  However, the active ingredient DMT is as it is classified as a schedule one drug, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1869.0s)]
*  which is the same category as hair on an ecstasy. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1875.0s)]
*  Man, I can tell you these things are way ayahuasca is way different than that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1878.0s)]
*  Ayahuasca has been decriminalized in Oakland, California, Santa Cruz, Denver, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1884.0s)]
*  Colorado, Washington, D.C. and Cambridge, Massachusetts. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1892.0s)]
*  This means you won't face prosecution if you possess or use a psychedelic brew, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1896.0s)]
*  but only in these cities. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1901.0s)]
*  And I don't know how much of that is true. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1905.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's really the best information. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1907.0s)]
*  This is just off a random space on the Internet. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1909.0s)]
*  Let me read one more. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1913.0s)]
*  While it is true that only the two main Brazilian ayahuasca religions, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1923.0s)]
*  Unayo do Vegetal and Santo Daime have secured legal protections for sacramental ayahuasca use in the U.S. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1929.0s)]
*  And those legal protections do not yet formally extend to anyone else. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1939.0s)]
*  Today, there is a growing movement of churches asserting their rights, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1944.0s)]
*  either by formal petitions or heel digging perseverance, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1948.0s)]
*  to use psychedelic sacraments as part of the free exercise of their religions under the First Amendment of the U.S. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1952.0s)]
*  Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1958.0s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1962.0s)]
*  This article is also from 2020, so that doesn't really help us. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1966.0s)]
*  Let me see if I can get anything more recent. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1972.0s)]
*  Seattle's psychedelic revolution has arrived. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1976.0s)]
*  Decriminalization means shrooms have officially taken root. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1980.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1984.0s)]
*  You know, I'm going to have to do a little bit more investigative on this. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1988.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to do a little bit more investigative. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1994.0s)]
*  From what I believe and have heard, you have to be a church to administer the drug. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=1996.0s)]
*  You have to be a church. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2004.0s)]
*  I know there's a lot of groups that are fighting and pushing for it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2006.0s)]
*  The group that I did it with is fighting and pushing for it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2008.0s)]
*  But in the meantime, it's got a trap house vibe to it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2014.0s)]
*  And it's really fascinating. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2018.0s)]
*  You go and you wear all white and you sit there and you are in this group. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2022.0s)]
*  And I didn't know anybody when I went. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2028.0s)]
*  And you drink one plant and then a little while later you drink another plant. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2030.0s)]
*  And you sit there and you just start meditating. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2036.0s)]
*  You just start having a thought and then it becomes a story. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2040.0s)]
*  And then the story, you start to realize that it's not just a thought you're having. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2046.0s)]
*  It's a... sometimes kind of a realization. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2054.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2060.0s)]
*  I'll go more into it. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2062.0s)]
*  I'm going to think more about it. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2064.0s)]
*  If you have any questions about the Ayahuasca Send-In or about my experience, send them in. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2066.0s)]
*  And I'll try to do an episode about it, specifically about it next time. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2070.0s)]
*  I know last time we put this question on, it was a very interesting question as to the time in men's lives. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2074.0s)]
*  About their body and their semen. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2082.0s)]
*  And I want to just hear that question right now. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2088.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2090.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's probably... [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2092.0s)]
*  If there's anybody out there, if you ever had a brother, you've accidentally seen your brother masturbate or something. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2094.0s)]
*  You know, and I'm not trying to be, you know, nasty or whatever. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2098.0s)]
*  But I'm just curious the effect it has on you. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2104.0s)]
*  Can you still look at him the same as everything's still okay between you? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2106.0s)]
*  And if you saw him, do you tell him? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2112.0s)]
*  Do you let him know that? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2114.0s)]
*  Or is that a private thing? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2116.0s)]
*  Or if your brother saw you, how did you handle that? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2118.0s)]
*  You know, how did you handle that? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2122.0s)]
*  And we had a lot of interesting calls, man. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2124.0s)]
*  And I find this stuff to be fascinating. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2128.0s)]
*  And some people will say this stuff's homoerotic. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2130.0s)]
*  I don't find that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2136.0s)]
*  But I find it interesting to get a bead on how we learn sex. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2138.0s)]
*  And what it means and how we... [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2146.0s)]
*  You know, I've had taboos at things in my life where I was like, oh, I can't talk about this. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2148.0s)]
*  I can't share this. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2152.0s)]
*  I can't say things that I'm into or not into. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2154.0s)]
*  I'm afraid. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2156.0s)]

*  judging here. But I just you know, I just Well, here's what I [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2834.1600000000003s)]
*  would do. I think you should at one make make some joy out of [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2838.88s)]

*  get a nine, you get a six. If your sister gives you a 10, dude, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=2860.0s)]

*  otherwise, who teaches you, you know, some creep over there, some [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3026.6s)]

*  May maybe it's the brother's responsibility. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3058.04s)]
*  Or the father's responsibility. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3062.6s)]
*  That's a great I wonder how they used to do it in native [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3067.24s)]
*  culture. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3070.08s)]

*  we allow everything to be made taboo and then we [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3084.6s)]
*  and then it's profited off of products are created. It's like [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3091.36s)]
*  if my brother taught me how to masturbate, I I use the same [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3095.68s)]
*  style as him. You know, it's like people would know is by our [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3100.52s)]
*  style. If you know, say a cop saw somebody jerking off near a [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3103.3999999999996s)]

*  sad that I'd asked him. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3185.48s)]

*  just had decided he couldn't drive anymore. And I'm just [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3191.28s)]

*  been single for quite some time now. I haven't been having sex [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3864.8799999999997s)]

*  Gang, baby, you trying to get that hitter, baby? And I feel [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3891.4799999999996s)]
*  you look, first of all, you got to get a woman or something [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3895.2799999999997s)]
*  that has, you know, something that's willing to let you get [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3898.12s)]
*  inside it. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3904.8799999999997s)]
*  And legally, I think it has to be a woman or man. But I would, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3908.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, I don't know where you reside on the sexual spectrum. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3912.9599999999996s)]
*  But [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3917.76s)]
*  it has to be one of them. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3921.36s)]
*  So [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3924.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know how to get back out there. Are you dating? Did you [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3927.12s)]
*  give me any more information? Let me listen one more time. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3929.56s)]
*  I've got stuff off my chest. You know, I've been single for quite [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3932.6800000000003s)]
*  some time now. I haven't been having sex in the last, I don't [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3935.48s)]
*  know, two years. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3940.32s)]
*  Okay, now that's a long time and there's a lot of asexuality [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3942.0s)]
*  going on. So, you know, but sometimes you go through patches [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3944.72s)]
*  and you don't need to feel like you have to have sex all the [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3948.32s)]
*  time. That's something that's crazy. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3950.88s)]
*  You know, that's a crazy thing. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3953.84s)]
*  Because once you start that fuse inside of yourself, like I gotta [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3957.36s)]
*  have I gotta get I gotta meet girl, girl, girl, dude, that [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3959.92s)]
*  shit got lit in me years ago. And that thing is a nightmare. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3962.64s)]
*  And mine's finally starting to quell a little. So I don't feel [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3966.32s)]
*  that constant need like I need a boyfriend. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3970.8s)]
*  I don't need like I need approval. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3973.28s)]
*  Because that fuse will get lit and it will just keep going. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3979.36s)]
*  And it's not even you. You're just acting on this impulse. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3982.1600000000003s)]
*  So first of all, you're coming from a great place of peace. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3986.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm choosing. I would like to get that damp baby that labia. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3990.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, bro? That little smut mitten dog. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3995.2000000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, bro? That's not holster. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=3998.88s)]
*  So. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4002.0s)]
*  I think you got a great shot, dude. I don't know how to just [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4005.04s)]
*  get back in just to sex. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4008.32s)]
*  I think it's kind of easy. People are doing sex all the time. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4010.96s)]
*  Even though I read an article that animals aren't even having [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4015.84s)]
*  sex anymore. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4018.32s)]
*  So that's I don't know what that's going to be like in the [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4020.32s)]
*  future. You know, you go to pet stores and there's just videos [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4022.48s)]
*  and shit and just reenactments in there of just our little [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4026.32s)]
*  stuffed animals. I have no, you know. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4030.1600000000003s)]
*  A lot of scary stuff going on. But if you have any suggestions [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4033.1200000000003s)]
*  for Tyrell, how to just get sex. I mean, go get you a little [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4035.6s)]
*  hooker also if you want that. I guess I don't know enough to [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4038.96s)]
*  know what you want. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4042.48s)]
*  But if you just want to get the Willy wet. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4046.0s)]
*  Then you I think you could, you know. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4049.6800000000003s)]
*  You could go to another country and get you a little hooker. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4053.28s)]
*  Oh, you know that titty for hire, baby. You could do it or [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4056.7200000000003s)]
*  talk to somebody. There's a lot of women out there these days [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4062.4s)]
*  who are open to sex just to help help somebody out. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4065.36s)]
*  But I don't know if you have a suggestion for Tyler to you [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4074.1600000000003s)]

*  I've been having sex in the last, I don't know, two years. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4122.88s)]
*  And I just need some some advice now. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4127.68s)]
*  Yeah, you're driving across California. You can drive. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4131.04s)]
*  You can talk and drive on the phone at the same time. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4133.84s)]
*  Somebody will fuck you, bro. I think. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4136.16s)]
*  Yeah, somebody will for sure, dude. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4139.76s)]
*  So I think just stay active, man. Stay alive. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4142.96s)]
*  If somebody has a great suggestion for Tyler, you can [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQQraoNKFRA&t=4147.2s)]
