*  So I filmed the movie in Mississippi kind of where Theo like grew up a little bit [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=89.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  And and then I just remembered talking because I always talk about comedy like I love it [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  It was listening the podcast on set like a while before like I would go and fill my scenes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=99.2s)]
*  This past weekend and one of the PAs came up to me [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=104.66s)]
*  My friend Jared and he knocked on the door and he's like, are you listening to Theo? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=108.5s)]
*  And I was like yeah, dude, like I love Theo and he's like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  Oh like burned like the guys that smooths down there like they all know Theo and I was like really [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=113.86s)]
*  So we filmed the movie whatever and then afterwards like and no one knows who burn is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=118.66s)]
*  Yeah, burn is the drummer in a bishop gun whose dad I used to work on his farm in the summertime up in Mississippi [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=122.82s)]
*  So he was working as a PA or as a transport or something on the movie that you filmed in in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=129.12s)]
*  Mississippi, yeah, and then so so you ran into one of his buddies and he's like, oh burn knows him [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=136.68s)]
*  Yeah, and then that's how it all came to pass. Yeah, and then I was like, I'd love to help, you know help the podcast [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=141.4s)]
*  I love it. I listen to it, you know, and you know, I do social media stuff [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  So that's kind of how we all linked up and then yeah the rest is history [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=149.0s)]
*  That's it been together for a year and a year dude. And so first I want to talk about the movie [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=152.38s)]
*  So the movie is Octavia Spencer is the lead of the movie. Yes, is that a safe term? Yeah. Yeah, okay [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=157.2s)]
*  She's like the main lead. Okay, and so and so the movie is called ma [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=162.6s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and it comes out May 31st. So this is gonna air May 30th. So tomorrow it comes out. Okay [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=167.6s)]
*  Yeah, wow, so the movie comes out tomorrow and let's stop real quick [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  So we got a bunch of white kids going to drink in a black woman's basement. Correct. Correct. Basically. Yeah, okay [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we have one one. There's another African American with us. Okay [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=183.6s)]
*  So and is there any like is any of the movies that like oh is there racial stuff in the movie or not? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=187.2s)]
*  Really? Not so much. Um towards the end. There's like you will see it in the trailer. Oh, it does [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=193.1s)]
*  Touch on it a little bit, but it's not right [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=199.72s)]
*  It really has nothing to do with like the film in that sense [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  Like it's just more like yeah, like a black woman can be a serial killer too. You know what I mean? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah, you just give away the whole movie. No, no, I'm just saying like like it's possible for a black woman to be like a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Villain, right? I didn't mean she's a see what you're saying. Oh, yeah, I guess that's true, huh? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=216.28s)]
*  They don't have like a lot. Well, I guess even just growing up [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=220.32s)]
*  They didn't have like a lot of black characters in in a lot of movies. I'm trying to think of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=222.32s)]
*  Like a black villain that they had yeah [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=226.96s)]
*  Gray skull member that guy from he man [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=229.88s)]
*  well [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=231.68s)]
*  see what I find interesting is like I like would look in the internet and people like [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=232.16s)]
*  Would get upset that they'd be like well, why is the African American the villain? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=236.08s)]
*  Yeah, like no that's like the total opposite of like what Octavia wants like she wants to be the villain [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=240.04s)]
*  She wants to everyone can play every role like there's not like a she doesn't have to play a nurse or a maid in every movie [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=244.72s)]
*  Like right, of course. Yeah, and there's always black [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=251.64s)]
*  Like there's this thing out there that's just black anger like anytime a black person like open like breathe somebody's like [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=253.76s)]
*  Oh, why do they have to breathe? You know, yeah, like a black person like oh they have to breathe in the same planet as white people [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=258.8s)]
*  You know [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=264.24s)]
*  So sometimes you just get that black anger out there was it intimidating because this is your first like lead [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  so [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=271.76s)]
*  So you're one of the what do you play in the film? So I play Chaz [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=272.88s)]
*  He is a it's one of the teens where we party with Octavia and it's just like a high school kid [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=276.46s)]
*  There's five of us and yeah, and we meet Octavia and she starts buying us booze and alcohol [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=282.84s)]
*  And we're is it real booze when you're on the movie? No, it's just water. Oh, yeah [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=287.62s)]
*  So what thing is there pretend to be drunk? Yeah, you have to like you have like also [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=292.28s)]
*  There's also a scene there's a clip of it and on the Instagram [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  Where I like drink the the water and I go and I'm like, it's just literally water [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=299.64s)]
*  But you have to like I guess play it as if it was yeah [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=304.72s)]
*  But the worst part was the fucking joints like cuz I smoked the whole movie and pretty much every scene [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=307.52s)]
*  And I'm smoking the joints and it's like fake tobacco [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  So you're like I'm waking up my lungs are fried because I'm smoking it for like four hours, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=315.8s)]
*  You still smoke. Yeah, but it's not even real tobacco. Would you rather have been just regular tobacco? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=321.16s)]
*  I would have rather it have been like [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=325.4s)]
*  Maybe like like like vape juice or like something like that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=328.44s)]
*  like not because they would roll joints like that like I would rather have just vape the whole movie instead of like just [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=331.48s)]
*  Legit like cuz you're still smoking like the spliffs. Is that what they call them like the horse legs boy. Yeah [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  boy [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=344.24s)]
*  Of course Yanni's name is Chaz in the movie [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  Twink name ever all my names have been Brayden and power Chaz [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  Brian [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=357.0s)]
*  Forgot there was Brayden and Chaz. Yeah, dude. Those are such I feel like those are like white slave [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=359.0s)]
*  You're gonna get me in trouble dude, no, I'm sorry [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=366.44s)]
*  Sure it is you don't have an identity boy [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=372.2s)]
*  Your name is Randall. Yeah, and you're Russian or fraternity [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=374.84s)]
*  Um, so you get put into a lot of roles. I know you've said this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=379.08s)]
*  And so also so just to clarify so also Johnny's done all the book and Johnny Kim one has done all the booking [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=383.16s)]
*  For almost all the guests that we've had really or reached out to him [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  I've gotten a couple hitters, but yeah for the most part for the most part it does help a lot [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  May get a good thing going. Yeah, you know you guys have been great, man [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=396.88s)]
*  You guys put up with me a lot of times which I know isn't easy especially over text message [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  And I would name five guests that we've tried to get that we haven't gotten [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=403.28000000000003s)]

*  Like Anna Ferris like people who also have podcast Dax Shepard, right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=418.88s)]
*  Those are the people who I have reached out to just because they're kind of in that world and it's realistic. Okay [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=422.72s)]
*  Um, I wanted to boosty little boosty little boosty little boosty. Yeah, we tried yeah [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=427.20000000000005s)]

*  I'd go right to bed make sure I was off book for the next day. I'd wake up at 5 a.m [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=723.64s)]

*  God man, that's crazy. Yeah, and what would you do then paint yourself green and just attack people? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=768.64s)]

*  It was just some guy that was yelling at us. I was probably fucked up [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=855.26s)]
*  Yeah, but I truly did love it like the people there were so nice [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  I specifically remember going to Mississippi and then I would like if we go to the markets on the weekends [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=861.4599999999999s)]

*  it's just like there's more value on just like [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=891.5s)]
*  But do you think that that kind of stuff is real? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=895.46s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder if it's like a genuine or if there's just that people there's more time for people to spend with each other [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=897.4200000000001s)]

*  He's a workhorse and he's like very strategic and like what he's doing like, I don't know [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2053.52s)]

*  You know you like you can [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2063.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, especially since you get to see like what the podcast world is like and then also see like what the Hollywood world is like [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2065.4399999999996s)]
*  It's like yeah, you'll be able to probably learn enough to [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2071.08s)]
*  Kind of hedge your hedge one against the other at certain points [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2075.64s)]
*  You know to probably if you wanted to produce your own thing or make your own film that you wanted to star in [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2079.18s)]
*  It's like you knew you know [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2083.4399999999996s)]
*  It's like you know where you can find an audience for it if it's something that's good [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2084.7999999999997s)]
*  Which I think a lot of it is going like it's going away from Hollywood and it's going more towards like it's you in your [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2088.12s)]
*  Hands, you know, I mean cuz I like I'm writing in and trying to you know [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2093.0s)]
*  Develop my own show and you know, like that's the way the way it's going [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2097.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? You don't need Hollywood as much as you used to. Yeah [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2101.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you can really make your own Hollywood kind of yeah, you know [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2104.82s)]
*  I mean you gotta have I [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2108.38s)]
*  Just I can't see how it's not gonna go more that direction [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2112.64s)]
*  There's so many different [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2115.56s)]
*  Outlets now like these other streaming services are getting like more money behind them [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2117.32s)]
*  Like I mean, this is sports obviously but like that does own [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2121.4s)]
*  Channel like it's then it's now on par with the quality of content that like ESPN streaming services putting out and it came out [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2125.6800000000003s)]
*  Of nowhere and the cold a Dazon it's spelled da ZN. Honestly, that's their biggest problem is the branding [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2132.6s)]
*  Yeah, like they signed Canelo for like 300 million. They got money behind them, right? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2137.8s)]
*  It's a whole strategy, but these things are springing up all over [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2141.96s)]
*  So there's if you put out good content, you're gonna find a place and someone who's gonna give you money to produce it [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2144.96s)]
*  And it doesn't have to be through the traditional channels because it's almost like like me undies doesn't go to a store anymore [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2149.76s)]
*  They go directly to people and that's what the content creators are doing [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2156.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird cuz it's also like the whole like Louis CK like he just doesn't even need any networks [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2159.7000000000003s)]
*  He just has his own website and people go in and listen to his special [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2165.0800000000004s)]
*  You know what? He means it's like he doesn't need Netflix to buy a special [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2169.5600000000004s)]
*  He can just put it out on his own. So well the first one he did but then after that he went back to net [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2172.2400000000002s)]
*  I think he did he sell it hit sell the one that was already up on his thing back to them [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2176.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure that's a good question because then he made double the amount of money [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2181.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? He sold it to everyone and then was like, okay, I made all my money. No one's buying it anymore [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2184.3599999999997s)]
*  I'll sell to Netflix people will still watch it'll get [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2188.4399999999996s)]
*  Exposure and I'll make money right and if you would have we might have said this on the podcast before but if he would have [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2191.64s)]
*  Had like a podcast during the whole time [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2197.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2199.72s)]
*  he could have even not went away and like still had like this groundswell of people in his corner that like [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2200.04s)]
*  Like I don't know like yeah, he did something wrong [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2206.3999999999996s)]
*  But we're not gonna just drop him completely instead of going dormant or whatever for the last year and a half. Yeah [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2209.2s)]
*  yeah, it's kind of interesting to like, you know, it's kind of interesting and it's kind of like scary to think about like [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2214.52s)]
*  Yeah, like what [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2221.6s)]

*  Because so many people listen and watch podcasts and go to more than cable now [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2230.16s)]
*  Yeah and go to see those entertainers, you know, and that those are the entertainers that people go out to see [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2234.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's just kind of like it kind of like doesn't plague me sometimes but it just had me thinking like well [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2241.3999999999996s)]
*  What are the possibilities of like creating our own, you know network? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2245.74s)]
*  Yeah, and then just getting advertisers attached so that we don't have you know notes and it can just be straight out of our own brains [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2250.72s)]
*  Well, I'm super excited about your special because I mean, I don't know if I mean most of you guys have probably seen Theo on the [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2258.2s)]

*  Unique talent but I think we could find people who we think have potential that aren't seen and produce their own pods and [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2519.44s)]
*  recreate kind of the formula we have like [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2526.84s)]
*  The clips channel and the Instagrams that that help blow them up and then with our connections the other pod get them put out [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2528.96s)]
*  And I think we could we could have our own network. I mean your mom's house is doing it. Yeah, no reason we can't yeah [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2535.04s)]
*  I want to do like our own. Yeah, we should steal dr. Drew from a man. He's so good [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2540.52s)]
*  Our own potential potential like production company like onward productions, and we do our own shit in-house [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2545.32s)]
*  You don't need to go to some sketchy thing we sell our own ads [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2551.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like it's it's all together and it's like a collaborative creative experience [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2554.32s)]
*  You know, it's not like you have to deal with some guy in a fucking suit telling you you're not funny enough [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2557.86s)]
*  You're like, well, what have you ever done? You know what I mean? Yeah [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2561.32s)]
*  Yeah, no look man. I mean it would definitely be neat [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2564.22s)]
*  You know, I think my fears are just you know doing too much other stuff side. I can't do stand-up that much [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2566.42s)]
*  Yeah, or I don't do it [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2571.58s)]
*  But I do think it's like use your umbrella though like don't necessarily pile on you more stuff [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2573.06s)]
*  But it's like use your umbrella [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2579.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2580.38s)]
*  To put on other stuff like you start you start growing like you're just branches off and it doesn't always have to be you [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2580.82s)]
*  You like [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2587.26s)]
*  When we have someone with a show you're their first guest and stuff [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2588.7s)]
*  Kind of help pop them off, but then we go running with them. Yeah, it's like the same thing like what Kevin Hart does [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2592.82s)]
*  I mean he has heartbeat productions and he does so many different shows and like executive produces them and like creatively, you know helps him [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2598.1400000000003s)]
*  But he has really not much to do with it [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2605.1800000000003s)]
*  It's just kind of his name and his brand will help get it out there [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2607.0200000000004s)]
*  He is lol network to which like an out lot of love. It's it's more [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2610.1200000000003s)]
*  Skewed Facebook a lot. Yeah, I actually interviewed them before I was at Funny or Die and I almost had it [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2614.98s)]
*  But I think I didn't know it was as urban as it was and I kept telling him like they have all this just for laughs [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2621.3s)]
*  Content they own a bunch of that and I was like, oh, that's like where you want to go and that's like nerdy white comedy [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2625.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and so I think that's kind of where I Jerry Seinfeld [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2630.0600000000004s)]
*  What's the big deal [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2635.7000000000003s)]
*  Watermelon, have you heard of this guy Theo from Louisiana? Oh, that's a bad example because you you got that swag. But yeah [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2637.78s)]
*  Yeah, dude, black guys love you man. You yeah, I wish someone would come to the shows [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2644.1800000000003s)]
*  There's been 11 that have come to the shows I think this really yeah, and they're always like hey man [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2649.42s)]
*  Just want to let you know you have some black support [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2655.06s)]
*  And one of my friends Stan that came to two shows [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2657.94s)]
*  Like I told all my friends about you and they beat the shit out of me [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2662.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but dude, you know what? I was thinking there's not a lot of crossover in music [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2665.62s)]
*  There's a lot of crossover right? I think crossovers in what like like if you look at black and white audiences that go to see [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2670.36s)]
*  Entertainment, you know a lot of there [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2677.42s)]
*  There's still a lot of like a lot of black audience to go to see black stuff a lot of white audience to go to [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2679.5800000000004s)]
*  See kind of white stuff. Well, I think I mean I think it bends in some places music is definitely a place where it bends a [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2684.1000000000004s)]
*  lot well, I think because I [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2689.34s)]
*  Like Post Malone, I don't think a lot of black people go see Post Malone [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2691.34s)]
*  But like Drake like like black people go see Drake and like white people go see Drake [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2695.78s)]
*  So I think it's more the black artists that the white people love but I feel like sometimes when it's a white artist [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2700.5s)]
*  Like there's not support from maybe the black community is like oh, he's like he's like white like trying to like take like what we created [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2706.7799999999997s)]
*  So I think like that's kind of what Michael Rappaport. Yeah, like you don't carry on a little [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2713.74s)]
*  Yeah, actually black people really fuck with Gary own, but he married also a black woman [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2718.98s)]
*  I think you have to go that far really like Neil Brennan. He married Dave Chappelle. So yeah [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2723.1s)]
*  He married himself a couple times too, I think it'd be good [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2730.2599999999998s)]
*  Bill Burr Bill Burr. Yep, but he's got his [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2733.34s)]
*  Content is so white like it's like remember I was driving at the McDonald's. It's like black people like no [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2737.42s)]
*  We don't remember that you know, I mean, yeah, he's just so frustrated with everything. Yeah the best [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2743.26s)]
*  Yeah, have you seen those two black guys? They have a YouTube channel and they'll watch like white comic stuff [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2747.7000000000003s)]
*  They've done one on you and they just absolutely loved it and I've seen one on them do burr [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2753.3s)]
*  I want to find their names cuz yeah, those guys are great. Yeah, it is interesting [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2757.6600000000003s)]
*  I wonder if there's like, um, I [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2761.7s)]
*  Think it would do that. I think it would if there were more [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2764.4199999999996s)]
*  And maybe this will just happen with time where more black people support white things and not think that it's like there [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2768.66s)]
*  Because a lot of white people aren't like support my stuff. I'm like a you know, like they don't have any there's no ego [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2774.22s)]
*  There's no racial ego in it. Yeah, I think there's sometimes there's probably like [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2780.46s)]
*  you know when you've been like a [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2784.4199999999996s)]
*  Community that's been like historically kind of like held held in of such a place and not had opportunity then you probably think like oh [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2786.26s)]
*  Yeah, this is our opportunity. Like why are you taking this from us? Like we have this, you know what I mean? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2793.26s)]
*  Why are you taking that too? I guess it may be what the feeling is but out here on the west coast [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2798.5s)]
*  I see a lot more guys who were just like it doesn't really matter [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2801.9s)]
*  I think that is one thing you find more and even just as as time goes on [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2804.3s)]
*  I see a lot more people it doesn't really matter kind of that's where I see it going where it's like like a lot of it [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2808.0600000000004s)]
*  Now is that like yeah, you want to give diverse people jobs like which is great [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2812.86s)]
*  Like I fully support that but it's like like I I'm hoping in like the next like 30 years where it's just like no one [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2817.3s)]
*  Gives a fuck. It's equal the funniest person gets the job [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2822.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the best writer gets the writing job the best actor gets acting job [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2825.5s)]
*  Like yeah, we want it to be diverse, but like it should be like that shouldn't matter [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2828.94s)]
*  You know, I mean it should just be who's the best. Yeah [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2832.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's been as long as everybody has the opportunity exactly. That's right [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2835.3s)]
*  You know and also I think one thing is like, you know a lot of like with struggle comes [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2838.7s)]
*  Without struggle you don't get any you know, you got to have some to get to have something [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2845.54s)]

*  softer black athletes over time, you know as like yeah once like great like [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=2856.42s)]

*  Did you specify it wasn't me? That's that's always what I'm who's the clown with the microphone? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3539.84s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus love the F but that guy [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3544.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but I've gotten better a lot of people are like, okay, like it's good [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3548.44s)]
*  So I got my microphone back and no more laugh. I cover my mouth [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3552.26s)]
*  Well, I think that's why this episode is good because people can experience a little bit more the joy [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3555.5s)]
*  Yeah, we call him joy on II. Yeah, you know and and yeah, it's uh [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3558.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, man, it actually is really a blessing. I'm glad that you and Nick have a good rapport, you know, even when I'm not around because [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3565.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think if it were [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3571.56s)]
*  Yeah, I just I know I couldn't keep [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3573.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know if we'd probably still be together for Johnny passing through with the joy sometimes [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3577.9599999999996s)]
*  Because it's been a lot. It's just been a lot of work. It's been a lot of work for Nick [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3582.24s)]
*  It's been a lot of work of back and forth and read and so [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3585.16s)]
*  Yeah, well that's originally why I wanted to start with you like like I mean [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3588.4s)]
*  I'm not gonna say I'm gonna say like I saw like so much potential cuz I like like I think I was like [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3592.92s)]
*  This guy is gonna be fucking huge like people just don't know about him yet [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3598.16s)]
*  And I'm like I want to help in any way I can because I assumed it's like pretty fucking stressful [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3600.7200000000003s)]
*  You're on the road like you're trying to sell tickets. You're doing a podcast [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3605.44s)]
*  So that's when I originally came and was like I want to help with social media stuff and like I mean [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's what you've done man. And look you've done it to an end. Yeah, you're right, man [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3613.1s)]
*  You said I just want to help and you know, that's a good going Nick. I was just gonna say booking is not [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3616.16s)]
*  It's the worst like there are companies that like people pay [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3621.6s)]
*  thousands of dollars to do like get guests for them and stuff like and especially if we're trying to hit a specific day like [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3624.8399999999997s)]
*  It's not easy and I'm [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3630.48s)]
*  Super glad I don't have to do it. Yes. Yeah, that's true, man [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3632.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't even know if we could have had get like I don't know [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3635.72s)]
*  I mean, I guess I don't know if I was planning on doing I had no idea what the plan was [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3637.8799999999997s)]
*  When I came in we only had J Moore in a Greyhound bus driver, oh and that whole the homeless guy [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3642.36s)]
*  What about the homeless guy? Oh uneven steven? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3647.08s)]
*  He must not be doing well. I haven't gotten a text back with him in a while about eight months [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3649.92s)]
*  but then we also had some faults like if we can look back like the [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3654.64s)]
*  The guy who had Tourette's which we don't really know if he beats Tourette's and then we found out later that he was involved [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3658.72s)]
*  In a sex cult where they all got everybody got Tourette's [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3664.16s)]
*  I didn't know it was an STD [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3668.64s)]
*  And [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3672.04s)]
*  And the crazy part is one day these same people are gonna be probably maybe sooner than later gonna be emailing you back to book [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3674.04s)]
*  You they'll be like, yeah, we'd love to have that person on. Can you come on our podcast? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3679.44s)]
*  Yeah, which is funny because now I do have a publicist because you know a couple months before the movie out the movie comes out [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3683.04s)]
*  You want to like, you know, like I go on podcasts because I want people to see the movie [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3687.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? And she helps me with that and it's kind of interesting because yeah [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3692.3s)]
*  That is like I was I email other people like Bobby Lee. I'm going on Tiger Belly [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3696.94s)]
*  Well, I would have already have been on [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3701.12s)]
*  But yeah, like before I'm emailing like hey George [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3703.4s)]
*  Can we get Bobby on this past weekend and then it's kind of the opposite now like hey, yeah [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3706.0s)]
*  You want to come on my Tiger Bell? Yeah, it's cool, man. Yeah, and Gianni's getting cornered by the shows [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3709.28s)]
*  He goes on why isn't why can't I go on Theo's show? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3713.52s)]
*  Twice [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3719.96s)]
*  You're at they're asking you why aren't you on Theo's show? No, no, no, they're asking me why they are an on Theo's show [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3721.28s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. Well look talk to my booker [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3726.0s)]
*  That's [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3729.08s)]
*  The only thing I can say man. That's why I don't handle it dude for the tape even that well [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3730.28s)]
*  The funny thing is now like even David Spade the other day like he's like, hey, man [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3735.32s)]
*  I need I think I need some help with this podcast thing and I'm like, that's just crazy that Dane [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3738.9s)]
*  Coates just checks. Hey man, I'd love to come back on the podcast. So we're gonna have him me and Dane have the same publicist [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3743.8s)]
*  You'll do yeah, that's that's a studio one day. You never know. Yeah, it's like and we can make good content and stuff [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3748.8s)]
*  That's more fair. I think you know and people can own a part of what they do [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3755.44s)]
*  Yeah [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3758.12s)]
*  Cuz it's kind of bullshit that no one owns like the stuff like you're a showrunner and you don't have any say and what happens [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3758.88s)]
*  To your show. Yeah, it's like this is mine [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3764.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like this is my people do 20 years of development to get stuff made and these these personalities like [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3766.08s)]
*  When they go on networks, usually they get stifled and it doesn't end up being them [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3772.96s)]
*  Like David Spade could have an awesome podcast. I really want if he wanted to he could be so good [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3776.94s)]
*  Yeah, now is he looking to do one? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3781.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's saying like who would be a good co-host for me to do one with you know [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3784.92s)]
*  How are we gonna do it though? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3789.92s)]
*  We'll talk we'll talk about our affair but like yeah, yeah [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3791.92s)]
*  Would be dope dude [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3795.76s)]
*  I've the other night so you know obviously name dropping here [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3797.36s)]
*  But I went and met up with spade to get some food just have dinner and I'm walking up to the restaurant open the door [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3800.4s)]
*  And Swartz and comes running up behind me to like scare me [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3804.46s)]
*  Scared the fuck out of me, dude. Did he shit himself? I did it. I think that was his move. Yeah [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3807.4s)]
*  He's like dang you were so scared. I just shit myself [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3813.92s)]
*  But but then we stood around and talked for like two minutes and it was literally one of the funniest conversations that I've ever been [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3817.76s)]
*  Really see that see what that's this the stuff that I fucking love like I when I'm going on set with actors [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3822.6800000000003s)]
*  Like it's not that I don't get along with them because I do like I met Corey [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3828.26s)]
*  but I feel like out of place because they're like very like like PC and it's like you have to do this and I [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3832.16s)]
*  Trained at Juilliard and that's not the way I am like I fucking chill with you and like, you know [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3839.36s)]
*  Like when I went to the comic store that night Bobby Lee and Krystal Lee and Sebastian are all standing around like that's like [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3843.72s)]
*  I'm not saying like that's like who I think I am [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3848.2999999999997s)]
*  But like that's like the crew that I like feel like a part of like and then I go on set [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3850.56s)]
*  With other people who are like actors and they're just like they're kind of like off-putting. Yeah, you don't take it as seriously [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3855.36s)]
*  You know me take it seriously, you know work, but you don't take it as seriously in your ego [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3862.42s)]
*  And that's something Nick said earlier [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3865.68s)]
*  Actors are like empty vessels almost like they're told like be here say this do this and I feel like it bleeds into it [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3868.24s)]
*  Like most of that's why you don't have to see actors on this show a lot [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3874.64s)]
*  I don't find them as interesting generally. Yeah, I don't have a ton of life experience like yeah stuff [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3877.2799999999997s)]
*  But Gianni was a hockey player. That's true dude. Johnny was a hockey player [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3882.12s)]
*  I mean look Gianni could be the hottest twink in this fucking city. You don't see a twink pound-for-pound as [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3885.6s)]
*  You know and a twink is a sort of a lean what is a twink Gianni? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3893.48s)]
*  It's more like a young hairless [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3897.3599999999997s)]
*  Kind of like a little skinnier boyish gay male. Yeah. Yeah that all the older gay men one [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3899.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and then one yeah [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3906.4399999999996s)]
*  They hire them to like carry muffins around and fold drapes and stuff [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3907.56s)]
*  My mom actually was like why does why is everyone commenting on your Instagram? You know get that hit a twink [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3911.12s)]

*  You know what I mean like she is an Oscar-winning actress and then you get on set and she's crazy [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HIk5wIYNI&t=3983.16s)]
