*  Yeah, here's another one of those chuckle honkies [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=539.96s)]
*  as a lot of people. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=542.6s)]
*  Yeah, here's another chuckle honky, that classic term. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=543.44s)]
*  And look, whoever, someone else probably made that term. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=548.44s)]
*  If you bring it up right now, there's some. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=551.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's a chuckle honky. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=553.88s)]
*  And it's just our photos on a giraffe, weirdly. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=557.12s)]
*  Don't know why. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=559.72s)]
*  But some other kid drew us in his journal. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  Some third grader in Minnesota put us in his journal [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=563.24s)]
*  and it's actually our pictures. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=565.64s)]
*  Like, how did he even do that? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=567.52s)]
*  And he wrote pod podcaster underneath your photo, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  actor underneath mine. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=572.84s)]
*  And the year was 2012. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=575.32s)]
*  And look at us now. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=576.7199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=577.52s)]
*  But no, congratulations. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=579.4s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because you start off [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=580.2399999999999s)]
*  just as a comedian. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=582.92s)]
*  I mean, that's. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=583.76s)]
*  Yeah, essentially, I mean, we knew each other [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=585.04s)]
*  since being in the hallways of the improv [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=587.64s)]
*  back in the day. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=590.3599999999999s)]
*  Was your goal always to be an actor? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you and I talked about this or not. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=594.4s)]
*  I know you've had workaholics. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=596.68s)]
*  I know you've had a string of movies. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=597.76s)]
*  I know all of this. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=599.2399999999999s)]
*  But I'm just wondering where your original idea was [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=600.4799999999999s)]
*  because it's interesting when a comedian goes, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  they get into movies and they become a movie star. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=605.08s)]
*  Not a lot of people have that path. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  So it's just different. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  You're a rare person we can talk to about that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah, it was kind of always the dream. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=612.24s)]
*  The dream was like, the dream was basically [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=615.32s)]
*  like Sandler's path, path. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=617.48s)]
*  You know, like seeing what he was able to do, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=619.44s)]
*  do stand up. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  I wanted to do SNL that just never came to be. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  And then do movies. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, essentially, I started, when I was a kid, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  I watched a lot of like Evening at the Improv. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=633.36s)]
*  Remember that A&E show with like Bud Freeman, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=636.44s)]
*  he wears monocle and then they bring up the comics. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=638.36s)]
*  And I never saw it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=641.92s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=643.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=644.16s)]
*  Was it that, is that the guy with the, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=645.24s)]
*  well, Bud Freeman is the Improv owner and he died. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=647.32s)]
*  He just died, yeah, not too long ago. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=649.92s)]
*  But he, yeah, so I like loved stand up. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=651.96s)]
*  And then you watched so much of it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=656.16s)]
*  And I'm sure you kind of did the same thing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=658.04s)]
*  It wasn't like, for me, it wasn't like the best comics. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=660.4s)]
*  They didn't inspire me because I was like, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm not that smart. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=666.08s)]
*  Like I can't figure that shit out. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=667.2s)]
*  Oh, you mean like a Louis C.K. or a Steven Wright [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=668.84s)]
*  or somebody like. Yeah, or like a Chris Rock [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=671.08s)]
*  or someone. Oh yeah, Chris Rock. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=672.96s)]
*  You know, where you're just like, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=674.52s)]
*  oh God, these guys are geniuses. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=675.36s)]
*  It was like the guys I saw on TV that like weren't that good. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=676.96s)]
*  And I was like, well, I could be that good. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=680.2s)]
*  Right. I know I could be that good. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=681.84s)]
*  If that's what it takes, that's what it takes to get on TV. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=685.84s)]
*  I know I could be that successful. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=688.88s)]
*  I can do that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=690.96s)]
*  Yeah. And so and then even at the improv had everybody. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=692.08s)]
*  But it was watching some of these people and they were like, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=694.4s)]
*  oh, they're not that funny, dude. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=699.0s)]
*  I can be that funny. Right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  And then I got a job at the improv, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=703.12s)]
*  which I think is probably around when I met you. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=706.32s)]
*  And and I was in like 2004. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=709.24s)]
*  Was Anthony Clark working there then too? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=712.12s)]
*  Or not? Do you remember that? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=713.84s)]
*  Anthony Clark wasn't. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=715.04s)]
*  Yeah, he was there all the time. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=716.36s)]
*  But he wasn't working there then. No, because I would see. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=717.76s)]
*  Oh, no, he never worked. He never worked there. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=720.08s)]
*  He was just always he was always there. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=721.72s)]
*  Was he there then? That's what I mean. Yeah. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=723.12s)]
*  I thought he worked. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=724.72s)]
*  No, he was he was drinking at the bar so much that we should have paid him. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=725.8s)]
*  Yeah. Sorry, Anthony. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=730.92s)]
*  I haven't seen Anthony Clark in years and no one has. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=732.52s)]
*  Wow. He was a he was a television star. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=735.52s)]
*  I mean, he was one of the biggest shows. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=738.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yes, dear. Yes, dear. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=740.96s)]
*  And then his other shows, Boston Common. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=743.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=746.2s)]
*  And that deep cut references. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  I have to get to I would love to sit and talk with Anthony Clark. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=750.24s)]
*  I bet it would be really interesting. Oh, yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=752.84s)]
*  Wow. I haven't seen him in years. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=755.0s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway, sorry. I hadn't thought about that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=756.84s)]
*  So you worked at the improv. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=758.08s)]
*  Yeah. And then it was like it was you crushed when you got on stage. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=759.84s)]
*  We did a show at USC together one time, I remember. Yeah, that's right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=763.5600000000001s)]
*  And that might have been maybe when Warcolex was out. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=766.84s)]
*  And then after that came out, it was just [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=770.44s)]
*  you just went into this other world that a lot of us aren't in. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=773.32s)]
*  Yeah. We got we got so fucking lucky. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=777.0s)]
*  You know, it was like that's what it is. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=779.4s)]
*  It's like you just sort of prepare and try to put yourself in the right place [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=781.32s)]
*  at the right time and then and then you get your shot [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=785.04s)]
*  and hopefully you're able to hit it, you know. Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=787.96s)]
*  And we got so lucky. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=789.88s)]
*  It was funny like when Warcolex came out because like [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=791.4s)]
*  I was kind of the kid at the improv where I was like working the door and shit. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=794.64s)]
*  And then I'd come on stage and like there wasn't a ton of respect. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=798.76s)]
*  Where it's like, yeah, we know he worked here. Right. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=802.96s)]
*  And I guess some of you that guy would even be up there. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=805.76s)]
*  He'd be mid order. He'd be taking his fries. They'd call his name. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=807.6s)]
*  I remember watching one guy do it. I was I'm with fries in his hand. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=811.04s)]
*  Yeah. So it wasn't like a [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=815.24s)]
*  and then as soon as the the show came out, Warcolex came out. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=818.0s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, it was like all the older comics were like, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=821.5600000000001s)]
*  oh, hey, what's up, man? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=824.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, bitch, you don't know me. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=825.48s)]
*  Oh, so now we're friends. OK. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=830.6s)]
*  Hollywood is weird like that, man. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=832.68s)]
*  It is weird. There's a certain sometimes there's a certain like [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=834.64s)]
*  you want someone needs to have the same experiences as you. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=839.12s)]
*  And then that can bring you it can make you feel like you can talk to somebody [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=842.4399999999999s)]
*  or things are a little more comfortable. Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=846.12s)]
*  There are weird. Well, yeah, there's there's like [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=848.12s)]
*  there's levels to this shit, as Meek Mill said. Yeah. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=851.24s)]
*  And it's true. It's like you just talk to people that are like [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=854.72s)]
*  I feel like we are kind of in the same class within like a few years [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=857.6s)]
*  of each other, kind of know, you know, and and then there's like kids [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=861.2s)]
*  that are coming up that you're like, oh, they were the class beneath beneath us. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=865.8000000000001s)]

*  And we cast Pierce Brosnan. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1049.0s)]
*  Pierce Brosnan from 007. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1051.8s)]

*  Yeah. So it's the cast is sick. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1067.32s)]
*  So they pitched me this idea. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1068.76s)]
*  And I'm like, it's just a fucking idiot, dude. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1070.84s)]
*  And I was like, that is a brilliant idea for a movie. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1073.28s)]
*  I want to do this movie. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1076.12s)]
*  Wrote it down in my notebook. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1077.32s)]
*  Lost that notebook immediately. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1078.84s)]
*  Forgot all about it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1080.96s)]
*  And years later, I'm like looking through an old notebook being like, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1082.32s)]
*  oh, what what brilliance did I write down in here? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  What gold? And you're like, no, gross, hated. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1089.96s)]
*  Bad idea. Stupid recipe. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1093.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1096.04s)]
*  It just is apples. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1097.52s)]
*  It's just saying to eat fruit. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1099.3600000000001s)]
*  And then and then it was this idea. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1101.32s)]
*  And I was like, oh, fuck, that's brilliant. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1103.2s)]
*  I reached out to the those guys. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1105.48s)]
*  I was like, hey, I'm sure John Cena is attached. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1107.28s)]
*  Or, you know, someone has already beat me to this flavor. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1110.84s)]
*  Flav, flavor, flavor, is probably, you know, that movie star flavor, flavor. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1113.56s)]
*  And then they were like, no, nothing. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1117.84s)]
*  So I developed it with them. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1120.52s)]
*  We took it to Netflix, sold it and then brought on [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1122.9199999999998s)]
*  Happy Madison, Sam's company. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1126.0s)]
*  Oh, that's great. Now. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1128.04s)]
*  Now it was cool. It was. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1129.2s)]
*  It's cool when it works out, you know. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1130.28s)]
*  You know, it's so hard to get a movie created, created into the finish line, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1132.2s)]
*  especially these days. It seems even harder, dude, especially comedies. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1135.48s)]
*  Now, you have to like mask it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1138.56s)]
*  This is why it's a big action comedy, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1140.36s)]
*  because you really have to go like action, action. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1142.28s)]
*  And then and then it's a comedy. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  But this we it's just like it's it's why I was so happy to work [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1146.76s)]
*  with Sandler's Company is we could just go full steam on the comedy [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  as opposed to, you know, you watch comedies nowadays and you're like, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1154.4399999999998s)]
*  no, this isn't a fucking comedy. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1158.36s)]
*  You're not. Where's the jokes? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  Like, where's the bits? Bad. Yeah. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1161.56s)]
*  Comedy's gotten kind of bad. Yeah, kind of sucks. Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1163.52s)]
*  Movie comedy. Movie. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1166.52s)]
*  Yeah. And there's still good shows and stuff. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1167.8s)]
*  But like, yeah, movie comedy, it's it's hard. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1169.76s)]
*  But which luckily I my theory is, I think. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1173.04s)]
*  I think like Marvel ruined it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1179.2s)]
*  I feel like superhero movies kind of ruined comedies because they [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1181.48s)]
*  people watch you go to the theater and you're expect to watch something [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1188.6s)]
*  that costs 200 million dollars to make in comedy movies aren't that aren't that. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1192.72s)]
*  So you're like, well, why would I spend the same amount of money [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1197.8799999999999s)]
*  to go watch a little comedy in the theater? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1201.28s)]
*  If I could spend the same amount of money and go see something that is [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1204.32s)]
*  is worth 200 million dollars, right? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1207.72s)]
*  You know, and then they still make those movies kind of funny. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1209.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, I mean, they're not comedies, but there's like, right. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1212.9199999999998s)]
*  There's you're like, oh, my God, is that raccoon talking? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1215.6399999999999s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1218.8s)]
*  Which it is. But but yeah, so it's not it's not like a real comedy. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1222.04s)]
*  And then now they there used to be something like [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1227.72s)]
*  every studio would put out several comedies every every year. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1230.1599999999999s)]
*  And there was like 45 or 46 comedies in the theaters every year. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1233.12s)]
*  So about every week or every other week or so, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1238.32s)]
*  there's a new comedy in the theaters. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1241.0s)]
*  And and then now last year there was like six or seven. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1242.76s)]
*  That's crazy. It's crazy. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1247.96s)]
*  And people need and the crazy thing is, is it feels like people need comedy [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1249.32s)]
*  more than ever. Yeah, I feel like they want it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1252.8s)]
*  I feel. Yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1254.6s)]
*  So that's what this movie was. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1255.84s)]
*  It was like and there's no like hidden message. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1257.08s)]
*  I feel like nowadays people like you get to the end of what you think is a comedy. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  And you're like, is that about global warming? Yeah. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1265.12s)]

*  You know, it was your television and then it became your television and your computer. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's when streaming really was at an insane level, you know. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1684.8000000000002s)]
*  And then now it's your television, your computer and your phone. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1688.64s)]
*  You know, so I feel like it's. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1691.72s)]
*  Yeah, and it's also like the algorithm just kind of pushes things your way. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1693.8400000000001s)]
*  And if for whatever reason, yeah, it didn't push it your way, then you have no, no clue. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1698.48s)]
*  Oh, dude, I walked into the last blockbuster probably one years ago. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1704.88s)]
*  And I walked in there, dude, and it was like it was on. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1709.3600000000001s)]
*  It was unbelievable. And this is what was the most fascinating to me about it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1715.64s)]
*  First of all, somebody that worked in there was like, where was this? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1720.88s)]
*  They would look over their glass that you like you were being an asshole, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1723.2800000000002s)]
*  like which is like how they always one person always used to do that. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1725.72s)]
*  And one dude would be cool, like trying to say you weed or something, you know? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1728.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. This is in Bend, Oregon. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1730.88s)]
*  It's the last one. Oh, wow. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1732.84s)]
*  So there it is right there. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1734.8s)]
*  And that's because they don't get Internet up there or they're just really. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1736.48s)]
*  I think just this lady doesn't want it to shut down. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1741.08s)]
*  Whoever this is in the picture, maybe. Yeah, that's probably her. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1743.24s)]
*  But it's crazy. I mean, you go in and it's you walk through the aisles. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1746.1999999999998s)]
*  And the interesting part is how many options there are. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1749.72s)]
*  You don't realize how many because when we look on a screen, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1753.48s)]
*  there's like the 10 or 12 options. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1756.24s)]
*  And even if you look around, you can barely find. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1757.84s)]
*  But in the store, I mean, suddenly I'm like, oh, what about this movie? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1760.24s)]
*  I hadn't thought about this movie. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1764.0s)]
*  I pick it up. That's what. Oh, this one would really be great. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1765.4s)]
*  And I realized how much of our ability to choose for ourselves [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1768.0400000000002s)]
*  without even realizing it disappeared when it went to streaming platforms. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1772.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. It used to be funny. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1777.88s)]
*  You used to go just in like the weird artwork. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1779.3200000000002s)]
*  You'd be like, let's give this one a try. Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1781.68s)]
*  Like that that person showing like half of a nipple. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1784.72s)]
*  Yeah, some lady. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1787.68s)]
*  Oh, God, I see the other half. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1789.48s)]
*  You got to see the other half of the nipple. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1790.88s)]
*  I think they're going to show the bottom half of this nipple. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1792.24s)]
*  And I come on. Yeah, I got to read this. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1794.0800000000002s)]
*  And then the crazy part was if it was a nipple movie, I'd always get raising nets. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1796.64s)]
*  It's crazy because you want to have them sticky fingers. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1800.28s)]
*  Well, I just want to have it's almost that fourth dimension of a nipple. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1803.0s)]
*  They're almost little nipples in the box. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1805.92s)]
*  Dude, that'd be great for porn movies if they had a box of like little [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1808.16s)]
*  like it's you know how they have those like 4D seats in theaters now, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1811.76s)]
*  like a 4D porn chair that you [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1816.0800000000002s)]
*  all this you're just getting hoes spray weird smells like, oh, God. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1819.28s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. Too close. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1824.68s)]
*  Yeah. It's like and then it like bumps you from behind. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1827.24s)]
*  If there's like a doggy style scene or something like, well, this is well. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1829.88s)]
*  Who's that? Wait, so you're getting fucked. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1833.16s)]
*  Yeah. All right. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1835.52s)]
*  It depends. Yeah. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1836.3200000000002s)]
*  Depends on what you're watching. Yeah. Makes sense. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1837.48s)]
*  I think there's different types of chairs. For sure. Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1839.48s)]
*  You might have to invest in the right chair for you. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1842.68s)]
*  You know, that's what we're saying. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1845.88s)]
*  That's the right porn chair for you. That's all that matters. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1847.28s)]
*  But it was pretty fascinating just how many options there were. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  And I had never realized how much that went away. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1854.52s)]
*  I mean, because next, you know, I'm in the drama section, then I'm in the comedy. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1857.0s)]
*  And then I'm seeing like, oh, what about this one, dude? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1860.2s)]
*  I never saw this. I heard this came out. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1862.4s)]
*  And but it was like I had so much ability to choose. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1864.68s)]
*  And it was it was anyway, it was just kind of fast. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1868.5600000000002s)]
*  And it was fun because then you would watch those movies. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1871.32s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1874.04s)]
*  Like, that's what you were going to do that night. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1874.9199999999998s)]
*  Like Netflix and and, you know, all the streaming services. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1877.32s)]
*  I love I love Netflix. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1881.72s)]
*  Yeah. They are my good guy. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1883.28s)]
*  They are my corporate overlords. But. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1884.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, we're talking about how the business has changed, and that's OK. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1889.04s)]
*  They're worried about it, too. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1891.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. But like, you could just turn off a movie. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1892.52s)]
*  You could watch 15 minutes of something and go, affect. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1895.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't want to do this now. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1898.48s)]
*  But like when you had the movie and that was what you're doing, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1900.2s)]
*  you would watch a bad movie and watch the entire thing [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1902.92s)]
*  because you spent the eight dollars or whatever it was to rent the damn movie. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1905.72s)]
*  So you're like, well, we have to watch this piece of shit. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1909.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're fucking. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1912.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're not even showing the other half of the nipple. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1914.6000000000001s)]
*  So I don't know why we got to wait to the very end [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1917.3600000000001s)]
*  for the other half nipple to flop out. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1920.24s)]
*  Dude, hey, there was something about that, huh? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1922.92s)]
*  And also, I feel like I feel big candies, probably pretty bummed [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1926.2s)]
*  because you're no longer are you you're not going to the store [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1930.92s)]
*  because you're going to go home and watch Netflix and getting all the jujubes [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1934.88s)]
*  and Mike and Ikes and all the candies to malls, hot to malls. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1938.96s)]
*  What are other candies? Lemonheads. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1943.76s)]
*  Oh, lemonheads. Oh, the ones that had the little bitty [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=1945.48s)]

*  And one of my buddies, he drove a church van or something, or he [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2587.84s)]
*  commandeered one or whatever. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2592.4s)]

*  He stole a church van. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2596.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2597.48s)]

*  it got more detrimental to your health, like the further to the back you got. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2609.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2613.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2615.7999999999997s)]
*  There's just like a small fire back there. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2616.2s)]
*  Everybody's just cracked out, staying warm. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2618.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2621.6s)]
*  And one of the people staying warm is like an abortion that like made it. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2622.44s)]
*  You know, like four day old. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2625.68s)]
*  You know, there's a failed abortion clinic in the very back. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2628.64s)]
*  Or they can't figure it, quite figure it out. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2632.08s)]
*  They keep having babies. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2634.52s)]
*  But the front seat, they're just drinking like hard seltzer. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2635.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2639.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2639.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2639.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2639.7200000000003s)]
*  The front seat is just like, it's like people looking at a map, like looking at directions. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2639.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2643.96s)]
*  Just trying to figure out how to get back to the church. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2644.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2646.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2646.88s)]
*  Second seat is a hard seltzer. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2647.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2648.88s)]
*  Third seat is remedial reading. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2649.1600000000003s)]
*  That was always remedial reading. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2650.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2651.88s)]
*  So it was like, yeah, tutors. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2652.36s)]
*  Because if you can't read remedial, then you also like, then you probably can't handle [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2653.6000000000004s)]
*  hard seltzer. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2662.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2663.4s)]
*  Or no, that's probably the exact opposite. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2664.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2667.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2667.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2667.88s)]
*  If you can't read, you can drink hard seltzer as water all day long. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2668.44s)]
*  That's all you want to do. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2672.52s)]
*  And it got weird. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2673.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2674.6s)]
*  The further towards the back, it got weirder. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2675.0s)]
*  But yeah, they would come and they would test. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2676.92s)]
*  A lot of times they would give me the weed to test it out, you know, because I was kind [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2678.6s)]
*  of like, I would fall asleep a lot of times. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2681.8s)]
*  Like we'd go out. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2684.12s)]
*  I would literally fall asleep because the weed was real strong. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2684.84s)]
*  And then they'd wake me up when it was literally time to go home. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2687.56s)]
*  Like I'd miss the whole night. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2690.04s)]
*  You know, I had a real, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2691.16s)]
*  I had a real sleeping disorder maybe for like six or seven years kind of. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2693.64s)]
*  And so anyway, but yeah, I remember just being in my buddy's dad's van and we would, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2699.56s)]
*  and then we would sleep in there and just get really, really high. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2705.4s)]
*  And, and he, one of the, one of the kids, dad's had some sunglasses. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2708.7599999999998s)]
*  He sold sunglasses for a living or whatever. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2713.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=2716.04s)]

*  till high school and then after I graduated, I moved to LA. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3361.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3373.24s)]
*  It's just like a baseball field. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3373.56s)]
*  Yeah. Dyersville it is. I love the Midwest. My mom went to school over there in Iowa, but [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3374.7599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, it's cool. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3387.0s)]
*  It's cool. When you go see it, it's cool. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3387.96s)]
*  Yeah. Like the Midwest people like, people give it such a bad rap, but it is just, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3389.7999999999997s)]
*  people are so nice. It's like beautiful. Like Iowa's a very pretty state. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3396.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, I love it, man. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3402.04s)]
*  Rolling hills and just green, beautiful fields, you know, corn fields. It's cool. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3403.08s)]
*  Well, also like Purina Dog brand was from, there's a lot of famous old brands that are from there. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3409.24s)]
*  Like John Deere. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3414.12s)]
*  Yep. What else? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3415.8799999999997s)]
*  Russell Stover, I think. Where's that from? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3420.8399999999997s)]
*  God, imagine knowing him. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3425.72s)]
*  Russell? I'd love it. Kansas City, Missouri. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3427.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, right there. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3431.08s)]
*  Kansas City, Missouri. It's like, it's like accepted as the Midwest, even though I feel [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3432.52s)]
*  like it's getting a little wild west kind of. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3436.6s)]
*  It's a little bit. What I like about Kansas City is like that there was like a real mafia element. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3439.0s)]
*  Oh yes, because St. Louis has a mafia element. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3445.7999999999997s)]
*  Kansas City, there was like the Kansas City mob bosses and like they wouldn't go [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3448.52s)]
*  west to there. Like, so the mob bosses would be in there and they would control Vegas [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3452.92s)]
*  because they couldn't get any closer because the feds would come down on them. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3456.92s)]
*  Fuck, that's crazy. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3460.92s)]
*  At least that's what like casino taught me, the movie. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3461.32s)]
*  Yeah, I believe a lot of that. I believe a lot of that, man. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3464.36s)]
*  Is there a movie that you've been thinking about? Like, so you have this one done. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3469.32s)]
*  Is there like another movie that now you, like, do you have to wait to see how this one does to [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3474.6000000000004s)]
*  see if you get other opportunities? How does that kind of work in your business? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3479.08s)]
*  Because you've had a good, you've had a good run. A lot of guys don't get, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3482.7599999999998s)]
*  don't get some of the same opportunities, you know, for sure. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3486.04s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. You always have to be thinking like, what's the next thing? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3489.72s)]
*  But yes, I think this one, I have a lot riding on this one, you know, so they, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3494.44s)]
*  they Netflix really wants it to do well. I really want it to do well. And I think if it does well, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3499.72s)]
*  then Netflix will let me make it a handful more. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3505.16s)]
*  That's great. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3509.0s)]
*  Which would be great. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3509.48s)]
*  Yeah, man, we'll make sure. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3510.68s)]
*  Watch it July 7th. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3511.7999999999997s)]
*  We will. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3512.92s)]
*  Yeah, so, yeah, but I have like the next couple ideas cooking right now. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3514.12s)]
*  So as soon as the writers were on strike, so I technically, I can't go pitch a movie right now. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3520.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3526.2s)]
*  So like I have it ready to go. And then as soon as we are not striking any longer, I'll, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3526.52s)]
*  I'll flop on into that movie studio and pitch my wares. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3533.56s)]
*  Do you pitch something before you write it? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3538.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes, you know, sometimes it's, you want to, it depends. Every project's like different, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3541.7999999999997s)]
*  but sometimes if the idea is like too weird that you feel like the executive wouldn't be able to [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3549.88s)]
*  get it, then we wouldn't, we would just write it and then go sell it. But if it's like a hooky idea [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3556.6s)]
*  like this, the outlaws, like when you understand the movie, when I pitch it to you, so you're like, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3564.84s)]
*  oh, I get it. You could just pitch that idea and they'll buy that idea. And then, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3570.2000000000003s)]
*  and then you're kind of on the track already. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3574.92s)]
*  Your show, The Jimstones, are you guys finished doing or you're waiting to see if you do it again? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3578.92s)]
*  I think we'll probably do it again. Danny's pretty confident. He wants to do another [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3583.8s)]
*  couple of seasons of it. It's so fucking fun, dude. And Danny McBride is like, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3588.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm not, you know, like you said earlier, I'm just like so damn lucky to like, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3593.7200000000003s)]
*  that they allow me to keep doing this shit. And it's so ridiculous. Danny McBride is like a true [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3599.1600000000003s)]
*  comedy hero of mine. Like I remember when me and the Workaholics guys, like way before we got [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3606.2000000000003s)]
*  Workaholics, when we were still doing like internet sketch stuff, Ders came over, Anders Holm [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3610.6s)]
*  came over with a DVD. He like knew an agent that slipped him a DVD of The Foot Fist Way. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3618.04s)]
*  Yeah. You ever see that movie? So good, dude. And Jodie Hill directed it. Danny is the star of it. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3624.44s)]
*  Is Jodie right on Jimstones? Yeah, he directs a lot of the episodes. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3632.2s)]
*  Wow. What is he like? He's the best, dude. He's just like the coolest. They're all just the [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3635.08s)]
*  coolest, nicest dudes. And I mean, you get along. So fucking good, dude. When he's trying to break [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3638.76s)]
*  that board. Yeah. He's, I mean, so funny. And we were writing sketches together and we'd write [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3643.88s)]
*  every Wednesday and try to shoot something every weekend. That's what that was like our schedule. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3652.92s)]
*  And so Ders comes over and he's like, we're not going to write anything. We're going to watch this [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3658.2000000000003s)]
*  movie. I heard it's unbelievable. And we're like, all right. And we watched it and we were like, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3661.5600000000004s)]
*  holy shit. And then we watched it right back. We watch it two times in a row. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3666.52s)]
*  And it was the first time that we were like, oh, we can. Not that it wasn't great because it was [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3670.68s)]
*  great, but it was like, they felt like we know those dudes. Like we are, we can make movies like [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3676.52s)]
*  that. Like, you know what I mean? Like, like Will Ferrell, since he does like these big characters [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3681.16s)]
*  and his movies are like big and broad. Can't really do that. Yeah. It felt like unobtainable. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3685.88s)]
*  And so this, it felt like, oh, we can make a movie like this. It feels like down and dirty. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3691.56s)]
*  And like, we could, we could do this like with our friends. And then we started to, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3696.7599999999998s)]
*  that sort of changed our idea of like what we were doing. Cause we were playing like more characters [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3700.68s)]
*  or doing like bits with, with our sketches. And then we're like, we should just play, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3705.72s)]
*  kind of play ourselves. And that's sort of how workaholics like, that was the start of like [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3710.68s)]
*  trying to do sketches where I'm Adam, but like exaggerated version of myself, you know? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3716.44s)]
*  And, and then workaholics was kind of born out of. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3722.52s)]
*  You guys being yourselves just in an, in an environment. In an environment. Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3726.36s)]
*  Yeah. It's kind of the same thing that happened to me for podcasts. And I used to have a podcast [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3730.44s)]
*  with my friend, Matt Weiss, and he worked, works with TMZ. I think he still works with them. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3733.6400000000003s)]
*  And we were interviewing celebrities and stuff and talking about like celebrity stuff. He knew [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3739.48s)]
*  a lot about celebrity stuff. He really liked that world. And it was kind of a struggle for me. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3747.0s)]
*  Cause I didn't know that much about celebrities. And then, then I went on Joe Rogan's show and I [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3752.6800000000003s)]
*  left out of there one day and I was like, Oh, I just need to be, I just need to be myself. I just [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3761.08s)]
*  need to be in a place where I can just talk. Well, I think that's when comics really start [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3767.4s)]
*  to find their rhythm, right? Is when they, when you get over that hump of like, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3771.48s)]
*  like I feel like every comic starts this way where they just, they, they have their top five [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3777.8s)]
*  comics and they try to be like a version of them. Oh yeah. Instead of just doing like what [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3782.92s)]
*  makes you funny. Yeah. Who were some of yours early? I've liked the comics. Or that you, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3788.36s)]
*  you feel like you impersonated anybody a little bit. I know that I remember showing a tape to a [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3794.12s)]
*  guy one time I was doing like a year and he's like, this is great if you're like a Mitch [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3797.88s)]
*  Hedberg impersonator. Very fair. Yeah. I bet I was doing like some Tosh or like trying to be like [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3801.2400000000002s)]
*  Swartz in or, or, um, Jim Gaffigan was, was really big at that time. And I love how he like [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3809.4s)]
*  plays with the levels of his voice, which I still like to do, but, uh, I can see that now. You said [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3817.0s)]
*  a little bit. Yeah. So I'm, so I, yeah, I'm sure there was some of that. And then I think like, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3822.52s)]
*  when you start to find your voices, when you go like, yeah, obviously like Chris Farley is [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3827.48s)]
*  like an influence of mine and Jack Blackson and influence of mine and Sandler, but like, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3832.52s)]
*  what makes me me? And then, and then from then, once I kind of committed to being myself, I feel [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3837.64s)]
*  like everything clicked into place. Yeah. And a lot of that was from watching foot fist way and [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3844.28s)]
*  being like, oh, these guys are just, even though Danny isn't that guy, he's like doing a character, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3849.32s)]
*  but it's like, they're doing a character from a real place that they can access and not, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3853.4s)]
*  you don't have to like on your 30th movie is when you can stretch and, and try to be something that [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3860.92s)]
*  you aren't right. Right. When you could be Tom Hanks, it's like Tom Hanks didn't start off [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=3866.36s)]

*  fucking that, you know? Yeah, you know, it's like you look up piss pig and you're going to see some [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=4398.2s)]

*  and that takes like a few months to get out of your system. And then, and then it's, uh, you know, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5766.28s)]
*  then it's game on. You got a plan, huh? But then even when I'm like, I'm like, there, there can't [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5771.48s)]
*  be too much of a plan because like it's life, baby. It's just going to happen. And then, and then [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5777.24s)]
*  you just have to, then you're going to have like a homie that you like have to take care of. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5782.92s)]

*  without having to take care of a little homie is, uh, you know, cause I've like a lot of my friends, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5795.32s)]
*  they had kids like Blake and honors had kids almost a decade ago now. So they already have like [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5800.44s)]
*  true little people that they take care of that are like playing sports. Wow. You know, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5806.84s)]
*  do you feel behind the curve? No, cause I mean, like, I feel like I also have a whole other group [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5812.360000000001s)]
*  of friends that haven't yet. Yeah. So yeah. And work sometimes keeps you busy, you know? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5818.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. For me, I was like, I wanted to be, uh, set up enough that when I do have kids, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5824.84s)]
*  like I, it's, I don't have to feel like I, uh, like I know what I can pass on and what, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5831.4800000000005s)]
*  there was a point where I was like, I have to be on the road all the time. I have to be doing, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5837.8s)]
*  I have to have a TV show. I have to have a standup show. I have to have, like, I have to do all these [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5842.280000000001s)]
*  things to get to the place that I want to be. And then now I'm like, okay, like I could set up a movie [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5847.4800000000005s)]
*  and I'm confident enough that I'll get another opportunity to come. I don't have to jump on [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5853.64s)]
*  everything. So there will be, I saw I'll have more time to be a good dad. Cause you know, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5858.84s)]
*  that's pretty important. Oh, I think it's going to be key probably. Yeah. Was there, um, yeah, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5864.28s)]
*  I guess it's kind of nice to be, it is nice to be able to say, I don't want, I don't want to do that. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5870.76s)]
*  Yeah. And feel like there, it used to be like, you, you would think like, oh, if I don't do that, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5877.400000000001s)]
*  someone else is going to do that. And then that I would have lost out on that opportunity [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5885.08s)]
*  when now it's like, it's fine. Someone else can do it. Right. It's just not, it just wasn't for me. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5891.16s)]
*  Yeah. Or I don't, I want to have the summer to do X, Y, Z. Like that is more important than this [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5896.2s)]
*  right now. Yeah. And I think like just career wise right now, I feel like I'm in a place where like I [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5901.48s)]
*  can, um, pick and choose a little more than I used to be able to. Congrats, man. It's real cool. Yeah, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5905.72s)]
*  thanks. I mean, you too, you know, I bet it's the same with the podcast world that you've built. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5912.12s)]
*  It's, uh, it's nice to, yeah, I remember when it was taken off for you, for you and I saw you at the, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5916.68s)]
*  um, in the hallway of the improv. And I remember being like, just knowing that your standup was [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5922.599999999999s)]
*  really taking off. And I was like, is it your Netflix special? Like, did your special come out [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5928.12s)]
*  and like kind of blew you up? Cause I think I was gearing up to do my Netflix special and you were [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5932.5199999999995s)]
*  like, no, it was really the podcast. The podcast is what, what it was. Yeah. Yeah. And I just, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5937.96s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's sick. Like I'd seen all you guys, you and you know, Sagura and. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5943.16s)]
*  Yeah. It's a whole world. Yeah. It's interesting to have a whole world, you know? Um, and I think, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5949.16s)]
*  yeah, it's like, it's interesting to have so many different people in here get to, it's interesting [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5954.92s)]
*  that it almost gave everybody else a different Hollywood or a lot of people, a different type [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5959.4800000000005s)]
*  of Hollywood, you know, we just kind of get to communicate, um, get to sit and chat with people [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5963.72s)]
*  too, you know, and catch up. That's fun to talk to some of my heroes. Yeah. It's fun to be able to, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5969.88s)]
*  uh, what I think is cool about podcasts is it's like, it just gives people an opportunity to go [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5974.92s)]
*  like, I wonder what my favorite comics, how they are when they're not, are they funny just off the [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5982.12s)]
*  cuff or do they have to like write everything down? It just gives them a opportunity to peek [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5988.4400000000005s)]
*  behind the curtain of like, what is kind of like to sit in the back of a comedy club with, you know, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5993.4s)]
*  with comedian peers. Yeah. You know, and it's not like we would sit down and have like an hour long [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=5999.0s)]
*  conversation in the back of a comedy club because you got to do your set, but it's like, it gives [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6004.92s)]
*  people a little peek. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting, man. It's interesting to see, uh, it's interesting [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6008.92s)]
*  here. I like listening to some pods and I'm like, oh wow, this is, this is good. You know, I mean, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6014.599999999999s)]
*  it's just, it's, it's nice to be able to talk about things. It's nice to be able to see where [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6018.5199999999995s)]
*  somebody's career is at, how some things have kind of happened for them. People's lives get so busy [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6022.12s)]
*  too. I've started to realize that sometimes when I sit down with someone to podcast, it may be the [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6026.44s)]
*  only time I'm going to get to talk to them for a while. So to make, you know, to sort of really try [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6030.599999999999s)]
*  and make the time have some value, uh, not only to listeners, but you know, just, just like between [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6034.5199999999995s)]
*  me and them. Um, what's like, uh, you know, there's like some meme going around of like, I don't know, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6041.16s)]
*  of like showing like kids playing. And then it's like, at some point, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6048.92s)]
*  you're going to go out and play with your friends and that'll be the last time you played with your [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6054.759999999999s)]
*  friends in your childhood. And you're like, oh yeah. And it's sort of the same with like comics [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6059.16s)]
*  where we all kind of were in the same circles when we were starting out at the comedy store, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6064.5199999999995s)]
*  at the improv, the laugh factor, wherever. Uh, and you just see the same people over and over and over [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6070.679999999999s)]
*  and over again. And then all of a sudden something happens in someone's career and it takes them this [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6076.12s)]
*  way or that way. And then you no longer see those people. Cause it's probably been years since I've [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6081.400000000001s)]
*  seen you. So like it's, it's cool for the podcast world to be able to sit down with people that you [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6085.96s)]
*  respect and like, and, uh, and have conversations with them and get to catch up with, with people [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6093.08s)]
*  that, uh, you always liked, even if you only ever saw them for 15 minutes in the back of comedy [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6099.24s)]
*  clubs once a week. Yeah. Um, I don't know what to say after that. Zach, do we have any other good [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6104.6s)]
*  news? Was there anything else that we were looking at in the news that was interesting? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6112.200000000001s)]
*  Um, yeah, well, uh, so it looks, they just tweeted this photo last night of Elon Musk is training for [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6116.200000000001s)]
*  his fight with Mark Zuckerberg. I guess with Lex Friedman. That's awesome that he's training. I love it. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6122.360000000001s)]
*  And I really want to see this fight because it will be entertaining regardless of how good of [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6127.96s)]
*  a fight it is. Uh, I thought I read something about how Elon Musk's mom doesn't want him to [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6133.88s)]
*  fight and came out and said, like the fight is canceled. Wow. But maybe that's fake news. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6142.2s)]
*  I don't know. I have no idea. Um, yeah, I mean, it's hard to know these days. What is news? What [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6148.92s)]
*  is being used as like a ploy to push something? Um, I think that they'll encourage this match. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6153.32s)]
*  My a Musk. Okay. Wow. Well, I think she must know that Elon, I think they say that Zuckerberg [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6161.96s)]
*  can actually. Will you see Mark Zuckerberg? He's a lot younger than Elon, right? He's only five, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6172.6s)]
*  seven. Now he wants five, 10 or 11. I don't know the weight difference, but if you have a guy that's [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6181.4800000000005s)]
*  really strong, that's small. I think he's going to defeat a guy that's weaker. That's big. Well, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6186.76s)]
*  and also Elon isn't known for being like a fighter at all. And I feel like, no, I feel [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6190.28s)]
*  Mark like trains. He trains. He trains. He's like, he's like in the Jeff Bezos camp of like, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6198.5199999999995s)]
*  he got rich and then now he just eats space food and treats his body like a temple. Yeah. I mean, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6206.2s)]
*  Mark hasn't blinked probably since 91 or 92. Yeah. I think he had the surgery. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6212.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you can see that he's writing an algorithm with his fucking eyes, bro. Yeah, dude. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6218.6s)]
*  He is human AI right there. It totally is. There's no doubt about it. He very much has an AI look [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6224.84s)]
*  and Elon looks, I think, I just don't, I don't know how Elon wins, but if Elon is low key, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6230.68s)]
*  I mean, he didn't even look at, he's holding his boxing gloves correctly. If you look at the [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6238.44s)]
*  boxing gloves picture. Yeah. Yeah. He's not chin is way out there, buddy. Yeah. That's a great point. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6241.16s)]
*  Even just right there. Yeah. And also the age difference. That is something. Oh, that'll wear [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6246.52s)]
*  you. Oh, yeah. But Elon has a gas hangstamp all night and tweet me. I'll tweet it. Freaking. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6253.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. He's got gas in the tank. So maybe I'm excited to see it. He's also [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6260.360000000001s)]
*  a lot heavier. True. So, you know, it's a good point. You just lay on top of him. You might win. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6265.64s)]
*  It's a good point. Yeah. I think it's just getting interesting in the world. This is the type of [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6271.96s)]
*  stuff you're starting to see. And we talked about this years ago about everything becoming WWE, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6275.24s)]
*  you know, everything becoming matches. It's like you have, you know, Jake Paul and Nate Diaz are [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6279.5599999999995s)]
*  going to fight, you know, you have potentially, I mean, this has potential, you know, like Dana [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6285.48s)]
*  White wouldn't waste his time on the communicating with these guys. No, I mean, I would, I want to [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6290.12s)]
*  see it like it is, it is weird. It sort of feels like the hunger games or some shit like, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6295.24s)]
*  where like they used to make movies or like in a world where, yeah, where the two richest men in [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6302.52s)]
*  the world just duke it out. It feels fake, you know, and it feels it's so weird now that like, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6308.04s)]
*  like if me and you wanted to just fight there, we could fight and then we could like be at [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6315.96s)]
*  Staples Center fighting when it used to be like, you used to have to be a fighter. You would like [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6322.52s)]
*  have to go through training for it. It'd just be like me and you were like similarly built. It'd [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6328.68s)]
*  be like, yeah, Theo's got the reach, but Adam can get inside and then, and then we could be at [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6335.320000000001s)]
*  least on an undercard. Yeah, we could be on an undercard. We could be on an undercard for [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6341.72s)]

*  other. Neither of us really wants to throw a punch. You break into, I hit you once you break in a song. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6397.56s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I spin off. And then who else is on that card? Who's under us? You said bangerang. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6402.6s)]
*  What if you went like old, like a Rufio type of like, oh, versus Emmanuel Lewis, maybe. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6409.8s)]
*  Was Emmanuel Lewis dead? But hey, look. Don't want to put that out there if he's not. Sorry. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6416.52s)]
*  Whoever brought Pink's mom to the show though can throw on stage. Yeah. That's his promoter. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6422.280000000001s)]
*  So no, 52. All right. Versus Rufio. So if you had them two and we need a good female bout on the card [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6427.32s)]
*  too. Yes, absolutely. Uh, Jane Lynch, Amy Schumer. Oh, I like that. That's fun. Jane's a little older, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6436.12s)]
*  but she's, she's a tall woman. She's longer longer. And she can, she looks like she could go through a [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6448.84s)]
*  fucking, like, yeah, she could run through a wall. That lady. Oh, she looks like the, like a wind [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6454.68s)]
*  chime that'll beat the fuck out of some music. That is exactly what she looks like. That was a perfect [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6459.320000000001s)]
*  description of Jane Lynch. Um, it'd be fun, man. Um, what else? Anything else, Zach? Or do you think [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6465.0s)]
*  we covered a lot of neat stuff? Did we cover neat stuff, Zach? I think we covered some neat stuff. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6472.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Learned about piss pigs. That was informative. That's so heartbreaking. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6476.52s)]
*  Yeah. We couldn't really look it up because it is pretty pornographic. Thank God. And I have the [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6480.36s)]
*  blockers too on my phone and computer. Um, but the movie is July 7th. That's right. July 7th, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6485.88s)]
*  the outlaws. We want to go watch it. And what do, what do consumers need to think about when they go [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6493.32s)]
*  watch stuff like, and how it affects what other movies are going to be created? Because I feel [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6498.12s)]
*  like that's starting to become like, it's always been a thing, but with only so many comedies being [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6502.76s)]
*  created last year, that's unbelievable. It sucks, dude. It sucks. Uh, and luckily like Netflix is [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6508.36s)]
*  one of the places that is just willing to roll the dice a little more than, than other places [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6514.76s)]
*  because it matters so much less. Like, like, like the machine and Sebastian's movie, um, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6519.0s)]
*  about my father, I think, uh, the fact that they put both of those movies out on the same weekend, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6525.96s)]
*  I'm like, that fucking sucks. Cause like you're putting out six movies all year long [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6532.2s)]
*  and then you put two of them out on the same weekend. And so like, if you're going to go see [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6537.64s)]
*  a comedy, you had to choose between these two. And then when those movies only make $8 million [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6541.08s)]
*  or whatever opening weekend, well, you're like, well, if it was only the one movie, maybe it could [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6545.4s)]
*  have made 14, could have made, yeah, 15, 16. And then that's a healthy amount for it to make. But [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6549.32s)]
*  right. Yeah. So, uh, it's like, yeah, support. If you like comedy, support comedies, watch it, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6554.92s)]
*  tell your friends to watch it. Um, and then, and then we'll have the opportunity to make more of [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6561.8s)]
*  them. And, and it used to be, you know, well, people are like, well, if you made better comedies [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6566.68s)]
*  than inside. Sure. But it's hard to make a movie. First of all, it's really hard. And secondly, uh, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6570.92s)]
*  there used to be like 40 shots and making a good comedy. And then maybe two or three of them were [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6577.320000000001s)]
*  a classic comedy. And you're like, well, that old school and it came out and you're like, well, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6583.320000000001s)]
*  there was 28 other movies that weren't old school that came out that year. You know what I mean? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6589.56s)]
*  Right. So the more opportunities we have to make classic comedies, the more we'll be able to, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6593.96s)]
*  to nail it. But I do think outlaws, uh, has a potential to be one of those type of movies. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6600.44s)]
*  So I'm really proud of it. Do you think of, um, do you start to think of creating a movie [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6605.88s)]
*  entirely of your own? Like you are partnering with somebody and using your, like D or in doing it [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6612.04s)]
*  direct to consumer. Does that ever start to become a, a discussable model? Maybe not in your space. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6616.76s)]
*  I mean, you're kind of a, yeah, just cause it's the movies I want to make are usually like action [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6621.8s)]
*  comedies and they are, you need money. I need money. Like I don't have $30 million of my own [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6628.4400000000005s)]
*  money to invest in the movie. Right. Uh, so you got it. You got a partner. You need a big deal. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6634.84s)]
*  Yeah. And you need a partner. And then also like it costs a lot to promote a movie too. Like that's [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6641.16s)]
*  where people forget, like buying TV commercials to play during basketball games and like things [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6645.56s)]
*  that people are actually watching live. I cost some fortune and to put billboards up and to have, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6651.88s)]
*  you know, radio commercials and like to get the word out there. Like I don't, I don't have that [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6657.400000000001s)]
*  infrastructure. So like workaholics movie, we were going to do a workaholics movie and we were five [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6661.56s)]
*  weeks out from shooting. You'd already written it already written it. We're in pre-production had [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6666.4400000000005s)]
*  offices, we're building sets, had the whole cast and crew coming back and we're going to shoot it [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6671.16s)]
*  here in LA. Uh, and then at the top of this year, Paramount plus said it didn't, they like [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6676.28s)]
*  went off on like, uh, you know, the holiday break. And when they came back, they were like, you know [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6683.48s)]
*  what, we have a new global agenda and we don't feel that workaholics fits the global agenda. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6688.2s)]
*  And they pulled the plug from us and everyone's like, just make the movie on your own. It was [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6693.639999999999s)]
*  like, we don't have that much money to, you know, we're not billionaires. We like, we don't have [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6697.88s)]
*  that kind of coin. So like now it's just, and they own the rights to it too. So we couldn't even [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6702.76s)]
*  anyways. So yeah, we just, all that, all that work for, for nothing. How did, and that, I mean, that [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6708.92s)]
*  just goes to show you how hard it is, why people don't, I can't imagine that movie. I can't imagine [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6714.4400000000005s)]
*  that not getting made. I can't imagine if you're going to find a brand that people love, that that [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6720.52s)]
*  would not, that they would not think that that would have an audience. It was so heartbreaking [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6727.64s)]
*  because it was, uh, I did get to write a really funny press release though, about just, I said [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6731.96s)]
*  butthurt like 15 times in the, how butthurt I am that they pulled the block, which I'm, I'm, it was [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6737.72s)]
*  funny to see like a variety and the Hollywood reporters saying Adam Devine says he's very [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6743.0s)]
*  butthurt that the Paramount Plus canceled the workaholics movie. But, uh, they, they like were [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6748.76s)]
*  gassing us up. They're like, this is the home for workaholics. We want to build out the workaholics [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6755.08s)]
*  universe. And they're like, we want to do like a spin-off show that you guys executive produce. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6760.5199999999995s)]
*  Maybe we do an animated project. We'll do the movie. Like we want your brand of comedy to live [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6766.68s)]
*  on Paramount Plus. And we're like, thank God, like we have a home base that we could just go to. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6773.16s)]
*  We can make all of our stuff there. We can, people love it. We can keep the workaholics [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6779.72s)]
*  family alive. Like so many friends and, and you know, people that worked on the show that, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6785.24s)]
*  that would like, that was going to be their opportunity. And then they just pulled the [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6791.48s)]
*  rug out from us. So super butthurt about it. But, um, anything else? Is that anything? That's unreal, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6794.839999999999s)]
*  man. Yeah. That just shows you how hard it is to get something past. I just like, it's like, do [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6805.719999999999s)]
*  people not, it's almost like if it doesn't have global power, if they don't think it can sell, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6810.68s)]
*  if it can sell tickets to everywhere. Well, see that, that was, that was weird is like, I've been [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6814.76s)]
*  in the Amazon jungle. I've been up the Amazon and we stayed in a little hut and the guy who, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6820.280000000001s)]
*  uh, was like in charge of feeding us, his teenage son knew workaholics was a fan. I've been in Germany [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6829.240000000001s)]
*  just like walking along the Berlin wall and people are stopping me saying they'd love [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6836.92s)]
*  workaholics. I'm like, it was pretty global. Yeah. Like as far as a, you know, kind of a [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6842.6s)]
*  cult comedy show goes, I'm like, it wasn't like it was, it wasn't like a hundred million dollar [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6848.28s)]
*  Marvel movie. Yeah. So I don't get it. But, you know, I feel like they're really trying to figure [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6853.96s)]
*  out what they're doing over there at Paramount Plus and they, they have not fully figured it out. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6858.04s)]
*  It's so, it's so, it's so, it feels so weird to know is how people who are making the choices don't, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6862.280000000001s)]
*  don't have a real understanding of what's going on or what they, or what the zeitgeist of like [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6868.6s)]
*  people think is funny is. Yeah. Well, I think it was like, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6873.16s)]
*  cause Comedy Central hit and it was people of a certain age, right? That really loved it. That [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6877.56s)]
*  they were like, just got out of college or were still in high school or like maybe even a little [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6882.52s)]
*  bit older than that, that were like, oh yeah, that was just like me when I was in college or [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6888.52s)]
*  kids that were younger that were like, oh wow, that seems crazy. Yeah. Like when I have my first [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6892.92s)]
*  jobs, I hope me and my friends to live with each other and party and party all the time. And then [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6899.320000000001s)]
*  I think like they're like people who had kids that were the right age know about workaholics [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6904.280000000001s)]
*  because they're like, oh my, my teenage sons loved workaholics. And I think it was just like the [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6911.56s)]
*  generation, the kid, the guys that are in charge now didn't have their kids were too young. So they [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6916.68s)]
*  didn't know. And I think it was just, we missed that window. I think. What a fuck hat. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6922.280000000001s)]
*  That's all right. Things are going well. Yeah. Things are going well. But it is interesting to [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6929.400000000001s)]
*  hear about that. Dude, the other night after a show, this guy, this Mexican kid, uh, this guy at the [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6933.08s)]
*  show, he's a Mexican guy. He comes up and he's like, this is the craziest request ever. He goes, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6937.96s)]
*  Hey bro, can you make a video for my cousin Oscar? And I was like, yeah, man, what do you want me to [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6941.64s)]
*  say? And he's like, oh, he got possessed by ghosts. That's what he said. Right. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6946.84s)]
*  oh, he got possessed by ghosts, man. So just fucking telling something positive. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6953.4800000000005s)]
*  So just try to, um, exercise his demons. Yeah. I was like, uh, Oscar, homie, we miss you, homie. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6959.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, come back to the light. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6968.04s)]
*  But that was probably one of the craziest requests that I've gotten from somebody. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6973.8s)]
*  Oh dude, in Germany, one time we're biking on the thing. We're biking somewhere. Some guys in a park [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6979.64s)]
*  had a wiener on them. I mean, a real fucking, um, like a Datsun, you know what I'm saying? He had [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6985.32s)]
*  that fucking, that thing would go get the paper. Yeah. The long, long thick. Yeah. He really had [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6991.72s)]
*  fucking, I don't know how he did it, but somebody, he did it. And, uh, he was swinging it like a rope [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=6996.6s)]
*  in the fucking park as you have to. If you got a thing like that, you got to swing it. That's true. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=7002.84s)]
*  Yeah. And it's also Germany. They don't even care. That's just an afternoon there. Right. We were [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh5J5cuDEa4&t=7008.52s)]
