*  I've personally been thinking a lot about meaning [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=105.72s)]
*  and what just meaning of life, meaning of self, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=108.28s)]
*  things like that, you know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=114.12s)]

*  Yeah, it's really exciting, man. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=168.52s)]
*  A lot of my friends have been turned on to you [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=170.36s)]
*  and just like your ability to like share your thoughts [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=172.88s)]
*  like in a concise and informative enough way [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  where I guess people are able to absorb them [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=180.84s)]
*  and they don't sound too monotonous [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  where it sounds too much like you're studying kind of. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=187.56s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=188.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, I really, well, I really believe in, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=189.22s)]
*  I don't just believe, I really believe in the work [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=194.28s)]
*  that I'm doing, it's like it's a calling for me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  And so, and it's something that I live. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=199.72s)]
*  And I, part of, I mean, I've been a teacher [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=203.24s)]
*  for a very long time and I think part of being [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=206.64s)]
*  a good teacher is to always be yourself learning. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=209.84s)]
*  And so I try to teach by sharing the enthusiasm [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  of the learning I'm going through. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=216.32s)]
*  Like even when I'm doing a lecture, I'll learn, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  something will come up and that moment will jazz me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=220.24s)]
*  And that's the style I've tried to develop [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  and it seems to work, at least for the material [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=226.68s)]
*  I've been privileged to get to teach. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=229.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and you teach all, I guess, I mean, a lot of people, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=232.4s)]
*  like I guess a lot of things that I get shared [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=234.36s)]
*  about yours are about meaning and looking into meaning. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=236.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=239.8s)]
*  And especially at a time where it feels like people are, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=240.62s)]
*  for me even, I mean, it feels like we're getting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=245.96s)]
*  into this cul-de-sac in America where it's like, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  is there a lot of value to my life? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=251.82s)]
*  Do I, am I just a cog in the wheel? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=254.22s)]
*  Am I just a consumer? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=256.78s)]
*  Is there any, what is the purpose for me? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=258.82s)]
*  I think a lot of people are starting [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=262.82s)]
*  to ask themselves that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=263.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=265.18s)]
*  I call that the meaning crisis and I think there's good [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=266.26s)]
*  evidence that it's becoming very prevalent in the West, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=271.76s)]
*  whatever that means these days, but sort of North America, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=276.46s)]
*  Europe, Japan. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=279.94s)]
*  Hawaii. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=283.06s)]
*  Yeah, Australia, things like that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=283.9s)]
*  And the symptoms are, you can sort of see symptoms of it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=287.34s)]
*  all through the culture. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=292.06s)]
*  And I've also seen a significant increase [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=294.66s)]
*  in the work I'm doing, both academically [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=300.46s)]
*  and in the public sphere, especially since COVID. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=303.3s)]
*  COVID really ramped a lot of these issues up for people [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=307.34s)]
*  in a powerful way. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=310.61999999999995s)]
*  What the issues of like questioning themselves, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=312.85999999999996s)]
*  what's going on? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=315.61999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so the thing, one of the interesting things [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=316.7s)]
*  that COVID did is it threw people back onto their inner life. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  And what's interesting is our culture, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=325.38s)]
*  especially North American culture, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=327.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm not the first to observe it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  It has a hyperponderance of a tendency towards narcissism [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  being very, like, you know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=335.46s)]
*  So people have oriented their lives [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=337.41999999999996s)]
*  in a very self-centered way, but they thought that, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  Or they can maybe, a better way of putting it, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=344.46s)]
*  they confuse that with having deep, rich inner resources. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  And when everything sort of stopped [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=351.38s)]
*  and they couldn't focus the world on them [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=354.06s)]
*  and they had to focus on themselves [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  in order to find resources, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=357.94s)]
*  and what you found was a bifurcation, like a division. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=359.94s)]
*  Some people were like, whoa, that really threw them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=363.5s)]
*  So I'll say something to you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=368.42s)]
*  And I'm of two minds of it [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=370.9s)]
*  because I'm happy about it as a scientist [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=373.06s)]
*  because I made a prediction [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=374.7s)]
*  and I'm sad about it as a human being [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=375.9s)]
*  because it's not a good prediction. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=377.78s)]
*  So just as the pandemic was hitting, I said, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=379.9s)]
*  what you're gonna get is you're gonna get a rise [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=383.14s)]
*  in a term that Julian Evans made famous [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=385.78s)]
*  called conspirituality. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=388.66s)]
*  This mixture of conspiracy theories and spirituality, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=390.06s)]
*  and that took off. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=393.74s)]
*  And then I said, as we come out of the pandemic, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=394.58s)]
*  we'll get a mental health spike. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=397.06s)]
*  And then a little bit later, sort of an increase in crime. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=398.7s)]
*  And all of these things are coming to pass [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=401.5s)]
*  because what had happened is many people [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=403.94s)]
*  are thrown into the interior life only to realize [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=405.94s)]
*  for all of the self-centeredness, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=409.1s)]
*  they've actually not given any wise attention [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=411.74s)]
*  to their inner life. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=414.02s)]
*  And they were suddenly without resources. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=415.78s)]
*  Other people saw this as an opportunity [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=417.98s)]
*  and they framed it that way. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=422.94s)]
*  And so what's been springing up [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  where all of these online communities, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=426.1s)]
*  where people, not to sound too highfalutin or anything, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  but people started to say, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  I know I really wanna cultivate wisdom. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's tons of information. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=436.94s)]
*  There's a lot of bullshit mixed up with it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  There's all this stuff and then there's science and that, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=440.1s)]
*  but I want wisdom. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=442.94s)]
*  And so, and I get, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  I've gotten involved with quite a few of these communities. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=446.22s)]
*  So that was, there's both, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=448.42s)]
*  you have both negative and positive symptoms in the culture. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  Like, the number of close friends people have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=455.46s)]
*  is reliably declining, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=458.66s)]
*  even for all of our social internet connections. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  Loneliness is becoming epidemic. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=464.42s)]
*  And loneliness is, it's very unhealthy. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=467.18s)]
*  We are naturally social cultural beings [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=470.14s)]
*  and loneliness is- [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's becoming a hobby too for some people in a way. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=476.9s)]
*  It's becoming almost so common that it's like, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=479.46s)]
*  or not common, but it's, well, I guess common, I guess. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=484.14s)]
*  And once you start to become something, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=487.38s)]
*  there's a part of you that will wanna find [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=489.82s)]
*  the most organized way to be it and to engage in it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=491.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=494.38s)]
*  So even in loneliness, it's almost becoming a culture. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  It is, but it's a culture with great cost. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=498.14s)]
*  I mean, we have weird things happening. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=501.38s)]
*  The UK has set up a Ministry of Loneliness, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=504.1s)]
*  which sounds like something out of Orwell, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=506.86s)]
*  Like the Ministry of Loneliness. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=508.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=509.94s)]
*  And it's like, whoa, how did we get there? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like an Ozzy Osbourne album. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=512.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=514.46s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=515.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=516.3s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder how he would say that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=519.34s)]
*  Ministry of Loneliness. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=520.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=522.0600000000001s)]
*  Sharon! [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=524.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=525.14s)]
*  He probably would get one of his kids, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=525.98s)]
*  I don't even know if he can talk anymore. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=528.14s)]
*  But yeah, well, so to go back to the past, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=530.14s)]
*  you're looking at, so when you look at, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=534.4599999999999s)]
*  so COVID, you're saying was an opportunity [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=537.02s)]
*  or caused a lot of us to like, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=540.0999999999999s)]
*  inter-flect. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=542.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=543.8199999999999s)]
*  Or like look inside of ourselves. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=544.66s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=545.5s)]
*  Okay, and some people did it like in a healthy way, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=546.3399999999999s)]
*  where they kind of looked inside of themselves [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=549.3s)]
*  and were like, wow, I haven't looked in here in a while. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=550.9s)]
*  I'm gonna find ways to challenge myself [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=552.98s)]
*  and see what's going on here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=554.86s)]
*  I'm gonna join other groups and people [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=556.38s)]
*  that are curious about their inner self [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=559.4599999999999s)]
*  and then the other group, what happened? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=564.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, a lot of them sort of fell into [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=567.46s)]
*  the things that were already at work in the culture. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=572.14s)]
*  The meaning crisis predates COVID by like centuries. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=574.78s)]
*  But you saw a rise in mental health issues. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=579.14s)]
*  So depression and anxiety have gone up [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=584.22s)]
*  and they have continued to increase. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=586.02s)]
*  And this is quite independent of how affluent, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=588.5s)]
*  so Silicon Valley has a tremendous problem [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=593.5s)]
*  with depression and anxiety. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=595.82s)]
*  Here are the people who are supposed to be [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=596.86s)]
*  at the pinnacle of our society. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=598.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=600.42s)]
*  We idolize them, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=601.38s)]
*  And yet their kids are in trouble [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=602.54s)]
*  and they're in trouble in certain ways. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=606.26s)]
*  Have we always throughout time, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=608.3s)]
*  have people always searched for meaning in their life? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=609.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=612.34s)]
*  Has it always been like, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=613.18s)]
*  are we at like a, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=614.78s)]
*  because you're saying that COVID kind of put us [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=616.9399999999999s)]
*  in this place where it kind of put us in a fast forward [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=619.02s)]
*  of people really gonna start to look at that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  because the fabric of society kind of stopped and paused [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=624.86s)]
*  and so you're left with yourself really. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=629.06s)]
*  But people have always looked for meaning? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=631.9s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=633.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, so in the series I did and in the book on zombies, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=634.78s)]
*  the book is the idea that zombies are a myth that arose [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=640.1s)]
*  to try and give people an image of the meaninglessness [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=643.9s)]
*  in their lives. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=647.62s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=648.4599999999999s)]
*  But we talked about two kinds of issues. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=649.6999999999999s)]
*  One are what we call like perennial problems. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=652.22s)]
*  Like you said, there's issues that human beings [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=654.54s)]
*  always have confronted and we can get into [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=656.54s)]
*  why that might be the case. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=658.86s)]
*  And then there's also historical factors [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=660.54s)]
*  that have been growing since the late middle ages [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=663.4599999999999s)]
*  and accelerating and things have, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  there's been a lot of major things [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=669.22s)]
*  that are accelerants on those historical forces. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=672.26s)]
*  And what happens is the historical forces sort of undermine [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=675.62s)]
*  like you said, the cultural fabric that normally helps people [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  to address the perennial problems. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=685.1s)]
*  And then what happens is you get a vicious cycle. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  The perennial problems get worse. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=688.82s)]
*  The social fabric tears more. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=690.82s)]
*  The perennial problems get, and you start to spiral. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=692.5400000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=694.74s)]
*  And that's where it feels like kind of like we're at. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=695.58s)]
*  Yes, yes, that's amazing. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=697.34s)]
*  So when I, I didn't, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=700.98s)]
*  how the Awakening from the Meaning Crisis came up [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=705.14s)]
*  was actually a former student of mine took a class with me [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=707.3000000000001s)]
*  and said you should turn this into a YouTube series. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=709.5s)]
*  And the Awakening from the Meaning Crisis [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=711.38s)]
*  is your YouTube series, right? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=712.74s)]
*  Yeah, I have two major YouTube series. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=713.86s)]
*  I have Awakening from the Meaning Crisis, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=715.46s)]
*  which is about what we're talking about. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=717.02s)]
*  And then there's After Socrates, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=718.54s)]
*  which is an attempt to do an in-depth reconstruction, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=720.74s)]
*  reverse engineering of a Socratic way of life [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=725.7s)]
*  as a way of cultivating wisdom, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=731.94s)]
*  both individually and collectively. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=733.34s)]
*  What does that mean, a Socratic way of life? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=735.1800000000001s)]
*  We're not gonna know what that means. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=736.82s)]
*  Right, so the unexamined life is worth living. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=738.46s)]
*  So this is a Socratic quote. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=741.58s)]
*  He says this at his trial, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=742.98s)]
*  and they basically say to him, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=746.1800000000001s)]
*  stop doing philosophy, we'll let you go. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=748.78s)]
*  And he said, or if not, we'll kill you, right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=751.26s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=755.4200000000001s)]
*  And he says, well, the unexamined life is not worth living. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=756.26s)]
*  I'd rather die. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=760.0600000000001s)]
*  And so Socrates is very, very interesting. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=761.9s)]
*  He has two sort of influences. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=766.94s)]
*  One influence, he's influenced by the first scientists [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=769.58s)]
*  that are emerging in ancient Greece. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=772.78s)]
*  He takes a look at the natural science, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=774.7s)]
*  and it's a breakthrough, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=776.22s)]
*  like as opposed to a mythological way of thinking. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=777.86s)]
*  These early thinkers are using observation and reason [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=780.1s)]
*  to try and understand the world. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=782.4200000000001s)]
*  He thinks that's powerful, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=783.7s)]
*  but he finds that the science, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=785.5400000000001s)]
*  and this is relevant for us, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=787.0600000000001s)]
*  he finds that the scientific information [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=788.62s)]
*  isn't existentially relevant. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=790.82s)]
*  It doesn't lead to personal transformation. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=792.4200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't tell him how to become a better person. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=794.0600000000001s)]
*  So it gives him a lot of information, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=796.34s)]
*  and it makes him understand things, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=797.94s)]
*  but it's not helping him as a person, in his soul. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=799.78s)]
*  And you see, that's how a lot of people feel [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=803.1s)]
*  about our scientific worldview. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=805.74s)]
*  We have a scientific worldview that explains everything, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=807.5s)]
*  except how we generate science, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=809.9s)]
*  and how we should live meaningful lives [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=812.14s)]
*  within that worldview. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=815.18s)]
*  So Socrates says, that's not good enough. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=816.22s)]
*  The truth-seeking is good, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  but it's not giving me any relevance. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=819.22s)]
*  And then there's the sophists, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=822.02s)]
*  and that literally means sort of the wise guys. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=823.26s)]
*  And these are the people that invent rhetoric, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=825.9s)]
*  the first sort of, first good use of bullshit, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=828.22s)]
*  in a technical sense, in Harry Frankfurt's sense. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=832.22s)]
*  The liar tries to manipulate you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=835.62s)]
*  because you care about the truth, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=837.9s)]
*  and they try to convince you that something is truth. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=839.02s)]
*  But the bullshit artist does something different. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=841.42s)]
*  They try to get you unconcerned [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=843.14s)]
*  about whether or not something is the truth, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=844.74s)]
*  and just caught up in how catchy it is. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=846.5s)]
*  Advertising, all advertising works this way. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=848.98s)]
*  You watch the alcohol commercial, right? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=851.26s)]
*  Here's a bar, and somebody gets a drink, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=854.46s)]
*  and there's gorgeous people, and happy music, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=856.5s)]
*  and everybody's well-dressed and smiling. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=858.86s)]
*  Go into a bar, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=860.66s)]
*  That's not, and we all know it's false. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=861.74s)]
*  It's not the same in there. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=863.86s)]
*  No, but it's catchy. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=865.26s)]
*  It triggers all kinds, you know, sexuality, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=869.1s)]
*  and vibrancy, and sociality. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=871.98s)]
*  Yeah, possibility. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=874.14s)]
*  Yeah, and all that, and so it gets very catchy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=875.3000000000001s)]
*  And you don't care about the truth, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=877.5s)]
*  and you get caught up in how catchy it is. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=879.34s)]
*  And this is what the sophists discovered. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=881.62s)]
*  They knew, they learned how to make things catchy, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=883.9s)]
*  so they would really go deep into people and change them. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=887.1s)]
*  Now, they did it in a manipulative fashion. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=890.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, Socrates said, well, they're the opposite. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=892.34s)]
*  They're giving me lots of relevance, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=895.74s)]
*  transformative power, but no truth. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=897.18s)]
*  And what he did is basically said, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=899.14s)]
*  I want the two together. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=900.8199999999999s)]
*  I want transformative truths. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=902.1s)]
*  I wanna go on a quest to find those truths that catch. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=903.54s)]
*  Wow, he was like a gangster, huh? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=910.34s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, he's a hero to me. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=913.26s)]
*  Yeah, well, it sounds like, that's what I'm saying. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=915.5s)]
*  It sounds like he was like a John Wayne of like, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=917.18s)]
*  we're gonna do this a new way, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=920.26s)]
*  and this is the way that it needs to be. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=922.62s)]
*  He was a real pioneer, kind of. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=925.58s)]
*  He is, I mean, it's called the Socratic Revolution. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=926.82s)]
*  I mean, he's an astonishing individual. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=929.1s)]
*  He was extremely brave. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=932.1s)]
*  He had a reputation, like he was a soldier. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=933.86s)]
*  And at several times in battle, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=936.98s)]
*  he showed tremendous courage and presence of mind [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=939.34s)]
*  when everybody else is panicking. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=942.22s)]
*  He could stand in one place, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=944.14s)]
*  like in profound meditation for like 24, 48 hours. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=948.58s)]
*  He was, his life was threatened several times, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=953.98s)]
*  and he never sort of capitulated to the forces. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=958.1800000000001s)]
*  He was brave. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=963.62s)]
*  He's brave. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=964.58s)]
*  I mean, he- [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=968.14s)]
*  Creative, it sounds like. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=969.38s)]
*  Yeah, and he invented this way of interacting with people. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=970.74s)]
*  He would ask them questions, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=976.34s)]
*  and he would try and draw out, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=978.38s)]
*  like he compared himself to a midwife. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=982.14s)]
*  I help people to give birth to themselves. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=985.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=987.78s)]
*  And so he wasn't, like he would often show people [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=988.62s)]
*  that their claims to being wise or to knowledge [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=992.38s)]
*  didn't work. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=998.38s)]
*  He would get them into this state. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=999.22s)]
*  The people said it was like being stung by a sting ray [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1000.06s)]
*  or a spell cast on you. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1004.58s)]
*  You'd get into this state. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1005.78s)]
*  And he did this for a particular reason. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1007.22s)]
*  So the Athenians had oracles, like the oracle at Delphi. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1008.82s)]
*  Have you ever been to Delphi? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1012.58s)]
*  I know. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1013.58s)]
*  Oh, I don't think so I have. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1014.4200000000001s)]
*  Is it? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1015.5400000000001s)]
*  Nope, I haven't. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1017.2600000000001s)]
*  It puts the zap on you, man. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1018.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1019.98s)]
*  Like you stand in front of the Omphalus, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1020.82s)]
*  the navel of the world, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1022.58s)]
*  and this chasm drops away in front of you, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1023.7s)]
*  and this mountain goes up, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1027.98s)]
*  and this woman, she would sit in a cave, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  and there's some speculation [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1031.7s)]
*  that she was getting intoxicated, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1033.38s)]
*  and then she would speak, answer people's questions. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1034.9s)]
*  Now when you're an oracle, right, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1038.46s)]
*  if you wanna stay in business as an oracle, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1039.66s)]
*  you don't give really clear answers to people, right? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1041.14s)]
*  Right, because you need them to come back. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1043.9s)]
*  You need them to come back. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1045.22s)]
*  So you know, should I marry Cassandra? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1046.14s)]
*  Well, sometimes the squirrels don't gather nuts. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1048.82s)]
*  Okay, what is it? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1051.8600000000001s)]
*  So a friend of Socrates went to the oracle, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1053.18s)]
*  and I have no basis for saying that, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1058.82s)]
*  but I always picture them sort of smirking [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1061.46s)]
*  and nudging each other. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1064.08s)]
*  We're gonna ask this really cool question, right? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1065.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1067.5s)]
*  You ready? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1068.34s)]
*  And so she goes up, and they go up, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1069.18s)]
*  and they say to her, is there anyone wiser than Socrates? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1070.02s)]
*  And they're expecting this really cryptic, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1075.3s)]
*  and she said, no, no human being is wiser than Socrates. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1078.26s)]
*  Straight answer. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1081.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1082.78s)]
*  So she went back, so he went back, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1084.14s)]
*  and they tell Socrates, no, you and I, we're honest, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1086.42s)]
*  if they said, we got that message from the gods, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1089.38s)]
*  we go, yeah, yeah, I always knew it, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1091.98s)]
*  I always knew it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1093.66s)]
*  He does this other thing, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1094.74s)]
*  and this tells you how Socratic he is. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1096.46s)]
*  He says, well, the gods can't lie. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1098.0200000000002s)]
*  By the way, that's one way, and he's revolutionary. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1101.46s)]
*  The gods aren't like the ancient gods, just superheroes. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1103.5s)]
*  The gods are like moral exemplars for Socrates, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1106.88s)]
*  so they can't lie. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1109.0200000000002s)]
*  But he also says, but I know I'm not wise. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1110.14s)]
*  How can those both be true? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1112.8600000000001s)]
*  And he turns it into this quest. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1115.3000000000002s)]
*  So he goes, and he keeps asking people, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1117.5s)]
*  So somebody claims to know something, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1121.14s)]
*  or they know what a particular virtue is, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1122.6200000000001s)]
*  they know what courage is, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1124.18s)]
*  and he'll ask two generals, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1125.02s)]
*  and he'll constantly question them, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1126.94s)]
*  and he's trying to draw it out, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1129.78s)]
*  and he's trying to find out. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1131.54s)]
*  And what typically happens is, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1133.78s)]
*  it's called a dialogue, Plato wrote. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1136.9s)]
*  It ends with no clear answer, no clear definition, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1138.58s)]
*  but Socrates isn't a skeptic. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1141.3s)]
*  So he doesn't get a clear answer, but that's okay. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1143.1s)]
*  The goal is the goal to get a clear answer, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1148.1399999999999s)]
*  just to create conversation. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1150.34s)]
*  Beyond that, the goal is to get people to take up his quest. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1152.34s)]
*  So he's talking to these two generals, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1158.82s)]
*  and the two generals about courage, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1160.3799999999999s)]
*  one of them does the, I just know, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1161.9399999999998s)]
*  he just speaks from his intuition, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1163.82s)]
*  and Socrates destroys that, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1165.06s)]
*  shows him the contradictions of the problem. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1166.58s)]
*  The other quotes, so the first person speaks [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1168.4199999999998s)]
*  from a first person perspective, well I just know, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1171.6599999999999s)]
*  and Socrates destroys that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1174.86s)]
*  And the other person speaks from this third person, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1176.78s)]
*  well, here's a technical definition [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1180.1399999999999s)]
*  I got from the sophists, and blah, blah, blah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1181.86s)]
*  Yeah, nerd. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1183.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and Socrates destroys that. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1184.3s)]
*  And then there's, and Socrates can't offer definition. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1186.06s)]
*  You think, what was this all for? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1190.1399999999999s)]
*  But you have to, see, in a dialogue, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1192.4599999999998s)]
*  you have to pay attention to the drama, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1193.9799999999998s)]
*  not just the argument. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1195.2199999999998s)]
*  Because what the two generals say is, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1197.02s)]
*  we want our sons to come and spend time with you [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1199.26s)]
*  and live with you, Socrates, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1201.34s)]
*  because our sons are gonna get courage from you. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1203.4199999999998s)]
*  Socrates can't explain, he can't define courage. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1206.2199999999998s)]
*  If you think you can put courage into a definition, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1210.6200000000001s)]
*  you don't get it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1212.6200000000001s)]
*  Right, you have to get into this, not the first person, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1214.5s)]
*  or the third person, this second person, you. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1216.94s)]
*  Us together, right, you catch it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1218.98s)]
*  But it's a caught truth, remember we were talking about? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1221.02s)]
*  And what happens is, Socrates exemplifies what it is, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1224.26s)]
*  and he lives it in conversation with people [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1228.8200000000002s)]
*  so that they start to catch that orientation [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1233.26s)]
*  and catch his quest. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1236.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1237.74s)]
*  And was that a new thing at the time, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1238.9s)]
*  to have that sort of energy, to have that, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1240.5s)]
*  like, for people to really start to question things [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1242.66s)]
*  like that? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1245.9s)]
*  So, as far as we can tell, and this is why [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1246.74s)]
*  they call this the Socratic Revolution, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1248.38s)]
*  and there doesn't seem to be any of the ancient sources [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1249.8200000000002s)]
*  that contradict this. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1252.7s)]
*  Socrates invents, discovers, we don't have to, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1253.9s)]
*  there's a Latin word that's much better, inventio, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1257.98s)]
*  it means to discover or invent, right? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1260.02s)]
*  He inventios, right, this way of helping people [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1263.0600000000002s)]
*  to give birth to themselves. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1267.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1269.3400000000001s)]
*  So, the people I work with, we've tried to reverse [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1270.18s)]
*  engineer this practice, we call it dialectic [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1273.5s)]
*  into dialogos, and we have workshops that sort of get [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1276.26s)]
*  people to take this up, and so, what we do is, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1279.3s)]
*  we'll have them do these practices around a virtue, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1282.74s)]
*  like courage, more honesty, authenticity. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1285.22s)]
*  And what happens is, and we tell them this, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1289.8200000000002s)]
*  but they also realize it, right? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1294.9s)]
*  The point isn't to be right about this, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1297.9s)]
*  the point is to come into right relationship [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1300.06s)]
*  with the virtue, and that's what happens [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1302.26s)]
*  when they do these practices. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1303.74s)]
*  People come out and go, I'm kind of experiencing [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1304.78s)]
*  something like awe, and a love, I always thought [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1306.9s)]
*  I always knew what honesty was, like the technical [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1310.94s)]
*  definition or the intuition, like the two generals, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1312.9s)]
*  but now I don't, but I'm like Socrates. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1315.22s)]
*  So, you get this right orientation, and now we go back [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1319.7s)]
*  to Socrates, because he finally resolved that paradox [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1323.98s)]
*  that he had from the gods. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1327.5800000000002s)]
*  He realized that he was wise, in that he knew [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1329.14s)]
*  when he did not know something, but not in the shallow [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1332.9s)]
*  sense that I don't know about Albanian tin production [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1336.18s)]
*  or something like that, but in this sense we're talking [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1338.9s)]
*  about, which is like, I really don't know what honesty is. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1340.9s)]
*  I have a love for it, and I'm orient, I want to be [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1344.8200000000002s)]
*  in the right relationship, I want to open myself up, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1347.7s)]

*  When it comes to searching for meaning, right? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1469.6599999999999s)]
*  Like as a person, you know? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1472.58s)]
*  Do we do it, is it something that we do as individuals? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1474.8999999999999s)]
*  Is there any value in finding meaning as an individual? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1482.22s)]
*  It feels like to me, sometimes more like the value [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1484.9399999999998s)]
*  is finding meaning as a species or a group, right? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1487.26s)]
*  I guess when I think about meaning, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1491.98s)]
*  I don't think like what is the meaning for me? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1494.26s)]
*  What is the purpose of my life? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1497.5s)]
*  I find my brain often thinks more like [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1499.34s)]
*  what is our purpose, right? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1501.7s)]
*  What is our meaning? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1503.62s)]
*  So the individual poll is you need to cultivate wisdom. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1506.58s)]
*  But what's the collective poll? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1513.86s)]
*  And you put your finger on it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1515.06s)]
*  So what is this meaning thing? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1516.94s)]
*  So if you do research on it, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1519.26s)]
*  there's four dimensions to it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1521.18s)]
*  And the one that people think it's synonymous with [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1524.1s)]
*  is having a purpose. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1526.82s)]
*  That's only one of the dimensions. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1528.02s)]
*  It's actually not the most important one. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1529.1399999999999s)]
*  Of the dimensions of meaning. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1530.78s)]
*  Yeah, meaning in life. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1532.02s)]
*  So we're not talking about like the meaning of a sentence. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1532.98s)]
*  We're talking about what makes your life worth living [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1535.06s)]
*  even though it has all the frustrations and failures [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1537.78s)]
*  and faults and flaws in it. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1541.46s)]
*  Right, because I think especially you get to like [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1543.3s)]
*  a middle of your life kind of or ballpark, you know? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1544.78s)]
*  And you start, that really starts to hit home. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1547.4199999999998s)]
*  You're like, oh, well, my youth is disappearing. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1549.3799999999999s)]
*  What is my purpose here? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1552.26s)]
*  And then is it the purpose of just me [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1554.98s)]
*  or am I part of a group and we have a purpose? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1557.1000000000001s)]
*  Those are the questions, yeah, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1560.42s)]
*  that I really kind of see us getting hit with a lot. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1561.46s)]
*  So purpose is important, but there's other factors. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1564.74s)]
*  One was, it was in the literature, it was called coherence. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1568.82s)]
*  But some of the original experiments have failed [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1571.6200000000001s)]
*  to replicate and so it's a broader notion. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1573.3s)]
*  It's more like your world has to make sense to you. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1575.02s)]
*  It can't be absurd, right? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1578.02s)]
*  Because if the world becomes absurd, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1580.38s)]
*  then you start to really feel that reality is meaningless. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1582.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, that's starting, that's another thing [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1585.02s)]
*  that's starting to happen. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1586.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, we can go into that. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1587.18s)]
*  Yeah, we can, we can. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1588.5s)]
*  And that's very different. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1589.6200000000001s)]
*  People can act on purpose even within an absurd world. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1590.46s)]
*  Well, a lot of my meaning I've noticed, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1595.8600000000001s)]
*  recently it seemed a lot like the texture [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1598.22s)]
*  or the fabric of society is kind of eroding in America, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1605.9s)]
*  like a lot of traditions are being said [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1610.46s)]
*  that they're no good. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1613.26s)]
*  We're trying to renegotiate our past [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1614.3s)]
*  to make it look a certain way. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1618.14s)]
*  Everything's in question. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1620.98s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of things are in question. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1622.14s)]
*  A lot of people are saying that even the Pledge of Allegiance [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1623.6200000000001s)]
*  for just things that gave us all commonality [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1627.18s)]
*  seem to be disappearing. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1630.6200000000001s)]
*  And so I realized that that started to hurt me [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1633.8200000000002s)]
*  because I was like, man, a lot of my meaning as a person, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1636.8600000000001s)]
*  I had attached to a lot of these commonalities [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1641.1000000000001s)]
*  and I didn't realize that until they started to go away. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1643.94s)]
*  I'm like, well, if this stuff doesn't mean anything, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1646.22s)]
*  then do I mean anything? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1649.7s)]
*  Okay, so notice that, notice that. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1650.94s)]
*  So that's the two missing dimensions. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1652.38s)]
*  One is people, right, one is their reality can't be flat. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1655.0200000000002s)]
*  It has to have a depth. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1661.94s)]
*  They have to be able to point to something to say, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1663.5s)]
*  this is really real. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1665.8200000000002s)]
*  If everything feels sort of illusory, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1667.9399999999998s)]
*  then you're also in a kind of a nightmare situation. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1670.82s)]
*  But the one you just pointed to, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1673.8999999999999s)]
*  this is the crucial one and this is the one, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1675.02s)]
*  and I'm gonna punt a little bit here. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1676.58s)]
*  This is the one that matters, it's called mattering. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1677.62s)]
*  This is the one that matters the most. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1679.4599999999998s)]
*  And mattering is this. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1681.2199999999998s)]
*  There's a really good book by Susan Wolf called [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1685.58s)]
*  Meaning in Life and Why It Matters. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1687.54s)]
*  The metaphor people use is, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1691.6599999999999s)]
*  I wanna feel connected to something larger than myself, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1693.74s)]
*  something bigger than myself. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1696.02s)]
*  And here's a way of seeing if you have this in your life [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1697.86s)]
*  and why it might have come into question [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1700.82s)]
*  like you were just talking about. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1702.46s)]
*  Ask yourself, what do you want to exist even if you don't? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1703.62s)]
*  And how much of a difference do you make to it now? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1708.42s)]
*  Okay, so take me through an example of that. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1711.82s)]
*  So let me think, what do I want to exist? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1713.62s)]
*  Even if you don't. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1715.94s)]
*  Even if I don't exist? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1716.78s)]
*  Probably families. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1720.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so these are people, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1721.7s)]
*  you want them to exist even if you don't? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1723.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1725.22s)]
*  Happy children, happy families maybe [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1726.54s)]
*  would be something I would say. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1728.74s)]
*  And do you think you make much of a difference [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1730.06s)]
*  to them right now? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1731.6200000000001s)]
*  Not a ton. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1733.34s)]
*  Right, so you need a good answer for both of those [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1734.38s)]
*  to have a strong sense of meaning in life. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1737.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay, so take me through an example of somebody [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1740.18s)]
*  that would have a good answer. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1742.22s)]
*  What would be an answer that would probably [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1743.58s)]
*  leave somebody feeling fulfilled [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1745.02s)]
*  after they ask themselves those questions? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1746.34s)]
*  Well, I wanna point to something [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1748.34s)]
*  that you put your finger on. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1750.06s)]
*  There's a decline in the bigger picture, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1752.46s)]
*  a worldview, and it, the worldviews, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1756.42s)]
*  that we experience them, and I'm trying to use this term [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1760.38s)]
*  very broadly, religiously. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1763.7s)]
*  So I don't mean just like Christianity [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1765.02s)]
*  or Judaism or something like that, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1768.42s)]
*  but I also mean what used to be called [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1770.6200000000001s)]
*  American civil religion. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1771.94s)]
*  Like you have your heroes and things are sacred [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1773.74s)]
*  like the flag and you pledge allegiance, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1776.18s)]
*  which is a kind of prayer, right? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1778.38s)]
*  And so, and both of those religious frameworks, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1780.5800000000002s)]
*  and even though they're tearing each other apart [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1784.14s)]
*  about it right now, they're falling, right? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1785.78s)]
*  And so people used to say they would die for their country. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1787.94s)]
*  People did it in World War II. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1793.1000000000001s)]
*  They want the US, the United States, to continue existing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1795.0600000000002s)]
*  They think the universe is a better place [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1799.5800000000002s)]
*  if the US is in it, and they are making a difference. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1801.98s)]
*  They're in, like they're in Germany [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1805.46s)]
*  and they're liberating the world from tyranny. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1807.82s)]
*  And so they're making a real difference, right, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1810.86s)]
*  to this overarching worldview, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1813.54s)]
*  American democracy, Americanism. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1816.9399999999998s)]
*  They had so much meaning in life, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1820.58s)]
*  like Socrates, they're willing to die for it. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1823.26s)]
*  And they must have. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1824.98s)]
*  I mean to think like, yes, I mean they had people [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1825.86s)]
*  that were lying to get into the draft. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1829.1s)]
*  Like I wanna go serve my country, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1833.3s)]
*  I will die for my country. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1835.46s)]
*  They believe that much in it. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1836.7s)]
*  It feels like we're further from that now for sure. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1838.66s)]
*  So that, the idea of your country being that thing [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1842.26s)]
*  is probably less. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1845.74s)]
*  Right, so that's the other pole now. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1847.5s)]
*  Remember we talked about the individual pole. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1849.6200000000001s)]
*  Then there's the worldview, right? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1851.3s)]
*  The pole that we, no one, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1854.02s)]
*  you didn't invent English, did I? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1856.6200000000001s)]
*  Right, these are the things we invent together [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1858.46s)]
*  and we evolve together and we participate in together. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1861.18s)]
*  And one is, like there was a great metaphor [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1864.06s)]
*  by an academic called Peter Berger, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1866.34s)]
*  he called it the sacred canopy. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1868.94s)]
*  Where you had this worldview that basically gave you, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1870.82s)]
*  it told you how to be an agent in the world [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1875.54s)]
*  and it made the world a meaningful arena. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1879.34s)]
*  So there was an agent arena relationship [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1881.78s)]
*  and they were attuned to each other. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1883.86s)]
*  So you knew what to do, you knew how to fit in. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1885.4199999999998s)]
*  And so you had this worldview that grounded things, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1888.34s)]
*  and this is the bigger picture, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1892.78s)]
*  and then people could connect their personal [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1894.38s)]
*  wisdom cultivation to this bigger thing [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1899.94s)]
*  and enhance their meaning in life. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1902.5s)]
*  And this is what religions, both civil and religious, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1904.14s)]
*  sorry we don't have, we need another sacred I suppose, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1909.5s)]
*  civil and sacred religions, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1912.3s)]
*  they were both doing for people [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1914.42s)]
*  and these have been breaking down for a whole, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1915.9s)]
*  so those are the historical factors. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1918.5s)]
*  And when they break down, people's ability to find purpose [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1920.3799999999999s)]
*  and depth and clarity and mattering gets undermined [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1924.82s)]
*  and their self-deception exacerbates [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1930.34s)]
*  because they get isolated like we were talking about in COVID, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1933.6599999999999s)]
*  they get disconnected from a shared worldview [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1936.06s)]
*  that gives them, these ecologies of practices, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1939.62s)]
*  you can't do them on your own. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1943.02s)]
*  You'll fall prey to sort of, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1945.02s)]
*  if you're just an autodidact, like a self-learner, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1946.98s)]
*  you'll fall prey to all your biases [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1949.3s)]
*  and all your egocentrisms [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1950.78s)]
*  and your unrealized comfort zones. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1952.06s)]
*  You need other people to be. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1953.78s)]
*  So we need each other to have meaning. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1955.22s)]
*  We transcend each other through each other. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1957.3s)]
*  So this is Socrates. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1960.1s)]
*  You know how I can most transcend myself [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1962.94s)]
*  and overcome my bias and my narrow frame? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1965.02s)]
*  Is you challenging you. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1967.3799999999999s)]
*  We are the keys to each other's locks. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1969.54s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1971.06s)]
*  And so what happened is, you need that worldview [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1972.66s)]
*  to home those ecologies of practice, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1975.66s)]
*  give them legitimacy, give them tradition, right? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1979.34s)]
*  Which is not the same thing as nostalgia. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1981.7s)]
*  And then what we've done is we've undermined that worldview. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1983.34s)]
*  We've torn apart the ecologies of practices [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1987.1s)]
*  and people are like, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1991.3799999999999s)]
*  they've largely abandoned the legacy religions. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1992.98s)]
*  They're now abandoning the civil religions. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1995.06s)]
*  Even the very weak religion of popular culture [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=1998.62s)]
*  is breaking down. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2001.86s)]
*  Oh, there's more Fortnite players [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2003.22s)]
*  than there are Protestants probably. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2004.62s)]
*  Right, right, yes. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2006.06s)]
*  But look at how those, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2008.02s)]
*  like a symptom of the meaning crisis [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2010.1799999999998s)]
*  is an attempt to create worldviews that have a myth. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2011.98s)]
*  When I say mythological, I don't mean that negatively. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2016.4599999999998s)]
*  I don't mean like a lie. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2018.86s)]
*  I mean, myths aren't ancient stories about the past. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2019.6999999999998s)]
*  They're stories about perennial problems and patterns. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2023.02s)]
*  And so think about the whole MC universe. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2027.6599999999999s)]
*  We call it a universe. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2030.4199999999998s)]
*  We're trying to create this entire worldview [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2031.6599999999999s)]
*  in which basically we have Bronze Age gods [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2033.5s)]
*  who nevertheless are Socratic heroes and pursue virtue [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2035.9s)]
*  and they fly around and do all this stuff [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2039.26s)]
*  and it's falling apart. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2041.14s)]
*  We can't even keep that running, right? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2042.14s)]
*  Like this is how bad things are. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2044.94s)]
*  And so the perennial problems, they start to get worse. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2046.94s)]
*  They tear out what's left of the worldview. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2051.06s)]
*  The worldview can't home the ecology. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2053.62s)]
*  People get more foolish, more self, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2055.94s)]
*  and the whole thing just spirals. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2057.54s)]
*  And so if that's- [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2059.5s)]
*  Was that a good answer by the way to the two polls? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2060.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was really good, man. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2062.82s)]
*  I think it was really good. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2064.62s)]
*  I'm doing a decent job, I think, at keeping up. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2066.2200000000003s)]
*  Good. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2068.98s)]
*  I'm trying to make it accessible for listeners [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2069.82s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2072.3s)]
*  I think you're doing a great job at that, thank you. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2073.34s)]
*  Oh, thanks, man, yeah, I appreciate it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2075.2200000000003s)]
*  So what happens historically in a time [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2077.7s)]
*  where we get to a place like this? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2080.3s)]
*  Is there a path? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2082.38s)]
*  Has this happened before in time? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2083.3s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2084.58s)]
*  So we don't need to be alarmed at the point [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2085.86s)]
*  like humans have never been through this. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2087.62s)]
*  That's right, we've been through it before. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2089.9s)]
*  Now, there's two stances on this [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2092.1s)]
*  that are both sort of wrong because they're extreme. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2099.94s)]
*  One is, oh, this is, human beings have always said [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2101.94s)]
*  that meanings and problems, and it's a dismissive thing. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2104.5s)]
*  And then the other one is, no, this is completely, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2107.2999999999997s)]
*  absolutely unique. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2109.1s)]
*  And there's truth to both. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2110.5s)]
*  What's unique is we face a set of problems [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2111.98s)]
*  that are global in a way there was never global problems [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  that were this, like this, you know, complex [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2117.86s)]
*  and growing, like we face an interconnection [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2122.7000000000003s)]
*  of the advent of, you know, AGI. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2124.7400000000002s)]
*  We're already facing, you know, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2128.1s)]
*  the growing impact of social media. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2130.82s)]
*  You know, people are looking at issues [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2133.6600000000003s)]
*  around the environment, energy. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2135.62s)]
*  As you said, our political economic system [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2138.42s)]
*  is breaking down, it's gridlocking, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2141.54s)]
*  and people are losing faith in it. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2143.14s)]
*  And I use that word deliberately in a deep way. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2145.58s)]
*  And so those are, I think, unique things we're facing. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2149.18s)]
*  And I think when we're in a meaning crisis, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2153.9s)]
*  it sort of hamstrings us. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2157.5s)]
*  It really weakens our ability to turn our best wisdom [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2160.66s)]
*  towards these problems. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2165.42s)]
*  Because when we're in a meaning crisis, right, so. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2166.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, especially now if we're all isolated [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2170.14s)]
*  and we're not even. We're isolated. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2171.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not our best, it's very self-motivated. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2173.42s)]
*  It's not our, like, group conscience. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2175.7s)]
*  We're acting out of fear a lot of people. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2179.06s)]
*  Yeah, and we're acting out of, like, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2181.4599999999996s)]
*  and our ability to cut through the bullshit [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2182.8999999999996s)]
*  and to realize when we're in self-deception [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2185.7s)]
*  is, you know, being seriously challenged. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2188.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2190.4199999999996s)]
*  So our ability to handle this is very weak. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2191.2999999999997s)]
*  But it is also the case that there have been other points [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2194.2999999999997s)]
*  in time in which there have been, not globally, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2197.4599999999996s)]
*  but like in the ancient West, the Hellenistic period, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2201.1s)]
*  there was a meaning crisis at that time, too. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2205.18s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2208.7s)]
*  So it's basically, so there's Alexander the Great. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2210.98s)]
*  So Socrates. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2214.46s)]
*  Was he great or not? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2215.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, it depends. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2216.62s)]
*  So. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2218.06s)]
*  Because that's a straight, I mean, that's like, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2219.8999999999996s)]
*  you're not even leaving any, you know, you're saying hey. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2221.8999999999996s)]
*  So he changes the course of the history [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2227.74s)]
*  of Western civilization in a profound way. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2232.18s)]
*  And if that's what you mean by great, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2235.42s)]
*  just sort of changing the course of things, he's great. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2236.9s)]
*  Okay, I'll give it to him then. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2239.66s)]
*  Well, but I also want to say, so my partner, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2241.14s)]
*  she's Persian, and Alexander the Great is the bad guy [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2245.02s)]
*  in the Persian world, right? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2248.02s)]
*  Oh, so the person you asked, huh? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2249.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2250.8199999999997s)]
*  So he's like, right. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2251.98s)]
*  But what he does is, like, he conquers most of the Silk Road [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2254.14s)]
*  and, you know, some of the major civilizations [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2259.14s)]
*  in Asia, Europe, and Africa. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2266.1s)]
*  And then he dies at a young age. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2269.06s)]
*  And so his empire breaks up into, first of all, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2272.94s)]
*  there's a period of fighting, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2275.7s)]
*  and the generals carve up his empire, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2279.06s)]
*  and then there's just ongoing warfare. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2281.7799999999997s)]
*  Now, I just want to compare two people. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2283.8599999999997s)]
*  Somebody living at the time just before Alexander, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2286.2s)]
*  the time of Aristotle, who taught Alexander, by the way, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2289.16s)]
*  right, this is their life. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2291.9199999999996s)]
*  They live in a, like a polis, a city. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2294.16s)]
*  They've lived there, and their ancestors have lived there [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2297.2s)]
*  for all their life. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2299.68s)]
*  Everybody around them speaks the same language, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2300.52s)]
*  and everybody practices the same religion. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2302.08s)]
*  If you're in Athens, you participate, well, if you're a male, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2304.56s)]
*  so it's, right, you participate directly in the government, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2308.04s)]
*  right, you know, but in person, the leaders. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2311.56s)]
*  So, right, this is like, after Alexander, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2315.08s)]
*  you're now in a world in which the people, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2320.08s)]
*  you might have been uprooted, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2324.44s)]
*  people have been uprooted, moved around. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2326.04s)]
*  It was a little more global than at that point, kind of. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2327.56s)]
*  Exactly, but that's exactly the parallel, right? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2329.84s)]
*  So people around you speak a different language, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2332.04s)]
*  they haven't been there for years, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2334.08s)]
*  you might not have, your ancestors might not have been there, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2335.2s)]
*  they have different religions. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2337.6s)]
*  Right, you've conquered, there's an area's been conquered, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2338.8s)]
*  so now there's more of you to consider [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2340.56s)]
*  whenever you're making laws and rules. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2342.44s)]
*  And these kingdoms are constantly shifting, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2344.3599999999997s)]
*  so you may go to sleep in the Ptolemaic Empire [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2346.08s)]
*  and wake up in the Seleucia Empire and you don't know. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2348.2s)]
*  And that's the thing, the government is thousands [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2350.4399999999996s)]
*  of kilometers away from you, so people felt, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2352.8799999999997s)]
*  there's a term for this, it's called domicide, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2356.3999999999996s)]
*  which is the killing of home. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2358.64s)]
*  They felt they didn't feel at home in the world anymore, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2360.7999999999997s)]
*  so this has been called an age of anxiety. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2364.04s)]
*  Now, what happened at that time, and in some ways, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2367.08s)]
*  this is the project I'm trying to do now, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2370.6s)]
*  what happened at the time is philosophy changed [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2373.2s)]
*  in order to address this meaning crisis. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2376.4399999999996s)]
*  So before, with Socrates and Plato, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2380.4399999999996s)]
*  you already have these questions about meaning and wisdom, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2382.2799999999997s)]
*  but what gets added to this existential, ethical dimension [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2385.4399999999996s)]
*  is what you might call a therapeutic dimension. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2388.7999999999997s)]
*  Epicurus, who's one of the prototypical philosophers [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2391.8799999999997s)]
*  from this time, said, call no man a philosopher [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  who has not alleviated the suffering of others. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2397.12s)]
*  The philosopher became the physician of the soul, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2400.2799999999997s)]
*  and what happened is philosophy took on this dimension [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2403.3999999999996s)]
*  of how to alleviate anxiety, how to increase people's [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2406.24s)]
*  sense of meaning and connectedness, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2411.24s)]
*  and we got Epicureanism and Stoicism, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2414.12s)]
*  and then eventually we got Neoplatonism [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2417.4399999999996s)]
*  that drew them all together, and we got, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2419.4799999999996s)]
*  and you also had the emergence of new religions [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2421.68s)]
*  that were trying to, right, there was syncretic religions [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2424.2799999999997s)]
*  in which people were merging gods, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2427.04s)]
*  or mother goddesses, because when you don't have a home, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2429.52s)]
*  a mother goddess becomes a really big thing, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2431.92s)]
*  Isis becomes a big deal, and of course, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2433.44s)]
*  Christianity emerges in this mix too. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2435.44s)]
*  Wow, so that's interesting because it's kind of where we are, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2438.1200000000003s)]
*  I see that where we've been now for a little bit, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2441.6000000000004s)]
*  like people are gathering around speakers, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2443.84s)]
*  or men and women who are able to share a message of hope [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2449.92s)]
*  or give them, make them feel like they have meaning [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2454.92s)]
*  or purpose, why people listen to, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2461.04s)]
*  or have started to listen to people like, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2463.76s)]
*  I mean, Jordan Peterson's an easy one [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2466.6s)]
*  because he's been very popular, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2468.36s)]
*  guys like you who are able to converse, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2470.12s)]
*  or just, you're able to put into words [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2473.04s)]
*  what a lot of people can't, that's one of the problems [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2475.2400000000002s)]
*  that a lot of us have, we can't put certain things [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2477.36s)]
*  into words, so we start to, especially in times like this, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2480.36s)]
*  we start to look to somebody who seems [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2483.4s)]
*  to have it together, I think. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2485.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2487.76s)]
*  Does that make any sense or no? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2488.6s)]
*  It does, and it lands, it lands very well, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2490.04s)]
*  but it lands with a sort of, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2493.4s)]
*  a very strong sense of responsibility. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2496.56s)]
*  That's true, maybe it's putting too much responsibility [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2500.92s)]
*  on those people, I guess I'm not looking at it [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2502.96s)]
*  from that perspective, I'm looking at it more from like, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2504.88s)]
*  the people in the polis, in the city or whatever, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2508.12s)]
*  who are like, what do we do now? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2512.16s)]
*  And you know, and like, as other things start to fall, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2514.3599999999997s)]
*  as the fabric of our society, the traditions and stuff, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2518.4s)]
*  start to get more opaque or whatever, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2521.64s)]
*  does opaque, does that mean opaque, like vey, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2526.2s)]
*  like you can't see them as well? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2527.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2529.52s)]
*  What do we do, you know? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2530.72s)]
*  And so you go to somebody who I think sounds [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2532.68s)]
*  like they know what they're doing. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2535.0s)]
*  Right, so it's again, there's a risk there, right? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2536.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a tremendous risk of, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2539.6s)]
*  and there's risk both ways, there's a risk of the person, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2542.36s)]
*  the figure being wrong, well being wrong, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2545.32s)]
*  or not caring if they're wrong, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2548.84s)]
*  there's a lot of bullshit, right? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2550.96s)]
*  And then there's also risk for the person, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2552.6400000000003s)]
*  they might be sincere, but you know, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2556.6000000000004s)]
*  for every myth we have in the Greek tradition of the hero, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2559.7200000000003s)]
*  we have an equal myth of hubris. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2563.1600000000003s)]
*  Hubris is when you try to be the gods, like Icarus, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2564.96s)]
*  you try to fly to the sun, or Phaeton, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2569.44s)]
*  you try to steer the chariot of the sun, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2573.12s)]
*  and Zeus has to kill you, all that. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2574.92s)]
*  Right, humility basically. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2578.36s)]
*  Right, and Socratic humility, right? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2579.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one way of understanding the human task [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2582.92s)]
*  is to keep a hold on both the fact that we're finite, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2585.56s)]
*  we're prone to error or self-deception and unforeseen fate, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2591.04s)]
*  but we're not just animals, we're also called to virtue, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2595.96s)]
*  we have a capacity to transcend, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2598.0s)]
*  and we have to hold the finitude [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2599.44s)]
*  and the transcendence together. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2601.28s)]
*  We just did the transcendence, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2602.36s)]
*  we can fall prey to thinking we're gods, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2603.48s)]
*  and then the hubris falls, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2605.72s)]
*  and that's what a lot of these thought leaders do. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2607.2s)]
*  And then on the other hand, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2610.24s)]
*  but if we don't give people something, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2611.56s)]
*  they can just collapse into their finitude, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2613.92s)]
*  and then they're subject to tyranny [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2616.8s)]
*  and servitude and despair. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2619.04s)]
*  And Plato is all about trying, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2620.52s)]
*  he uses Socrates to represent somebody who, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2622.32s)]
*  Socrates described himself as Metaxu, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2625.76s)]
*  he was always holding those two together. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2628.5200000000004s)]
*  And so I try to take on the responsibility [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2631.5200000000004s)]
*  you've put your finger on in, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2637.44s)]
*  and I try to live it that way. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2639.5200000000004s)]
*  And so, I mean, one of the things people say to me, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2642.88s)]
*  and it's really a profound compliment for me, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2650.5200000000004s)]
*  a lot of people say, John, you gave me the vocabulary, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2653.84s)]
*  like you were talking about a few minutes ago, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2657.8s)]
*  to talk about this, to think about it, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2659.1200000000003s)]
*  to talk to other people about it. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2660.7200000000003s)]
*  But I have to balance that off [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2663.92s)]
*  with a tendency to get too self-absorbed [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2666.56s)]
*  in my own terminology. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2670.92s)]
*  And that's the fallacy, it's one of the, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2672.04s)]
*  I don't know if the fallacy is a word, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2673.6000000000004s)]
*  but not wiener, I'm talking about the other thing, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2675.36s)]
*  which one? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2679.36s)]
*  Like a confusion, fallacy, you know what I'm talking about? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2681.04s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2684.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2685.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the fallacies of just being human. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2688.04s)]
*  It's like you can, when things start to go well, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2690.64s)]
*  this happened to me before in my life, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2693.7999999999997s)]
*  I started to get some popularity, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2695.3199999999997s)]
*  and things seemed like they were going good, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2696.8399999999997s)]
*  and there was a moment where I was like, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2698.6s)]
*  well, I started asking myself, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2701.48s)]
*  does God have some special plan for me? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2702.68s)]
*  Which is a dangerous thing to start asking yourself. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2706.12s)]
*  It's okay to ask, to be curious, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2708.8s)]
*  and see how I can be of service. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2711.6400000000003s)]
*  But part of that gets real tricky, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2715.2400000000002s)]
*  because then you start thinking you have some special power, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2717.0s)]
*  and that's where it can just get scary, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  and I think it's just being human, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2722.88s)]
*  it's part of the, that's what that fulcrum is right there, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2725.4s)]
*  is just trying to keep that even. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2729.6000000000004s)]
*  And Theo, I think about this daily. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2731.8s)]
*  I think about this daily. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2733.44s)]
*  I have an amazing team of people around me. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2734.88s)]
*  I have a non-for-profit organization, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2738.4s)]
*  the Breveke Foundation, that keeps the money [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2740.04s)]
*  and the power at an arm's length for me. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2742.36s)]
*  I'm not in charge of it. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2744.32s)]
*  I have a bunch of people around me [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2747.48s)]
*  who have been given ongoing non-negotiable permission [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2748.92s)]
*  to tell me if I'm starting to believe my own bullshit. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2752.04s)]
*  I'm not good. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2754.4s)]
*  You don't strike me as that person at all. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2755.7200000000003s)]
*  I wasn't trying to say that. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2758.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no, I'm just trying to examine this. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2759.88s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2761.56s)]
*  I examine it for myself sometimes, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2762.4s)]
*  because I have people that will say, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2763.7200000000003s)]
*  hey man, you really helped me with this, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2765.4s)]
*  or you've helped me like... [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2767.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's good. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2768.3599999999997s)]
*  Think about those things. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2769.2s)]
*  Right, it makes me feel like I'm being of service, right? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2770.04s)]
*  But then I have to be careful [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2772.48s)]
*  that I don't let that leave the room with me. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2774.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2777.68s)]
*  It's like beautiful music, right? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2780.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2782.0s)]
*  You joy in it while it's happening, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2782.8399999999997s)]
*  because somebody is sharing with you. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2785.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2787.52s)]
*  And you don't want to rain on somebody [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2788.3599999999997s)]
*  when they're sharing with you, because they need that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2790.72s)]
*  But it's like music. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2793.56s)]
*  When the song's done, the song's done. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2794.92s)]
*  Don't keep him in yourself as you leave, right? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2797.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2800.32s)]
*  Don't put your airpods in. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=2801.1600000000003s)]

*  So one thing that I think about [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3038.12s)]
*  when I think about meaning is like, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3039.88s)]
*  if you look at like some past cultures, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3042.08s)]
*  they had, they would give their, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3044.08s)]
*  when people were dying, they would give them like weapons [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3047.92s)]
*  to go in the afterlife with like medallions, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3051.44s)]
*  maybe a couple chocolates or fricking, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3054.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if they had butterscotchers or whatever [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3057.32s)]
*  back then, but a couple little candies for the road. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3059.0s)]
*  They would put that in their casket, right? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3061.36s)]
*  So imagine what life was like when you thought that death, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3064.56s)]
*  like there was a whole, like this was just a preparation. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3069.84s)]
*  That must've added so much, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3073.84s)]
*  I feel like that would've added so much meaning. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3075.32s)]
*  It can. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3077.92s)]
*  To being alive, whereas now that doesn't seem, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3078.76s)]
*  it's not as prevalent. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3082.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, nobody, I was at a place one time, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3083.28s)]
*  somebody maybe put a couple quailudes [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3085.8s)]
*  or something in a dude's pocket or casket, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3087.6000000000004s)]
*  but I've never been there where they're armoring him up [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3090.1200000000003s)]
*  and putting him in like under armor or anything. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3092.48s)]
*  So that's a really important thing. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3096.8s)]
*  There's a really great book. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3099.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm teaching an online course for the [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3102.28s)]
*  Halkian Academy on Beyond Nihilism, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3103.68s)]
*  and we started it with Tillich's book, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3106.52s)]
*  The Courage to Be, which is a really great book. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3108.56s)]
*  The Courage to Be by Tillich, you said? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3111.3999999999996s)]
*  Paul Tillich, yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3113.12s)]
*  And he talks about these things [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3114.44s)]
*  that can really take people into despair. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3117.16s)]
*  And he talks about them analytically, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3120.2799999999997s)]
*  but he's very aware that they can interpenetrate [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3122.04s)]
*  and you can have multiple ones at the same time. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3124.72s)]
*  And one is the one you just mentioned. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3127.7599999999998s)]
*  It's mortality. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3130.68s)]
*  But you have to broaden it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3132.84s)]
*  You have to understand mortality. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3135.12s)]
*  Think about, we talk about a fatality, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3136.72s)]
*  but the base of that is not death. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3140.24s)]
*  The base word in there is fate. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3141.92s)]
*  This is the idea, your death is just an example [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3143.64s)]
*  of how the universe is perpetually profoundly [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3147.12s)]
*  beyond your control. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3151.68s)]
*  You could have met the woman of your life [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3152.92s)]
*  and you both know it and you're gonna have, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3155.84s)]
*  and you step into traffic and the truck hits you. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3158.16s)]
*  And it's not the case, like in a romantic comedy, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3161.2400000000002s)]
*  that the great narrative that is unfolding. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3164.52s)]
*  Like Meet Joe Black, that's what happened, I think, in that. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3167.12s)]
*  Yes, so we confront fatality, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3169.2s)]
*  which ultimately in our mortality, that's one. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3175.56s)]
*  One is the one we've been talking about, meaninglessness. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3180.4s)]
*  The world can just suddenly seem flat and futile [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3183.0s)]
*  and we can feel alienated and anxious. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3186.16s)]
*  And then the other one is guilt. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3189.24s)]
*  Not just in the everyday sense of like, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3193.0s)]
*  oh, I shouldn't have said that to Peter. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3196.24s)]
*  It's in the more profound sense of, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3199.2s)]
*  I think I'm just a bad person. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3201.7999999999997s)]
*  And not necessarily evil. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3207.52s)]
*  The weight of your flaws and your failings and your faults [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3209.9599999999996s)]
*  can be magnified, especially if you're very honest. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3214.96s)]
*  I mean, Theo, I don't wanna live forever [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3218.96s)]
*  because I don't want to try and carry that boulder [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3220.88s)]
*  that will get larger and larger of my flaws and my fates, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3224.48s)]
*  my finitude, right? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3228.36s)]
*  And that can weigh you down. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3230.16s)]
*  And so I think one of the things that, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3232.0s)]
*  I think you're right, one of the things [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3237.0s)]
*  that most people have lost, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3238.04s)]
*  although not as many as you might think so, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3240.04s)]
*  although participation in the legacy religions, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3241.76s)]
*  the world religions is declining, even in America now, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3246.76s)]
*  where America was always the weird exception, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3250.36s)]
*  but now it's starting to decline. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3252.0400000000004s)]
*  So in a couple of generations, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3253.32s)]
*  most people in America won't be religious adherents. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3254.92s)]
*  Wow, that's scary feeling. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3258.36s)]
*  Well, that's domicide, so welcome to it, sorry. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3260.8s)]
*  That's domicide? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3263.5600000000004s)]
*  The loss of home, loss of home. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3264.4s)]
*  Oh, the loss of feeling at home. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3266.36s)]
*  Loss of feeling at home in the universe. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3267.96s)]
*  We used to call it a cosmos. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3270.16s)]
*  Cosmos was like cosmetic, beautiful, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3271.0s)]
*  and now we call it universe, right? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3273.4s)]
*  It's flat. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3274.96s)]
*  There's no depth to it. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3275.7999999999997s)]
*  So all three of those intersect. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3277.72s)]
*  Now, one of the things, and I want to go back to, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3279.92s)]
*  remember I mentioned the Hellenistic philosophers, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3282.8399999999997s)]
*  like Epicurus, even Socrates. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3285.7999999999997s)]
*  They tried to address the problem of mortality. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3287.92s)]
*  Socrates said all of philosophy [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3292.92s)]
*  is a preparation for death, right? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3294.08s)]
*  And they tried to address that problem [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3296.7599999999998s)]
*  in a different way. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3298.44s)]
*  Can I try, just to get people, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3299.28s)]
*  first of all, one thing, other cultures. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3302.28s)]
*  So I have a lot, I've been practicing within Taoism [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3304.68s)]
*  and Buddhist practices also for three decades. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3307.2000000000003s)]
*  So if you look even in Vedanta, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3309.88s)]
*  if you look within Hinduism, at least important, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3313.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to talk about them [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3315.64s)]
*  as they're homogeneous, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3316.88s)]
*  but at least large swaths of Hinduism, Buddhism, right? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3317.7200000000003s)]
*  Immortality is a curse. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3321.4s)]
*  Immortality is a curse. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3323.52s)]
*  Immortality is a curse. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3325.04s)]
*  Immortality is a curse. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3326.36s)]
*  Immortality, living forever is a curse. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3328.04s)]
*  They all viewed it like that, you're saying. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3329.92s)]
*  Yes, because the idea is reincarnation, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3331.48s)]
*  you come back again and again and again and again, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3334.84s)]
*  and like I said, this is kind of like karma. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3337.1600000000003s)]
*  The faults and the flaws and the failings pile up, right? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3340.7200000000003s)]
*  And it becomes just horrible. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3346.6s)]
*  And what you seek for is moksha. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3351.92s)]
*  You seek for liberation from rebirth [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3353.76s)]
*  or reincarnation, or you seek nirvana. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3357.04s)]
*  I don't want to be reborn. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3358.64s)]
*  Oh, so in some of those religions [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3361.12s)]
*  where there's reincarnation, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3363.12s)]
*  they seek to be freed from that? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3364.48s)]
*  That is the core of Vedanta. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3366.08s)]
*  You want to realize moksha by realizing [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3367.6s)]
*  that the ground of your being, your soul, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3371.6s)]
*  and the ground of reality are one, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3374.72s)]
*  and that liberates you from being attached to, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3376.9199999999996s)]
*  I want this, I want this to survive, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3380.08s)]
*  I want this to survive, and let go of that. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3382.7999999999997s)]
*  And Buddhism has something similar. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3385.2s)]
*  It tries to convince you that the idea [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3387.12s)]
*  that you have a substantial soul, atman, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3388.96s)]
*  is ultimately false, and if you can really truly, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3392.0s)]
*  not just as an idea, but like we were talking about earlier, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3395.2s)]
*  if you can let go of it all the way through, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3397.3999999999996s)]
*  then you'll be liberated from that. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3400.0s)]
*  So it's a different response. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3401.9199999999996s)]
*  Now, the Hellenistic philosophers did something [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3404.04s)]
*  very similar in the West. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3406.2s)]
*  Epicurus, he was famous for this. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3407.3999999999996s)]
*  He didn't try and convince people that they were immortal. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3410.3199999999997s)]
*  He tried to get people to change [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3413.84s)]
*  the way they frame their mortality. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3416.8s)]
*  So he famously said, where death is, I am not. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3419.6400000000003s)]
*  Where I am, death is not. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3422.4s)]
*  What's he doing there? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3425.36s)]
*  Is he playing games? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3426.2000000000003s)]
*  What he's saying is, you can't actually experience [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3427.02s)]
*  being dead, because if you're dead, you're not there. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3429.56s)]
*  There's no experience. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3433.44s)]
*  And as long as you're experiencing, you're not dead. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3434.28s)]
*  You can never have the experience of being dead. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3437.2000000000003s)]
*  So what do you, no, people say, that's not good enough. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3441.72s)]
*  That's not the point. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3444.3999999999996s)]
*  The point is, so he's trying to get you [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3445.24s)]
*  to be more discerning. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3446.56s)]
*  What is it you are afraid of? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3447.7599999999998s)]
*  You're afraid of dying. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3450.08s)]
*  You're afraid of going through the process [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3451.52s)]
*  of losing your vitality, losing your relationships, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3453.68s)]
*  losing your body. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3458.8799999999997s)]
*  You're not afraid of death. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3460.16s)]
*  You're afraid, like you're not afraid of all the time [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3461.48s)]
*  before your birth when you didn't exist, right? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3463.3199999999997s)]
*  So what is it you're afraid of dying? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3466.24s)]
*  You're afraid of losing. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3468.7999999999997s)]
*  So here's what we could do. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3470.56s)]
*  Find the things that you can keep up until [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3472.16s)]
*  the very last moment of consciousness. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3475.96s)]
*  And he said the one thing, the two things [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3478.12s)]
*  that you can always have are wisdom and friendship. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3480.04s)]
*  Cultivate wise friendships and friendships [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3484.28s)]
*  that support wisdom. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3486.12s)]
*  And he was suffering horrible illness as he was dying, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3487.24s)]
*  and he took that right through. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3490.7599999999998s)]
*  And he also taught people how to not fear the gods, right? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3492.24s)]
*  And so that was one response. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3496.76s)]
*  The Stoics, you know, Marcus Aurelius, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3501.2000000000003s)]
*  people all know Marcus Aurelius from the movies, right? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3504.28s)]
*  And Marcus Aurelius, what the Stoics said is, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3507.48s)]
*  look, the problem is what we set our hearts on, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3509.8s)]
*  what we identify with, right? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3514.0s)]
*  Like we're always assuming and assigning identities. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3516.1600000000003s)]
*  For example, right now I'm assuming the identity [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3518.92s)]
*  of like this academic person. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3521.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm assigning an identity to you. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3523.96s)]
*  But this isn't the identity I would have with my partner [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3525.36s)]
*  when I go home at night. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3528.04s)]
*  That would be weird, right? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3529.08s)]
*  And I wouldn't assign the, whoa, sorry, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3530.48s)]
*  are you gonna interview me now? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3532.4s)]
*  Right, that's weird, right? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3533.2400000000002s)]
*  And so we're always assuming and assigning identities, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3534.84s)]
*  and we're doing this in this interlocking manner, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3537.2400000000002s)]
*  that agent arena way. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3539.1600000000003s)]
*  But here's the thing, most of the time [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3540.7200000000003s)]
*  we do this unconsciously. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3542.04s)]
*  We do it mindlessly, yeah, automatically, reactively. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3543.36s)]
*  And so we set our, we identify with the wrong things. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3546.04s)]
*  And so what the Stoics said is, I'm gonna use, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3549.4s)]
*  I know viewers can't see, I'm drawing a horizontal line. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3551.8s)]
*  We identify with horizontal things. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3554.48s)]
*  We identify with trying to extend our life, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3556.08s)]
*  have more fame, have more power. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3558.6s)]
*  And they said, that's ultimately doomed. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3561.52s)]
*  You're pitting yourself against the universe. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3563.2s)]
*  The universe is gonna crush you. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3565.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3566.52s)]
*  Instead, go vertical. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3567.8s)]
*  Seneca said, even when you're painted into a corner, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3569.28s)]
*  you can jump into the sky. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3572.12s)]
*  So the vertical is, don't try and get the most extension [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3575.12s)]
*  of your life, try and get the greatest depth. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3578.92s)]
*  There's a book. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3582.56s)]
*  Wow, that's so powerful. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3583.6s)]
*  That's really, really cool. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3584.44s)]
*  Yeah, and so you live that, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3585.7599999999998s)]
*  and you try and realize that now. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3587.0s)]
*  They did this in... [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3588.84s)]
*  Even when you're painting a corner, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3590.16s)]
*  you can jump into the sky. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3591.08s)]
*  And so things people can do when they feel like [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3592.48s)]
*  they're painting into a corner, they can help somebody else. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3594.72s)]
*  That creates probably some... [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3598.36s)]
*  And they can get more in touch. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3601.12s)]
*  And this is helping other people. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3603.44s)]
*  Service is definitely a way to do this. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3605.32s)]
*  They can get, think about this as I mentioned earlier, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3607.72s)]
*  people don't want a flat world. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3611.7599999999998s)]
*  They want a world with depth and height to it. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3614.4s)]
*  And you can touch the depths of reality [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3616.2400000000002s)]
*  and the heights of reality. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3619.16s)]
*  And of course you can do this with mindfulness practices [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3621.48s)]
*  and other kinds of practices. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3623.96s)]
*  And this thing is I get a lot of questions, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3625.64s)]
*  people asking like, hey man, I'm in a tough spot right now. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3627.32s)]
*  I feel like there's no way out. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3629.92s)]
*  What do I do right now? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3631.92s)]
*  So that's why, and a lot of times I'll say to people, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3633.48s)]
*  try and be of service, try and help someone else. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3635.8s)]
*  It is. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3637.96s)]
*  Get out of yourself. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3638.8s)]
*  We get trapped in ourselves. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3640.12s)]
*  That's very much the case. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3642.6s)]
*  So that's what I'm thinking. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3644.36s)]
*  What other things would you recommend you think [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3645.2s)]
*  people may... [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3646.96s)]
*  Well, so let's talk about this. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3647.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about... [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3648.64s)]
*  I think this will have personal relevance to you too. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3652.04s)]
*  And if, I don't wanna push any buttons inappropriately. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3653.96s)]
*  But let's talk about when people, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3658.04s)]
*  one of the worst versions of that, which is addiction. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3660.88s)]
*  And so my friend and colleague, Mark Lewis, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3664.68s)]
*  has one of the best theories of addiction. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3667.7999999999997s)]
*  It's basically a reciprocal narrowing theory. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3670.6s)]
*  So your world is getting really problematic. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3674.2s)]
*  So you take a substance to alter your state of consciousness [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3676.88s)]
*  so that it doesn't seem to be so threatening, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3681.4s)]
*  at least for a bit. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3684.4s)]
*  The problem you pay for that [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3685.24s)]
*  is you weaken your cognitive abilities. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3686.72s)]
*  Now when you weaken your cognitive abilities, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3689.04s)]
*  your ability to solve problems in the world goes down. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3691.24s)]
*  So now the world's more threatening. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3693.04s)]
*  So now you gotta take the substance. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3694.64s)]
*  And now you gotta take more of it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3696.12s)]
*  And then you weaken your cognitive abilities more. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3697.52s)]
*  And you see what's happening? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3700.96s)]
*  The world is getting more and more oppressive. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3701.8s)]
*  Fewer and fewer options. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3703.6800000000003s)]
*  And you have less and less cognitive flexibility. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3705.32s)]
*  You have less and less ability to maneuver in your mind [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3708.28s)]
*  to change until you can't be any different [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3711.36s)]
*  and the world has no future. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3713.92s)]
*  And that's addiction. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3715.92s)]
*  You've reciprocally narrowed your way all the way, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3716.84s)]
*  yourself all the way down. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3719.5600000000004s)]
*  Now I was having dinner with Mark, lunch with Mark Lewis. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3720.88s)]
*  And I said to him, and Plato's in the back of my mind, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3723.96s)]
*  because I got this from Plato. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3726.2000000000003s)]
*  I said to Mark, I said, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3727.84s)]
*  well if you can reciprocally narrow, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3729.7999999999997s)]
*  can't you reciprocally open? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3731.3199999999997s)]
*  Can't you bring some flexibility to your mind [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3733.9199999999996s)]
*  and that opens up the world. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3737.24s)]
*  You start to see the world in more depth. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3738.3199999999997s)]
*  And then that actually opens you up [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3740.08s)]
*  into the depths of yourself and the world. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3743.04s)]
*  And you can reciprocally open. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3744.8799999999997s)]
*  It would make sense. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3746.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what Plato talked about [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3747.64s)]
*  when he talked about the myth of the cave. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3749.0s)]
*  You know, when we turned that into the movie, The Matrix. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3751.2799999999997s)]
*  So right, you can wake up. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3753.3999999999996s)]
*  You can reciprocally open up. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3756.48s)]
*  And what's important about that [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3759.04s)]
*  is that's jumping into the sky. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3761.0s)]
*  That's like, the word for that in Greek is anagoga. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3762.96s)]
*  It means ascent. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3765.92s)]
*  Like when the people are in the cave, right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3766.76s)]
*  And they ascend out into the real world. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3769.84s)]
*  And so you can open up. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3772.72s)]
*  Now what's interesting about that is, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3774.88s)]
*  like when you do that, this was Plato's great insight. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3777.12s)]
*  Three things are happening that are really, really important. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3781.0s)]
*  Two, well I'm gonna use meta again, two meta desires. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3784.48s)]
*  So in addition to whatever you desire, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3787.84s)]
*  you desire that what is satisfying your desires, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3790.04s)]
*  you have peace of mind. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3792.7200000000003s)]
*  You're not at war with yourself. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3794.32s)]
*  You're not in conflict with yourself. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3795.56s)]
*  The other is, you desire that what is satisfying [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3797.92s)]
*  in your desires is real. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3801.4s)]
*  You may say, well that doesn't seem right. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3803.08s)]
*  Well, let me give you just one clear example of this. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  So we've tried to take everything that used to be carried [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3809.7200000000003s)]
*  by God and civic and sacred religion [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3813.2000000000003s)]
*  and culture and tradition and heritage and legacy [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3816.64s)]
*  and put it into our romantic relationships. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3820.12s)]
*  They're gonna do all of that for us. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3821.8799999999997s)]
*  This is the weird messed up. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3823.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, we make someone our higher power. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3825.96s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3828.52s)]
*  And we'd say to one person, you're gonna do all that for me [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3829.48s)]
*  and they can't. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3831.8799999999997s)]
*  And so the relationships break inevitably. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3832.72s)]
*  Because our expectations were insane. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3835.3199999999997s)]
*  Your relationship shouldn't be your ultimate, right? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3836.96s)]
*  Your relationship should be nourished by what is ultimate. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3840.0s)]
*  That's a different thing, right? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3842.96s)]
*  So you ask people, I do this with my students. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3844.8s)]
*  I'll say, how many of you are in deeply satisfying [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3847.2000000000003s)]
*  romantic relationships? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3849.8s)]
*  A certain number put up their hands. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3850.88s)]
*  And I say, of the ones that have their hands up right now, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3853.6800000000003s)]
*  keep your hands up if you would wanna know [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3859.0800000000004s)]
*  if your partner was cheating on you, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3862.04s)]
*  even if that would destroy the relationship. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3863.92s)]
*  And almost all of them keep their hands up. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3865.48s)]
*  And then you ask them, well why do you keep your hands up? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3867.6800000000003s)]
*  And they said, because it's not real. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3870.48s)]
*  I want it to be real. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3873.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't want it to be a fake. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3874.08s)]
*  I don't want it to be fraud. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3875.04s)]
*  I want it to be real. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3876.08s)]
*  Now what's happening with this reciprocal opening, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3877.68s)]
*  the opposite of the addict in which everything's [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3879.72s)]
*  becoming unreal, is they're getting more and more integrated [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3881.72s)]
*  as a person. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3884.68s)]
*  The world is making more sense. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3885.64s)]
*  It's getting more real. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3887.8s)]
*  They're getting more at peace. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3889.12s)]
*  And these open. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3890.32s)]
*  Those are the two things. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3891.96s)]
*  You're satisfying those two things in a joint way. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3892.84s)]
*  And here's the third thing. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3895.08s)]
*  When you do this with a person or with reality, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3896.08s)]
*  so mutually accelerating disclosure is the technical term. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3899.52s)]
*  But if I open up to you and then you open up to me [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3903.12s)]
*  and then that enables me to open up more to you [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3906.68s)]
*  and we do this reciprocal opening with each other, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3909.24s)]
*  that's love. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3911.6s)]
*  I'm not talking about romantic love. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3913.8399999999997s)]
*  It can be friendship love. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3914.96s)]
*  So reciprocal opening gives you peace of mind, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3916.64s)]
*  gives you a deep reality, and it causes you to love. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3922.2s)]
*  That's leaping into the sky. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3925.56s)]
*  Yeah, you notice I get that a lot when I go. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3928.52s)]
*  So I go to recovery meetings. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3930.4s)]
*  So I'll go to meetings and one of the things [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3932.2s)]
*  that's nice about it is I sit in a room a lot of times [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3934.3599999999997s)]
*  and people just share what's going on with them, right? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3937.64s)]
*  And everybody just listens. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3940.48s)]
*  You just listen. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3942.2s)]
*  You don't even, no one replies to that person. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3943.04s)]
*  No one judges them. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3945.56s)]
*  No one, it's just this place where somebody can share [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3946.72s)]
*  and whatever their feelings were with that, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3950.2s)]
*  they can just be in the room and there's no, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3952.04s)]
*  you start to create this sense of comfort in people [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3955.04s)]
*  that you can share. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3958.2799999999997s)]
*  That the world is a safe place to share, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3960.12s)]
*  which probably got closed up if they were really [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3962.3199999999997s)]
*  narrowing in and isolating. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3966.4s)]
*  It's like, so this thing starts to grow [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3969.08s)]
*  and it's almost a comfort. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3971.44s)]
*  It's just a comfort that grows, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3973.64s)]
*  but then it becomes like a positive algae on other things [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3975.68s)]
*  and then everything starts to grow a little bit. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3980.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3982.2s)]
*  It really is. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3983.04s)]
*  It's expansive though. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3983.86s)]
*  It is very expansive is what it feels like. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3984.7s)]
*  And it expands out and in. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3987.04s)]
*  Is that fair to feel? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3989.08s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3989.92s)]
*  That's really what's interesting about it. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3990.84s)]
*  You're like, before you know it, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3992.36s)]
*  you're kind of feeling okay a little, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3993.72s)]
*  but it grows on itself. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3996.64s)]
*  So imagine if you're Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=3998.6s)]
*  or perhaps Socrates, and that is how you were always living. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4002.36s)]
*  The answer to the problem of nihilism is not some argument. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4007.88s)]
*  The answer is to fall in love with being, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4011.12s)]
*  with reality again in this way we're talking about. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4013.44s)]
*  And when you do that, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4015.96s)]
*  you get that vertical dimension. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4020.0s)]
*  Well, let me tell you a story. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4023.72s)]
*  So this is, Julian Barnes wrote a book, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4025.44s)]
*  The History of the World in 10 and a Half Taptors. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4028.2s)]
*  There's this one story about this guy, he dies, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4029.7999999999997s)]
*  and there's an afterlife, he goes to heaven, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4031.68s)]
*  Saint Peter's is there. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4033.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, well, do whatever you want. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4034.24s)]
*  And The Good Place made use of this, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4035.72s)]
*  but I won't do any spoilers about it. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4038.88s)]
*  But anyways, great ending, they made use of this. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4040.0s)]
*  And he wants to play, and he plays golf, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4043.52s)]
*  and he gets to the place where he can play golf [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4045.92s)]
*  absolutely the best every single day all the time, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4047.48s)]
*  then tennis, and then any painting. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4049.96s)]
*  And then after a while he comes and he's like, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4052.8s)]
*  you know, I'm kind of done. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4056.28s)]
*  And he's like, and Saint Peter goes, good, good. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4059.04s)]
*  What good? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4064.12s)]
*  The point of heaven is not for you to live forever. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4064.96s)]
*  I always think of the line from Moby Dick, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4068.08s)]
*  what is man that he should want to live out [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4069.52s)]
*  the lifetime of his God, right? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4071.12s)]
*  The point of heaven is for you to be ready to die, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4073.4s)]
*  ready to cease to be, because you're immortal. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4076.52s)]
*  You shouldn't be forever. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4078.7599999999998s)]
*  And then Stoicism is can you live now so vertically [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4080.72s)]
*  that you're ready to die? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4085.88s)]
*  Not like in some stiff upper lip, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4086.92s)]
*  we misuse the word stoic, we think it's about being stiff. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4089.52s)]
*  Stoicism is about joy, not pleasure. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4091.84s)]
*  It's about joy, it's about this vertical jump, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4094.56s)]
*  it's about this vertical, like deep depth, right? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4096.88s)]
*  Can you have such joy in this way we're talking about [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4100.24s)]
*  that you're ready to die? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4105.36s)]
*  Wow, that's a great question. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4108.0s)]
*  It's interesting, and then how would people get there? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4111.76s)]
*  And how does a man, like how do people get [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4115.04s)]
*  to that place today? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4117.84s)]
*  The responsibility, I think men are feeling [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4119.16s)]
*  a ton of responsibility right now. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4121.8s)]
*  Yes, it's very hard. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4123.679999999999s)]
*  And that's okay, it's interesting. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4124.84s)]
*  That's what's being brought on by the world and by society. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4126.28s)]
*  I think men are realizing that they have to be the, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4129.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's the ruler of their kingdom, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4133.54s)]
*  but they have to really start to step up [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4135.58s)]
*  and be a leader in their home and in their environment. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4137.74s)]
*  I think it's really, I mean for me, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4141.0199999999995s)]
*  somebody that's been of help for me is Marcus Rulius. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4143.46s)]
*  I mean, so he's a great stoic philosopher, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4147.98s)]
*  but he was also the Roman Empire. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4151.22s)]
*  He runs the whole Roman Empire. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4154.66s)]
*  He's the last and perhaps the greatest [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4155.86s)]
*  of the five good emperors. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4157.9s)]
*  And he said something that you have to really [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4159.86s)]
*  let it reverberate inside of you. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4161.78s)]
*  Because it really, he said many things. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4164.98s)]
*  If you read his, the meditation. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4167.66s)]
*  The meditation. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4169.179999999999s)]
*  He's chatty kinda. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4170.84s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4171.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4172.5s)]
*  Well, the meditations aren't written to anybody else. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4173.34s)]
*  They're actually, the Latin to him? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4174.54s)]
*  Yeah, they're written to himself. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4176.74s)]
*  So he's doing a spiritual practice. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4177.94s)]
*  And this is a practice you can do, by the way. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4179.7s)]
*  And it starts to work. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4181.58s)]
*  But one of the things he wrote to himself, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4184.0599999999995s)]
*  he said it's possible to be happy even in a palace. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4185.46s)]
*  Mm. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4189.1s)]
*  Right? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4191.1s)]
*  And that's so interesting. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4191.9400000000005s)]
*  Because you think the last sentence is gonna be [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4193.740000000001s)]
*  even in a prison or even in a desert island or something. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4195.740000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4198.660000000001s)]
*  Desert island. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4199.5s)]
*  And it's like, nope, it's possible to be happy [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4200.34s)]
*  even in a palace. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4201.660000000001s)]
*  And it's like, there's a way in which [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4203.280000000001s)]
*  all those things that are catchy but don't have depth, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4206.5s)]
*  we can learn and we can help each other. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4210.14s)]
*  Thich Nhat Hanh said the next Buddha [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4215.1s)]
*  is actually the Sangha, the community. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4216.38s)]
*  We can learn to discern through all of that [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4218.74s)]
*  and get to where we can find that vertical [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4224.26s)]
*  such that we can leap into the sky. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4228.62s)]
*  I love that, man. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4231.9400000000005s)]
*  I love that feeling when you're stuck, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4232.9800000000005s)]
*  you're painted into a corner [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4235.1s)]
*  that you can still leap into the sky. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4236.56s)]
*  There's a way to find. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4238.14s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4238.9800000000005s)]
*  Reciprocal opening. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4239.900000000001s)]
*  There's a way. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4241.3s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4242.46s)]
*  I mean, you have Marcus Aurelius on one. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4245.1s)]
*  I'm not saying, I have criticisms of Stoicism. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4247.46s)]
*  But Marcus Aurelius is an emperor. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4251.14s)]
*  Epictetus is a slave. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4253.660000000001s)]
*  The two poles, and they're both saying you can do this. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4255.46s)]
*  They're both saying at the extremes, you can find this. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4259.780000000001s)]
*  And they're not saying, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4265.14s)]
*  they're not doing it like at a Hallmark card. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4266.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4267.9800000000005s)]
*  They're like, you have to practice a lot of, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4268.820000000001s)]
*  you have to do a complex ecology of practices [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4272.66s)]
*  that you not only do by yourself, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4275.82s)]
*  but deeply with other people, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4277.82s)]
*  honed properly, and then you can make progress [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4280.26s)]
*  on doing this, what we're talking about. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4284.42s)]
*  Where did we start to lose that? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4287.94s)]
*  I mean, obviously religion was something that was big [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4289.9s)]
*  that kept people in like a common practice, right? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4292.599999999999s)]
*  That was a, and that was bigger in the past centuries, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4296.18s)]
*  I feel like, than it has been here in America. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4299.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4302.38s)]
*  And that provided a place where you would go together. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4303.3s)]
*  You would, there were certain practices [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4305.54s)]
*  that you guys did each week, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4307.4800000000005s)]
*  and there were religious get togethers, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4308.9800000000005s)]
*  and people thinking about their God, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4312.5s)]
*  and thinking with their God. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4314.780000000001s)]
*  And singing together. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4318.02s)]
*  Yes, singing together, stuff like that's powerful, man. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4319.06s)]
*  I've been in a church where people will start, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4321.22s)]
*  even in an audience with a band sometimes, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4324.18s)]
*  but it's specifically at a church sometimes, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4326.9800000000005s)]
*  people start singing. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4328.660000000001s)]
*  It's like, it'll open up, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4329.54s)]
*  it'll make you feel connected. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4332.0199999999995s)]
*  Your feelings will just start crying, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4334.0199999999995s)]
*  just start emoting, or feeling something. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4336.22s)]
*  So there's something about that, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4340.42s)]
*  doing something as a community and feeling as a group. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4342.46s)]
*  Yeah, and also there's the horizontal, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4345.82s)]
*  and like in some of the practices that we do, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4349.34s)]
*  there's the horizontal, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4353.18s)]
*  like you and I reciprocally open to each other, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4354.18s)]
*  but there's also the vertical. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4356.7s)]
*  You and I, sort of, we're not only opening this way, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4358.26s)]
*  we're opening vertically as well. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4360.860000000001s)]
*  And it's really interesting [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4363.66s)]
*  when you do some of these Socratic practices, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4364.820000000001s)]
*  dialectic into dialogos, philosophical fellowship, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4367.820000000001s)]
*  things like that. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4370.1s)]
*  People who are often not religious at all, secular, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4371.1s)]
*  they'll get into this, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4374.740000000001s)]
*  and they'll start to feel that collective flow state, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4375.58s)]
*  and that sense of reciprocally opening to each other. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4378.62s)]
*  And then they all start talking about like the third, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4381.740000000001s)]
*  the we space. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4384.900000000001s)]
*  Like the collective intelligence that neither, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4386.3s)]
*  it's not coming just from you or from me, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4389.860000000001s)]
*  but it's being co-created and emerging, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4392.22s)]
*  and taking on a life of its own. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4393.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4395.54s)]
*  And then they start to talk about this in religious language. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4396.5s)]
*  And we lost that. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4400.860000000001s)]
*  So that feels like as close as we can get to God [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4403.62s)]
*  a lot of times, I feel like. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4406.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, most people start saying things like [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4408.58s)]
*  that it might be God for them. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4411.34s)]
*  And I wanna be really careful here. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4413.02s)]
*  I'm very respectful of people's religious adherence. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4414.86s)]
*  I'm not anti-religious by any means. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4417.54s)]
*  But no, neither. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4420.46s)]
*  But people, well, what happens is, right? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4422.54s)]
*  And this is a platonic point, a neoplatonic point. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4424.9s)]
*  So what happens is initially when they're doing these, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4428.339999999999s)]
*  they get an intimacy with each other, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4431.86s)]
*  that reciprocal opening. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4433.42s)]
*  They fall in love. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4435.0599999999995s)]
*  It's phileia love. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4435.9s)]
*  But that's in the word philosophy. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4437.58s)]
*  It's fellowship love of wisdom, right? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4438.82s)]
*  They get that. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4441.7s)]
*  And then they start to feel intimate [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4442.58s)]
*  with this, the geist, the spirit. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4444.86s)]
*  We call it the logos, right? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4447.78s)]
*  This emerging collective intelligence [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4450.0199999999995s)]
*  that is making everything more intelligible. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4453.26s)]
*  And people start to reciprocally open with it, right? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4455.74s)]
*  And then they start to reciprocally open through each other [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4459.26s)]
*  and through that logos to the depths of reality. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4462.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4466.54s)]
*  And then they start to feel like they're in relationship [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4467.38s)]
*  to what is ultimate. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4470.0199999999995s)]
*  And some people think about that as God. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4472.06s)]
*  And some people think about God personally. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4477.18s)]
*  Some people think about God impersonally. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4479.34s)]
*  Some people think about it more like the ground of being [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4481.700000000001s)]
*  or ultimate reality. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4484.14s)]
*  But what everybody starts, well, all the people [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4485.5s)]
*  that talk this, what they're doing is they're trying [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4488.14s)]
*  to express a connection to something that's profoundly, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4489.9400000000005s)]
*  transformatively real and meaningful. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4495.780000000001s)]
*  And we have a word for that. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4499.46s)]
*  It's sacred to them. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4500.54s)]
*  And there's a deep connection between having [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4503.3s)]
*  a sacred canopy and the cultivation of wisdom. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4505.26s)]
*  So another thing I'll ask my students, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4507.9s)]
*  where do you go for information? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4509.58s)]
*  Without thinking, they hold up their smartphones [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4510.9s)]
*  because we're all cyborgs now, right? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4513.9s)]
*  And I say, where do you go for knowledge? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4515.98s)]
*  And they'll sort of like, oh, well, science, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4517.94s)]
*  the university, but they're- [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4520.7s)]
*  Rampa. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4521.86s)]
*  Yeah, something, right? [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4522.82s)]
*  But then I'll say, and this is where it's really interesting. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4524.66s)]
*  Where do you go for wisdom? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4527.66s)]
*  And there's an anxious silence. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4529.7s)]
*  Now, if you'd ask people that 200 years ago, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4532.46s)]
*  they'd say, oh, my church, my temple, my mosque, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4535.18s)]
*  my sangha, those answers don't come out. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4540.18s)]
*  Occasionally, very rarely, somebody will say like, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4545.74s)]
*  my church, but sometimes they'll say it kind of like, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4550.3s)]
*  but not really. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4553.58s)]
*  And what's happened is, it's most, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4555.18s)]
*  so the largest growing demographic are the nones, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4558.78s)]
*  the N-O-N-E-S, is they have no official religious identity. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4562.42s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean they're overwhelmingly atheists. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4567.219999999999s)]
*  Most of them are spiritual, but not religious, or seekers, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4569.54s)]
*  or they have weird supernatural beliefs. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4573.26s)]
*  But what's happened is, most people are abandoning religion, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4575.58s)]
*  not primarily because they've come to some deep conclusion [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4582.099999999999s)]
*  that it's false, although religion has a problem. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4585.46s)]
*  The religions generally have a problem [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4587.7s)]
*  with the scientific world view, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4588.9s)]
*  at least some versions of them. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4590.7s)]
*  But it's much more, it's a little bit of a truth issue, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4592.7s)]
*  but it's much more a relevance issue. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4596.74s)]
*  Most people feel that these institutions [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4598.5s)]
*  are no longer relevant to them. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4600.82s)]
*  They're not vibrant, they're not vital. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4604.0199999999995s)]
*  They don't speak to them. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4607.5s)]
*  They don't call them to their better self. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4608.98s)]
*  They don't call them into these experiences. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4611.38s)]
*  In fact, the ecology of practices has generally withered, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4617.22s)]
*  and we've tended to emphasize giving each other propositions [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4620.38s)]
*  and reciting them to each other, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4625.3s)]
*  as opposed to this complex set of rituals [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4626.86s)]
*  and ecologies of practices. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4630.9400000000005s)]
*  So yeah, as we lost, and I'm not, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4632.5s)]
*  and I'm not, you can put this on my tombstone, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4635.9800000000005s)]
*  neither nostalgia nor utopia. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4638.74s)]
*  I'm not saying we need to go back. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4640.5s)]
*  Right, right, no, we're just looking at it. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4642.5s)]
*  Right, we're looking at it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4644.42s)]
*  When we lost that sacred canopy, we lost a lot. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4645.62s)]
*  Nietzsche said it really well. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4650.14s)]
*  He said, he runs into the marketplace, the madman, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4651.62s)]
*  and he doesn't confront Christians. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4655.54s)]
*  He confronts the atheists, who are all sort of tittering [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4657.06s)]
*  about the death of God. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4659.42s)]
*  And he said, you don't know what, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4660.46s)]
*  and Nietzsche's the guy who pronounces the death of God, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4662.26s)]
*  so he's not there to argue against them as atheists. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4664.66s)]
*  He said, you don't realize what you've done. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4667.820000000001s)]
*  You've taken a sponge and you've wiped out the sky. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4670.74s)]
*  You've unchained us, like we're forever falling. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4674.86s)]
*  We have to become worthy of this. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4678.38s)]
*  We, like killing God, we have not, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4680.46s)]
*  like to put it in affective terms, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4683.7s)]
*  we have not grieved to the depths we need to [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4685.5s)]
*  and in a healthy way in order to be worthy of that. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4689.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what he's basically saying. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4692.7s)]
*  Well yeah, it's like if you, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4694.94s)]
*  when you take that type of thing away, right, I mean, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4695.94s)]
*  and then you take away the religion of the family, right? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4698.54s)]
*  Like a lot of families have evolved. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4702.9s)]
*  You see a lot of single parent families. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4704.9800000000005s)]
*  Both parents have to work. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4706.58s)]
*  The kids are being raised by their smartphones [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4708.860000000001s)]
*  and by whatever, the first thing you can get to them. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4713.38s)]
*  And then you take away also, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4717.3s)]
*  there was a time like in the 90s where like everything kind [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4720.38s)]
*  of like, and this is a smaller version, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4724.14s)]
*  but everything is like, you can watch or consume [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4726.1s)]
*  whatever you want when you want it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4729.1s)]
*  There used to be like, shared experiences. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4730.9400000000005s)]
*  We were called networks for a reason, right? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4734.9800000000005s)]
*  We were a network together. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4735.820000000001s)]
*  We would all watch a show and then we would go out [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4737.34s)]
*  in the street and like impersonate the characters from it. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4739.820000000001s)]
*  We would, like you were excited as soon as the show went, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4742.900000000001s)]
*  oh, it was over, especially in the summer [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4745.860000000001s)]
*  because it was still light outside. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4747.34s)]
*  We'd go outside and like impersonate our favorite acts [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4749.18s)]
*  from it, we'd all laugh and have like a shared experience. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4751.700000000001s)]
*  Whereas now everybody- [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4754.740000000001s)]
*  Is fragmented. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4756.06s)]
*  Yeah, everybody's just like watching whatever [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4756.900000000001s)]
*  when they want, it's all separate. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4759.26s)]
*  You don't really feel a connection. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4760.820000000001s)]
*  I think that's profoundly right. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4762.66s)]
*  That's what I meant earlier about how popular culture [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4764.38s)]
*  used to have a religious, religio to bind together. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4768.18s)]
*  It used to do that and now we've even lost that dimension. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4771.0199999999995s)]
*  I think- [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4776.139999999999s)]
*  Well, how do we get back from there? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4777.62s)]
*  Do we get back from there? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4779.5s)]
*  Or is this like an evolutionary time where how we meet [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4781.22s)]
*  and the things that, the glues that connect us [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4786.66s)]
*  or make us feel like part of a society [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4791.3s)]
*  or part of a universe or existence [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4794.3s)]
*  that they're just being challenged? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4798.3s)]
*  Like, I mean, they're always being challenged, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4800.22s)]
*  but do you think there's a way out of this kind of space [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4803.02s)]
*  or do you think we're in like a never before? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4806.46s)]
*  I do think there's a way out. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4809.78s)]
*  And I like, so a big chunk of my scientific work, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4811.42s)]
*  my work as a scientist is to try and figure out [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4814.820000000001s)]
*  what is this meaning making machinery? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4816.820000000001s)]
*  What is wisdom? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4818.26s)]
*  How can we get a better understanding [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4819.9s)]
*  so we can cultivate it better? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4823.179999999999s)]
*  But also working with communities of practice, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4824.259999999999s)]
*  practitioners, leaders of these communities. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4827.62s)]
*  I've done a lot of participant observation. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4829.82s)]
*  I've done a lot of participant experimentation. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4831.82s)]
*  I did a Rafe Kelly's return to the source last July. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4834.7s)]
*  Is that a series, is that a- [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4840.86s)]
*  You go out and it's an equality of practice, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4842.94s)]
*  evolve, move, play. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4845.139999999999s)]
*  He's been very influenced first by Jordan Peterson's work [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4846.379999999999s)]
*  and then more so more recently [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4850.3s)]
*  and I think he would say more in depth by my work. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4853.0199999999995s)]
*  And we'll put links to all of these things [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4856.46s)]
*  that he's mentioning and talking about. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4858.0599999999995s)]
*  We're gonna put links to those [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4859.18s)]
*  in the information on YouTube [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4860.34s)]
*  so you guys will be able to access these different things. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4862.74s)]
*  Go on, sorry. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4865.54s)]
*  And what you have is you have- [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4868.7s)]
*  Like say there's a father or mother out there, right? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4874.38s)]
*  They're in charge of their home, right? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4877.22s)]
*  And they wanna have a different future. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4879.820000000001s)]
*  They want their, you know, what do they do? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4880.9800000000005s)]
*  What do they start to do like as a person [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4884.22s)]
*  or as a leader of a home that can help? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4888.7s)]
*  Yeah, so good, good. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4891.38s)]
*  Here's the answer. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4892.9400000000005s)]
*  Sorry, I'm enthusiastic. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4895.38s)]
*  Don't misread my energy for like, I know. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4898.5s)]
*  Like I hope I have- [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4901.38s)]
*  No, look, we're waiting. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4903.06s)]
*  Okay, so like this comes from work [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4905.860000000001s)]
*  that I've done with Nathan van der Poel and other people. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4908.98s)]
*  Like I said, I've done a boat. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4911.7s)]
*  I've been in the room virtually [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4913.82s)]
*  or in person with all of the scientists [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4916.099999999999s)]
*  when we're all sat in a room and we, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4919.22s)]
*  what is wisdom and we really, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4920.82s)]
*  we produced a consensus paper. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4922.94s)]
*  And then I've done, I've go, you know, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4924.86s)]
*  lots of participant observation [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4927.5s)]
*  and we got all the, a lot of the leaders [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4929.0199999999995s)]
*  of the community together in one room [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4931.22s)]
*  and we did a bunch of discussion and practice [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4932.66s)]
*  and I'm gonna go to another one next week [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4934.94s)]
*  in France, same thing. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4938.26s)]
*  And so what's coming out of it is like, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4940.5s)]
*  there's sort of three dimensions [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4942.5s)]
*  you wanna pay attention to. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4945.0199999999995s)]
*  You wanna pay attention to view, care and action. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4946.58s)]
*  You wanna pay, remember that framing? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4949.78s)]
*  You wanna do a, you wanna really become aware [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4951.58s)]
*  of how you're framing. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4953.66s)]
*  And you wanna become really aware of that process [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4954.86s)]
*  of how you're assuming and assigning identities. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4957.94s)]
*  Stop letting all of that go on mindlessly, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4960.62s)]
*  automatically, reactively. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4962.9s)]
*  Try and, you gotta bring it more into your awareness. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4964.94s)]
*  That's view. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4969.339999999999s)]
*  Care, reciprocal opening. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4970.46s)]
*  You gotta learn how to reciprocally open. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4972.78s)]
*  How to, you know. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4975.9s)]
*  What, communicate, share information, accept information? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4977.7s)]
*  Is that what you mean by that? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4980.0599999999995s)]
*  But also reciprocally open. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4981.179999999999s)]
*  You need, one of the defining features of wisdom [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4982.5s)]
*  is an ability to take other people's perspective [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4985.339999999999s)]
*  in a way that makes a difference to how you're behaving. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4987.98s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4993.74s)]
*  You and I, right? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4995.7s)]
*  You can know that, you can know as a set of facts, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=4997.259999999999s)]
*  John's different, he thinks differently than me. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5000.5s)]
*  But you can have this kind of moment. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5003.219999999999s)]
*  Let's say it's not me. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5004.78s)]
*  Where you go, oh. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5006.179999999999s)]
*  I thought she was angry. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5010.139999999999s)]
*  But she's actually afraid. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5013.62s)]
*  You have to cultivate that kind of, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5017.5s)]
*  Daniel Siegel calls it mind sight, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5020.219999999999s)]
*  like insight into other people's minds. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5021.7s)]
*  And not just facts about their mind, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5023.46s)]
*  but the ability to get their world [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5025.9s)]
*  and where they're coming from, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5029.02s)]
*  so that you can be responsive and responsible to it. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5030.22s)]
*  You care, and then that automatically, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5034.26s)]
*  those two, you can now see why they lead [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5035.86s)]
*  to the third thing, action. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5037.34s)]
*  How are you interacting? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5038.9800000000005s)]
*  And you wanna be doing that so you can tune in [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5039.82s)]
*  to connections. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5042.66s)]
*  How are you connected to yourself? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5045.46s)]
*  How are you connected to other people? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5047.58s)]
*  How are you connected to the world? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5049.46s)]
*  And how are you connected to something ultimate [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5051.02s)]
*  that gives a verticality to your existence? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5052.86s)]
*  And then you wanna cultivate an ecology of practices [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5055.94s)]
*  in four domains. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5058.219999999999s)]
*  We call it dime. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5061.0599999999995s)]
*  You want dialogical practices, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5062.179999999999s)]
*  this dialectic into dialogus. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5063.66s)]
*  And we run workshops on that, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5065.299999999999s)]
*  and there's a whole bunch. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5066.94s)]
*  There's circling practices. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5067.86s)]
*  This is all over the place. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5069.42s)]
*  Where people are trying to get back. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5070.5s)]
*  This kind, what's happening between you and I, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5072.5s)]
*  where it takes on a life of its own. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5074.38s)]
*  And we both get to a place we couldn't get to on our own. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5075.94s)]
*  And it's emergent and it's transformative. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5078.54s)]
*  Mm, yeah. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5080.38s)]
*  Then you want the imaginal. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5081.66s)]
*  Remember we talked about the experiment? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5083.82s)]
*  You have to learn how to properly use [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5085.98s)]
*  your imagination again. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5087.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's disappearing, huh? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5089.86s)]
*  That's just an extinct animal, the imagination. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5091.66s)]
*  And we've also relegated it to something [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5093.94s)]
*  that where we're looking. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5099.099999999999s)]
*  I wanna compare two different senses of imagination. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5100.78s)]
*  One is the imaginary. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5103.74s)]
*  This is Henri Corbin. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5105.34s)]
*  He was a philosopher. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5106.58s)]
*  And that's like when you picture something in your mind. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5109.5s)]
*  Picture a sailboat. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5112.14s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5112.9800000000005s)]
*  Does it have, are the sails up or down? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5114.02s)]
*  It's in a shop. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5116.3s)]
*  Okay, so there you go. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5117.54s)]
*  Now that's one thing. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5118.54s)]
*  Now I want you to consider that in comparison to this. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5119.740000000001s)]
*  So a kid picks up a stick, ties a blanket around him, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5123.26s)]
*  and says, I'm Zorro. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5127.26s)]
*  They're not picturing anything in their mind. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5129.1s)]
*  What they're doing is they're trying to take [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5131.18s)]
*  the perspective and the identity, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5132.740000000001s)]
*  that stuff we were talking about earlier, of Zorro. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5134.46s)]
*  They're trying on what it's like to be Zorro [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5136.740000000001s)]
*  in order to see if they can catch any of his virtues. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5140.42s)]
*  That's serious play. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5145.58s)]
*  That's what you do in ritual. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5147.14s)]
*  You do that imaginally augmented awareness. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5148.3s)]
*  So when I'm teaching people Tai Chi, right, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5153.02s)]
*  and they're novices, you have to teach them [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5155.3s)]
*  how to inhabit their body differently. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5156.82s)]
*  You say to them, okay, I want you to imagine [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5158.26s)]
*  you're standing in a shallow river [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5160.18s)]
*  and your knees to your feet are sinking into the mud. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5162.74s)]
*  You wanna have that sinking feeling there. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5164.9400000000005s)]
*  Your knees to your navel are like the flowing water. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5166.98s)]
*  You want this to feel like flowing water, right? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5170.74s)]
*  And then from your navel up, this is like the air. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5173.259999999999s)]
*  You want it to feel as insubstantial as possible. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5175.259999999999s)]
*  And when people are doing that, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5177.46s)]
*  they're imaginally augmenting so they can become aware [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5178.82s)]
*  of very subtle patterns, sensory motor patterns, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5181.419999999999s)]
*  that they would otherwise be unaware of, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5184.94s)]
*  and they can re-inhabit themselves in a new way. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5187.139999999999s)]
*  And a new possibility, a new developmental pathway [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5189.339999999999s)]
*  opens for them. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5192.5s)]
*  That's the imaginal. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5193.339999999999s)]
*  And that's what ritual properly does, right? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5195.18s)]
*  So you need the dialogical, you need the imaginal, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5197.9800000000005s)]
*  you need mindfulness practices, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5200.66s)]
*  you need meditative practices and contemplative practices. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5201.9800000000005s)]
*  They're not the same thing. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5204.5s)]
*  You need siddhid versions, you need moving versions. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5205.700000000001s)]
*  You gotta create that ecology, right? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5208.26s)]
*  And then you need embodiment in practices. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5210.34s)]
*  You need practices that involve you, right, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5212.18s)]
*  knowing through your body, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5215.54s)]
*  being embedded in your environment, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5217.26s)]
*  negotiating with the world. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5219.54s)]
*  So Rafe, Kelly, you evolve, move, play. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5221.66s)]
*  You do parkour in the wilderness. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5224.38s)]
*  You get nature connection, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5226.7s)]
*  and you're also moving your body [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5228.58s)]
*  and having it be challenged. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5230.38s)]
*  So it's not a postcard that you sit back [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5232.78s)]
*  like I'm a Ney painting. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5234.54s)]
*  Oh, isn't that lovely? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5235.38s)]
*  I just really like. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5236.82s)]
*  No, it's challenging you. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5237.78s)]
*  It's forcing you to transcend. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5239.46s)]
*  When I was there, I'm like 60, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5241.3s)]
*  and I'm there with all these 20-somethings, right? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5243.22s)]
*  And like, right? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5245.42s)]
*  And I talked about every day [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5247.3s)]
*  you went to the horizon of horror. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5249.62s)]
*  And they're so good at taking you to this place [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5251.62s)]
*  where it's like, oh, I'm really scared. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5255.06s)]
*  I made a vow to myself, I said, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5257.22s)]
*  no matter what it is, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5258.9400000000005s)]
*  there's a couple things I can't do [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5259.9400000000005s)]
*  because of my many years. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5260.9800000000005s)]
*  And I said, other than those things, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5262.26s)]
*  anything that's presented to me, I'm gonna do it. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5264.780000000001s)]
*  And the more afraid I am, the more I'm gonna do it. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5266.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5269.42s)]
*  Today I have an ice bath here, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5271.5s)]
*  and I got in, I didn't really want to, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5273.7s)]
*  but I was like, I need something I just wanna alter. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5275.740000000001s)]
*  I just wanna challenge my perception today. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5277.7s)]
*  I wanna do something I don't wanna do. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5280.5s)]
*  It's something small, but it's like doing that thing [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5282.62s)]
*  that you don't wanna do, or putting yourself up, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5285.3s)]
*  just committing to it, you know? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5287.5s)]
*  Do you think we used to get so much more out of that [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5289.46s)]
*  just in our system? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5292.06s)]
*  Because if it seems like these things that you're speaking of [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5293.02s)]
*  are things that seem like necessities to our soul, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5295.38s)]
*  you know? They are. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5298.54s)]
*  Like nothing seems more thirsty these days [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5299.38s)]
*  than like our soul, like whatever. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5301.66s)]
*  There's like some, I almost can feel this part [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5303.58s)]
*  underneath me a lot of times just, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5307.66s)]
*  almost like my soul is trying to order like OxyCons [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5311.66s)]
*  or something, it's like, dude, what am I even doing here [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5316.3s)]
*  anymore if these are the practices we're doing [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5319.02s)]
*  a lot of times? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5321.22s)]
*  It's like, you can start to feel it feels bored, you know? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5322.06s)]
*  Or it feels like thirsty, that's a better word. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5326.7s)]
*  It doesn't feel bored, it feels thirsty. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5329.820000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, thirsty, but it can vacillate [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5331.820000000001s)]
*  between profound boredom and extreme anxiety. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5334.7s)]
*  Like so you get the, and by the way, thirst, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5337.5s)]
*  that's the word that's actually used [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5340.26s)]
*  in the Buddhist scriptures [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5343.42s)]
*  for what's usually translated as desire. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5344.5s)]
*  It's more like thirst and craving, it's not simple desire. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5346.94s)]
*  So yeah, and that craving, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5350.74s)]
*  it's that reciprocal narrowing, it's identifying [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5355.82s)]
*  in a mindless fact, it's all that stuff we talk about. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5358.94s)]
*  And I like the contrast, I'm playing around with it [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5362.18s)]
*  in my mind, it's like we have to learn to not thirst [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5368.06s)]
*  because we properly nourish our souls. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5371.780000000001s)]
*  And when you get people to do these four, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5374.700000000001s)]
*  like these three dimensions of you care action [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5377.780000000001s)]
*  and do Dime, you know, dialogical, imaginal, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5380.22s)]
*  mindfulness, embodied, embedded, extended, enacted, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5383.54s)]
*  all that stuff, emotional too, all the yees, right? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5386.780000000001s)]
*  And they do it not only individually [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5390.3s)]
*  but collectively, right? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5392.860000000001s)]
*  Then people start to talk about that nourishment. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5395.42s)]
*  And that nourishment, that's where the language, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5397.9400000000005s)]
*  your soul is sort of your vehicle, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5402.780000000001s)]
*  your way of being profoundly connected, right? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5404.780000000001s)]
*  Sometimes people make a distinction [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5409.1s)]
*  between your soul as sort of how you're profoundly connected [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5410.660000000001s)]
*  like to your body and you're grounded. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5414.38s)]
*  And then your spirit is how you're profoundly connected [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5417.46s)]
*  to that capacity for leaping into the sky, right? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5420.46s)]
*  And then yourself, yourself is paradoxically [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5423.14s)]
*  how you're profoundly connected to other, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5427.34s)]
*  we only become selves through other people. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5428.82s)]
*  If you're raised in isolation, you don't become a self, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5431.46s)]
*  you don't become a person. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5434.18s)]
*  We become selves, we become selves by, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5435.38s)]
*  I'm taking a perspective right now, right? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5438.46s)]
*  And you're taking a perspective on my perspective. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5440.78s)]
*  What a kid does, and this is like the Zorro, the imaginal, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5443.54s)]
*  the kid, imaginally, not imaginative, but imaginally, right? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5447.22s)]
*  The kid will try and take on the perspective [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5453.1s)]
*  of the teacher or the parent. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5454.9400000000005s)]
*  That's why, and they'll imitate them, right? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5456.9800000000005s)]
*  And eventually they can imitate them to the point, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5459.46s)]
*  they indwell that, that parent's perspective, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5462.26s)]
*  and then they imitate it more and more and more. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5465.1s)]
*  And what that means is they start to be able [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5467.860000000001s)]
*  to do that for themselves, they start to internalize that. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5469.740000000001s)]
*  And what does the parent's perspective have [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5472.46s)]
*  that the kid's perspective doesn't? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5474.820000000001s)]
*  The parent's perspective can see the biases [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5477.62s)]
*  that the kid's perspective has. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5479.379999999999s)]
*  The kid can't see it, because they're in the perspective. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5481.66s)]
*  And the parent's perspective can also see broader, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5484.379999999999s)]
*  deeper goals that the kid's perspective can't see. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5486.62s)]
*  And so, this is by Bogotsky and other people's notions, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5489.0199999999995s)]
*  by internalizing the perspective of the parent, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5491.94s)]
*  they get a capacity to take a perspective [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5495.74s)]
*  on their own perspective taking. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5497.7s)]
*  And that's how they start to become a self-aware agent. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5500.139999999999s)]
*  If you ask a three-year-old, even a three and a half-year-old, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5503.74s)]
*  what's going on in your head right now? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5506.78s)]
*  They'll say, blood, blood. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5507.98s)]
*  They can't introspect. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5509.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5511.46s)]
*  And I kept track of this with my younger son. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5512.86s)]
*  It must be bad if your father's a cognitive scientist, but. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5515.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the kid's not gonna be. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5518.78s)]
*  But I kept track of the first two times he introspected. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5521.3s)]
*  He was four and a bit, and we were driving in the car, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5525.0199999999995s)]
*  and he said, daddy, it's snowing outside, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5527.9s)]
*  but only in my head. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5530.62s)]
*  And he. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5532.62s)]
*  Oh, he's imagining it. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5533.58s)]
*  Right, and he can introspect. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5534.82s)]
*  He's got that interior imaginal space, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5537.299999999999s)]
*  because there's no literal space inside your head. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5539.139999999999s)]
*  And then the other time, as he came up to me, he said, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5541.38s)]
*  I have a backwards camera in my head. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5543.74s)]
*  And I went, what? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5545.98s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5547.179999999999s)]
*  And then I realized he was saying [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5548.78s)]
*  he has autobiographical memory. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5551.139999999999s)]
*  He can go, he can remember his past. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5552.78s)]
*  And then I, this is great, I said to him, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5555.82s)]
*  does anybody else have that? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5557.54s)]
*  And he said, no, only me. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5558.62s)]
*  Right, so we become capable of introspecting, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5559.9s)]
*  reflecting on ourselves, correcting ourselves, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5564.9s)]
*  transcending ourselves through other people. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5567.7s)]
*  We become selves through each other. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5570.179999999999s)]
*  And so the soul is perhaps, I mean, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5573.219999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to rehabilitate these terms [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5576.0199999999995s)]
*  so we can re-inhabit them, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5578.219999999999s)]
*  and there's a connection between those two words, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5579.62s)]
*  rehabilitate, re-inhabit, right? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5581.42s)]
*  I'm trying to rehabilitate the notion of soul. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5583.46s)]
*  This is how we, right, this is our deep connection [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5585.78s)]
*  to our body, right? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5588.7s)]
*  This is our deep connectedness to our embodiment, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5589.54s)]
*  to our groundedness. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5591.46s)]
*  Ourself is our deep connectedness to each other. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5592.66s)]
*  And our spirit is our deep connectedness to the vertical, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5596.5s)]
*  to what is ultimate. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5599.5s)]
*  And if we could bring those back [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5600.38s)]
*  so that they can be simultaneously, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5602.82s)]
*  scientifically understood, remember Socrates, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5604.38s)]
*  and spiritually, transformatively real for us again, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5607.82s)]
*  then we can do that nourishment you were talking about. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5611.1s)]
*  And I think it's gonna become a necessity. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5613.9s)]
*  I think- It is. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5616.22s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5617.14s)]
*  I don't know if that part of us can die, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5618.18s)]
*  the part of us that is desperate for [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5620.22s)]
*  just like this understanding or this comfort or this peace, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5627.46s)]
*  not even like the comfort of a blanket or of, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5630.700000000001s)]
*  but the comfort of just some connection [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5635.54s)]
*  to this greater energy that we're supposed to be [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5638.3s)]
*  like working with, you know? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5642.780000000001s)]
*  So we're just talking about like how [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5647.62s)]
*  that we need each other, right? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5649.58s)]
*  We need each other. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5651.780000000001s)]
*  And what's interesting I've noticed about time recently, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5653.26s)]
*  especially since like social media and the computer, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5656.5s)]
*  really the sense of smartphone is we almost, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5660.18s)]
*  I started to notice this with reality television, right? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5664.900000000001s)]
*  Like, so people would watch a show [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5667.3s)]
*  that was on reality television. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5672.820000000001s)]
*  Do they have it in Canada, reality TV? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5674.46s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5675.46s)]
*  So people would watch- [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5676.5s)]
*  We pretty much have everything you have. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5678.1s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5679.5s)]
*  Well, you don't want everything we have, so- [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5681.34s)]
*  No, no, and we also get some of the stuff [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5682.62s)]
*  that we don't wanna have, but we still get it anyways. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5684.82s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5687.14s)]
*  And I wanna apologize about that, yeah. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5687.98s)]
*  But like people were originally, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5691.22s)]
*  they would watch a reality show [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5692.78s)]
*  because the shows were like trying to capture [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5694.38s)]
*  people in their real lives behaving a certain way. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5696.78s)]
*  But then after like a generation had gone on [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5700.02s)]
*  for some of those shows that were still on- [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5702.94s)]
*  It all became bullshit, yeah. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5704.9s)]
*  Well, the people were now, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5706.620000000001s)]
*  they'd seen people behave a certain way, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5708.620000000001s)]
*  so they were now just being the characters [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5711.14s)]
*  that they'd already seen, right? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5714.9400000000005s)]
*  They went on script, yeah. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5716.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5716.860000000001s)]
*  And they don't even do it by, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5717.700000000001s)]
*  well, you couldn't really have reality TV anymore [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5721.26s)]
*  because the people that grew up watching it [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5723.54s)]
*  were now just impersonating, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5725.700000000001s)]
*  they were impersonating what they'd seen. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5727.740000000001s)]
*  So now the next contest and a generation later [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5730.34s)]
*  on these same shows were just impersonating what they, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5732.820000000001s)]
*  and I noticed it even with like trends [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5736.66s)]
*  like they'll have on social media, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5739.54s)]
*  people will be like, okay, we'll do this dance, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5741.5s)]
*  do this thing. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5743.3s)]
*  I just wonder, do we start to get in this [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5744.22s)]
*  because of the mirror of social media [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5746.9s)]
*  and of our cell phone where we're just impersonating? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5749.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5752.5s)]
*  Where we're not even, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5753.34s)]
*  like how far are we getting from like original ideas [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5755.139999999999s)]
*  and thoughts if generation over generation, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5758.0199999999995s)]
*  we just start to impersonate what we've already seen? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5760.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and that's a problem. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5763.22s)]
*  Plato actually starts worrying about that problem [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5764.74s)]
*  way back just with the invention of writing [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5766.98s)]
*  and alphabetic writing. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5769.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that happens is, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5771.34s)]
*  like Baudrillard and the, you know, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5777.66s)]
*  hyper reality, we start to get, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5780.3s)]
*  our capacity for abstract, imaginary, symbolic thought, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5783.46s)]
*  which is one of our great gifts, is also, it's adaptive. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5789.7s)]
*  So it is also something that can be a vehicle [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5793.14s)]
*  of tremendous self-deception. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5795.58s)]
*  It can cut us off in powerful ways. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5797.54s)]
*  And one of the ways in which that ability can [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5800.42s)]
*  get sort of twisted and hijacked is, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5805.700000000001s)]
*  it's an idea from Eric Fromm [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5808.820000000001s)]
*  that he got from the Stoics. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5811.780000000001s)]
*  We were talking about the Stoics earlier. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5812.860000000001s)]
*  And so, remember when I was talking about, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5815.820000000001s)]
*  you know, we're always assuming identities [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5818.58s)]
*  and assigning identities. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5821.740000000001s)]
*  And I have an agent arena relationship. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5823.82s)]
*  That's my existential mode. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5825.54s)]
*  That's the language we use for talking about that, okay? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5828.66s)]
*  When you say agent arena, what does that mean? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5831.339999999999s)]
*  That means I'm assuming a certain identity [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5832.98s)]
*  so I can act as an agent. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5835.82s)]
*  I can pursue goals, solve problems. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5838.0599999999995s)]
*  So, right, and the arena is, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5840.58s)]
*  the world makes sense and is shaped. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5842.82s)]
*  So I don't go in with a tennis racket [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5846.0199999999995s)]
*  with my tennis skills into a football stadium. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5848.9s)]
*  Right, I see what you're saying. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5851.179999999999s)]
*  Like when I go into a gas station, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5852.06s)]
*  I go in there and I'm a patron, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5854.38s)]
*  so I don't act like a police officer when I'm in there. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5856.700000000001s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5859.1s)]
*  I act like a patron in a gas station [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5859.9400000000005s)]
*  because that's what fits the world that I'm in. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5861.22s)]
*  So that's the agent in the arena. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5863.34s)]
*  And we can often forget that. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5865.02s)]
*  And so one of the personal problems I've wrestled with, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5867.38s)]
*  and I'm still wrestling with it, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5871.660000000001s)]
*  is I will tend to carry the professor persona [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5873.34s)]
*  into areas where it doesn't belong. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5876.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, I see. Right? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5878.14s)]
*  And so, that's what I mean of, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5879.46s)]
*  when we're doing it unconsciously, right? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5882.62s)]
*  Okay, so that's your existential mode [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5884.58s)]
*  when you're doing all of that. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5886.38s)]
*  Is that okay? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5887.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5888.0599999999995s)]
*  And so, Fromm talked about sort of two modes we have, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5888.9s)]
*  and the modes are both needed. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5891.82s)]
*  And they're both organized around different kinds of needs. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5895.46s)]
*  So one mode he called the having mode. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5899.34s)]
*  This is the mode in which you need to have something. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5901.099999999999s)]
*  You need to have water, you need to have oxygen. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5905.0199999999995s)]
*  And it means you need to control it, consume it, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5906.9s)]
*  and you need to have a categorical relationship with it. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5909.34s)]
*  Like water, it just has to be water. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5911.860000000001s)]
*  It doesn't have to be like this particular water. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5914.18s)]
*  It just has to be healthy water, right? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5916.62s)]
*  And so, what I do is I'm manipulating, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5918.62s)]
*  and I'm using my intelligence, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5921.5s)]
*  and I'm manipulating and controlling the world, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5922.9800000000005s)]
*  and I have what Buber would call an I-it relationship. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5925.1s)]
*  I'm only relating to this as an it, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5928.700000000001s)]
*  as a member of a category, right? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5930.5s)]
*  And that's important because, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5934.700000000001s)]
*  like if you don't have that mode, you're dead. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5936.7s)]
*  Now there's another mode. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5939.86s)]
*  He called it the being mode. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5940.9s)]
*  I'm not totally thrilled with that. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5942.139999999999s)]
*  This is the mode, these are the needs that are met [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5944.34s)]
*  not by having something, but by becoming something. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5946.86s)]
*  So you need to be mature. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5949.22s)]
*  You need to be in love. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5952.5s)]
*  Notice how we say we have sex, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5954.42s)]
*  but you wanna be in love, right? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5955.98s)]
*  And that's a different mode. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5958.54s)]
*  So in that mode, I'm not trying to control [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5960.58s)]
*  and manipulate the world. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5963.62s)]
*  I'm trying to reciprocally open it. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5964.58s)]
*  So I strive to have that relationship with my friends, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5967.38s)]
*  and most importantly with my best friend and partner, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5970.66s)]
*  Sara, right? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5973.54s)]
*  If I treated Sara like a member of a category, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5974.86s)]
*  well, Sara, the reason I'm with you is you remind me [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5977.06s)]
*  of all the other women I've been with, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5979.38s)]
*  and I know how to manipulate and control you [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5980.54s)]
*  and use you to satisfy my needs. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5982.62s)]
*  That just ended the relationship. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5984.98s)]
*  What she wants is, no, no, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5986.54s)]
*  you're not a problem that I'm gonna solve. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5988.62s)]
*  You're a mystery that I'm gonna constantly be faithful to. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5990.38s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5994.82s)]
*  And that's where I'm using not my intelligence. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5997.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm using Fromming's reason, but in Plato's sense, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=5999.94s)]
*  not in the modern logical sense. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6003.139999999999s)]
*  He means that capacity to challenge self-deception [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6004.66s)]
*  and to try and reciprocally open with something. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6008.54s)]
*  So those are your being needs, right? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6011.5s)]
*  And those are important too. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6014.299999999999s)]
*  And you need both, right? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6015.9s)]
*  Because you wanna have water and you wanna be mature. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6017.66s)]
*  You want food and you wanna be honest, right? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6020.459999999999s)]
*  The problem we get, Fromm says, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6024.66s)]
*  especially if we're not paying attention [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6026.74s)]
*  to our existential mode, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6029.46s)]
*  is we will pursue the needs in the wrong frame. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6031.34s)]
*  So for example, being need, maturity. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6035.86s)]
*  Instead of, I'm gonna become mature, I'm gonna have a car. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6040.5s)]
*  Instead of being in love, I'm gonna have lots of sex. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6044.58s)]
*  Mm, I see, right? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6047.139999999999s)]
*  And this is modal confusion. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6049.0599999999995s)]
*  Your existential modes are confused. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6050.82s)]
*  And when that happens, we confuse. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6053.54s)]
*  So, quantity on equality, kind of. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6056.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6059.22s)]
*  Kind of a blanket statement, but. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6060.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6061.700000000001s)]
*  So, let's back to your point. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6062.54s)]
*  Social media, what you want is you have a being need. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6064.1s)]
*  You need to be in relationship with people, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6068.22s)]
*  but now you have connections. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6071.26s)]
*  You need to be real, but now you have a script. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6074.46s)]
*  Do you see what keeps happening? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6078.54s)]
*  What happens, and Fromm's point is, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6079.900000000001s)]
*  our culture, right, is largely, he called it, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6083.7s)]
*  like, Fromm's a Marxist, I'm not a Marxist, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6088.7s)]
*  but he called it the market character, right? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6091.419999999999s)]
*  He said, what happens is, we are increasingly led [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6094.5s)]
*  to trying to pursue not only our having modes, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6100.5s)]
*  but all of our being needs from within the having mode, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6104.299999999999s)]
*  because if I can get you to pursue your being needs [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6107.339999999999s)]
*  within the having mode, I can sell you stuff. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6109.78s)]
*  I can sell you stuff, I can sell you ideas. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6112.0199999999995s)]
*  I can manipulate you with political ideas. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6114.0599999999995s)]
*  So, there's a lot to be gained by bullshitting you, right? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6116.459999999999s)]
*  Constantly keeping you with salience, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6120.379999999999s)]
*  but you don't ever pursue the truth [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6123.86s)]
*  of what your needs really are, right? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6125.379999999999s)]
*  But constantly giving you the salience and drawing you in. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6127.98s)]
*  But there's, we benefit that in a way, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6132.179999999999s)]
*  because if I continue to bite at the fool's gold bait, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6134.299999999999s)]
*  of those types of things, if I continue to, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6139.5s)]
*  it keeps me away from really having to look at myself. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6142.38s)]
*  So, because it can be very painful to really sit [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6145.820000000001s)]
*  and look at myself and my history and my past [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6150.06s)]
*  if I'm not doing it in a loving way, in an accepting way. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6152.820000000001s)]
*  And think about how that's made even worse. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6156.38s)]
*  That's astute what you just said. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6158.820000000001s)]
*  So, there's an outer dimension of how we're being misled, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6160.7s)]
*  and then there's the inner dimension of how we're avoidant. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6163.7s)]
*  And think about how hard it is for you to convince [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6165.900000000001s)]
*  and to confront pain if you don't have a sacred canopy [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6168.98s)]
*  and a call to use a practice [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6172.099999999999s)]
*  that can give meaning to the pain. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6173.58s)]
*  People can undergo tremendous pain [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6174.98s)]
*  if it is made meaningful to them. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6177.94s)]
*  I'm working with somebody right now, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6179.66s)]
*  she's done interventions around pain management. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6181.459999999999s)]
*  And like people, think about, here, let me give you a reason. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6184.299999999999s)]
*  So, what are the things people, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6190.259999999999s)]
*  oh, I want money and I wanna feel comfortable, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6191.219999999999s)]
*  I wanna feel sort of good, I want good sleep, good health, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6193.54s)]
*  I want my partner and I to get along really well. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6197.34s)]
*  You know what will destroy all of those? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6200.02s)]
*  Have a kid. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6202.06s)]
*  Have a child. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6203.74s)]
*  Your health goes down, your finances go down, right? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6204.82s)]
*  You're sick all the time, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6207.9400000000005s)]
*  you're wet for some reason all the time, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6208.900000000001s)]
*  there's alarms going off, you don't sleep. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6210.38s)]
*  Each partner's convinced the other one's [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6212.14s)]
*  not doing enough work. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6215.26s)]
*  And you ask people, why do you do that? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6216.1s)]
*  Why do you give up on all of those things? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6218.78s)]
*  And they'll say, because having a kid is so meaningful. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6221.5s)]
*  Remember, I'm connected to something [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6224.34s)]
*  that has a reality and a value beyond my egocentric [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6226.26s)]
*  concerns, I want it to exist even if I don't [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6229.860000000001s)]
*  and I wanna care for it, I wanna make a difference to it. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6232.26s)]
*  And it's magical. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6235.22s)]
*  If you love a child, you turn this being, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6236.7s)]
*  I mean, they're morally people right from the beginning, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6241.66s)]
*  but cognitively, they're not people. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6243.66s)]
*  And it's like magic, you love them [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6245.5s)]
*  and they turn into persons. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6248.34s)]
*  Right, and like it's just, right? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6249.86s)]
*  And so, when people can go, they will sacrifice a lot [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6251.66s)]
*  if they have a reasonable hope that there'll be meaning [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6256.3s)]
*  in it, but if we're in a meaning crisis [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6259.7s)]
*  and meaning scarcity, they won't make any of those [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6261.78s)]
*  sacrifices, they won't face pain. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6264.5s)]
*  Don't tell somebody face your pain, feel your emotions, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6266.54s)]
*  if they can't bring meaning to it, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6269.58s)]
*  if they can't have practices to confront it [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6271.34s)]
*  and bring wise discernment. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6273.82s)]
*  So you're right, it makes it even worse. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6275.26s)]
*  So not only are they being bullshitted from without, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6277.3s)]
*  they're being starved, your nourishment metaphor, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6279.9800000000005s)]
*  they're being starved within of the meaning [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6282.7s)]
*  that would allow them to make that confrontation. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6284.78s)]
*  And you're right, those two things feed on each other [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6287.38s)]
*  and we get really, reciprocally narrow, [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6289.860000000001s)]
*  we get really bound into this profound modal confusion. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6292.02s)]
*  And like you said, it's fool's gold, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6295.06s)]
*  it's not actually satisfying it. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6296.42s)]
*  So we pursue, I need more cars, I need more sex, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6298.06s)]
*  I need more drugs, whatever it is, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6300.5s)]
*  and then we get lost in a profound way. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6302.06s)]
*  Well, we're at the end of the line with it, it feels like, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6304.7s)]
*  I mean, we're watching, there's television shows [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6306.7s)]
*  called American Greed. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6309.34s)]
*  It's like, we're sitting here watching the, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6311.0599999999995s)]
*  we're watching like every hero becomes a villain [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6314.179999999999s)]
*  because they fall to their own devices of addictions [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6317.42s)]
*  or small things, whatever little things that they let fester [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6322.26s)]
*  while they were trying to achieve grandeur. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6325.58s)]
*  It's like, we're just realizing that there's no, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6329.0199999999995s)]
*  I think the avenue of this capitalistic, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6333.74s)]
*  I don't know what it is, I can't figure out what it is [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6338.139999999999s)]
*  that's let us so astray though sometimes. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6341.0599999999995s)]
*  But I think we are as a group are realizing [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6344.42s)]
*  that we are astray, it feels like. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6347.7s)]
*  I think so too, and Fromm predicted, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6350.82s)]
*  he predicted that eventually, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6353.3s)]
*  he made the argument that when we're in profound modal [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6356.42s)]
*  confusion, what we would eventually do, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6359.099999999999s)]
*  and he was part of the person that inspired me [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6361.62s)]
*  when I made that prediction I talked about earlier, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6363.02s)]
*  is we will seek the last connection we have with reality, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6365.700000000001s)]
*  which is violent destructiveness. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6369.5s)]
*  If I can't connect to it, the last connection I can have [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6371.34s)]
*  is at least I will be the one that destroys it. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6374.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6376.22s)]
*  Really? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6378.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6379.22s)]
*  Think of movie Joker, right, and just that movie's, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6380.780000000001s)]
*  it's almost like a hymn to that. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6384.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, think of, look at people walking into schools [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6386.5s)]
*  and shooting, that's a symptom of the meaning crisis. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6389.5s)]
*  Look at suicide, look at, we had a coroner on, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6391.9s)]
*  and he was saying the number one cause of death [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6395.54s)]
*  in black communities is gun violence, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6397.46s)]
*  the number one cause of death in white communities [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6399.94s)]
*  is overdosing. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6401.94s)]
*  It's like people are just finding a mean, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6403.66s)]
*  it feels like we're in a cul-de-sac. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6408.299999999999s)]
*  See. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6411.099999999999s)]
*  Of hope in a way. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6412.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6413.46s)]
*  We're in a place where we're really, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6414.78s)]
*  we're narrowed down, we're locked in, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6418.26s)]
*  but like I said, there's also, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6422.18s)]
*  those are all the negative symptoms. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6424.34s)]
*  Right, right, and I know, and I hate to be, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6425.62s)]
*  I don't wanna try to be too negative either. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6427.58s)]
*  No, there's positive symptoms too, right? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6429.54s)]
*  And like if you look, I'm just using an analogy, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6431.7s)]
*  if you look at a disease, you look not at only [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6434.14s)]
*  the negative symptoms, you look at how the body's [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6435.820000000001s)]
*  trying to heal itself, how it's trying to repair, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6437.62s)]
*  because that might give you hope, rational hope, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6440.1s)]
*  for how you could actually cure the disease. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6443.18s)]
*  You see other things happening. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6445.06s)]
*  And even in those things, you'll see the mixture. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6447.1s)]
*  So the mindfulness revolution is, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6449.42s)]
*  I think I was the first person to teach [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6452.54s)]
*  about mindfulness academically [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6454.54s)]
*  at the University of Toronto, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6455.860000000001s)]
*  and I had to sort of introduce it [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6456.700000000001s)]
*  within the middle of another lecture, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6458.26s)]
*  and just talk about mindfulness. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6460.14s)]
*  There's actually a lot of experimental work, right? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6461.34s)]
*  Now everybody talks about it, there's journals, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6463.42s)]
*  but the mindfulness revolution is an attempt [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6466.26s)]
*  to start bringing back the cultivation. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6468.1s)]
*  Now, it's also getting commodified. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6470.660000000001s)]
*  We have what's now called mic-mindfulness. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6473.06s)]
*  Mindfulness, if you look in the cultures, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6475.02s)]
*  like if you look in Buddhist cultures, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6477.860000000001s)]
*  or you even look back into Christian neoplatonism, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6479.02s)]
*  the monastic traditions, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6482.02s)]
*  mindfulness is this rich ecology of practices. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6483.660000000001s)]
*  There's meditative practices, contemplative practices, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6486.34s)]
*  there's siddha practices, there's all this. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6490.18s)]
*  And then what we did is we took one practice, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6493.38s)]
*  meditation, siddha meditation, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6495.740000000001s)]
*  and we said, that's all mindfulness is. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6498.860000000001s)]
*  And then we took it out of that rich thing. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6500.9400000000005s)]
*  We took it out of the broader framework [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6502.42s)]
*  of ethical practices and philosophical practices. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6504.139999999999s)]
*  So it's not about transforming you in the world, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6506.86s)]
*  it's about making you contented [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6508.94s)]
*  with being a corporate drone, right? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6510.86s)]
*  And so, but still, there's a positive, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6513.62s)]
*  you see what I mean? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6516.339999999999s)]
*  There's a positive and negative in there. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6517.179999999999s)]
*  The stoicism is going through a huge revival right now, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6518.379999999999s)]
*  right? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6521.5s)]
*  There's a revival of interest [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6522.339999999999s)]
*  in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6524.82s)]
*  because I think one of the reasons, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6526.94s)]
*  I've had great conversations with both Jonathan Pageau [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6528.54s)]
*  and Bishop Maximus, both good friends of mine, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6530.9s)]
*  because Eastern Orthodox Christianity has the imaginal in it [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6534.66s)]
*  and has neoplatonism in it. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6538.459999999999s)]
*  So imagine if you took Plato and Aristotle and the Stoics [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6540.54s)]
*  and you integrated them together, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6545.179999999999s)]
*  so not only was it a great philosophical system, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6546.54s)]
*  it was a profound ecology of practices. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6550.099999999999s)]
*  That's neoplatonism, and that's what's coming back. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6551.98s)]
*  I consider myself a neoplatonist, right? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6554.66s)]
*  And so there's lots of, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6556.78s)]
*  there's all these dialogical communities emerging. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6558.7s)]
*  There's things like Rafe's Evolve, Move, Play. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6561.299999999999s)]
*  There's Guy Sandstock's Circling. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6564.06s)]
*  There's the work that Taylor Barrett does, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6565.42s)]
*  all the stuff we're doing, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6567.54s)]
*  and we're just one amongst many. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6568.7s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's interesting to hear people, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6570.62s)]
*  yeah, people are thirsty for something. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6574.1s)]
*  They're thirsty for something new, I think. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6576.7s)]
*  Or they're just a new being [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6579.82s)]
*  and they're thirsty for something. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6581.5s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6583.38s)]
*  And Plato had this weird thing where he said, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6584.34s)]
*  you don't really learn, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6586.26s)]
*  you're just always remembering something [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6587.22s)]
*  you didn't know, but you did know. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6588.62s)]
*  And people have sort of struggled with this, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6590.78s)]
*  but here's something that people say [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6593.7s)]
*  when we're doing the dialectic and the dialogos [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6595.0599999999995s)]
*  or the philosophical fellowship. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6597.26s)]
*  They'll say things like, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6599.22s)]
*  that's a form of intimacy I never knew about, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6602.099999999999s)]
*  but I realized I've always been looking for. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6605.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what they say, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6608.66s)]
*  and that's so paradoxical to hear, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6609.5s)]
*  but when you're in it, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6612.0199999999995s)]
*  you understand perfectly what they're talking about. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6612.86s)]
*  They broke that modal confusion. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6616.74s)]
*  They break through it. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6619.18s)]
*  Dirk Brooke, you know, Meister Eckhart, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6620.14s)]
*  they break through it, right? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6622.14s)]
*  He's a Christian Neoplatonist. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6623.860000000001s)]
*  They break through, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6624.900000000001s)]
*  and they break through the modal confusion. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6626.38s)]
*  And so they were hungry for it, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6628.38s)]
*  but their framing hadn't been well. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6630.18s)]
*  That's one of the things I love about going [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6632.26s)]
*  to a lot of different recovery meetings. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6633.740000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you sit in there, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6635.42s)]
*  you're just waiting for somebody to say something [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6636.58s)]
*  the way that you have always wanted to say it, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6640.34s)]
*  but you couldn't put the seven or eight words together. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6643.900000000001s)]
*  Isn't that a gift when that happens? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6646.02s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6648.1s)]
*  And I'll go three or four times a week [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6650.1s)]
*  just hoping to hear one guy say something, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6651.900000000001s)]
*  and I will literally feel like my body will do that. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6654.780000000001s)]
*  And you can hear someone's here, [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6659.3s)]
*  other people in the room. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6660.46s)]
*  It's almost like a collective sigh. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6661.54s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6664.42s)]
*  Yes, that's the embodiment, right? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6665.820000000001s)]
*  And that's the soul, right? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6668.06s)]
*  And there's also the spirit. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6669.700000000001s)]
*  You're both getting to a place [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6670.900000000001s)]
*  you couldn't get to on your own. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6672.14s)]
*  And I'm gonna use this word, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6673.620000000001s)]
*  and I mean it positively, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6674.900000000001s)]
*  and I'm not trying to slay you, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6677.18s)]
*  but those recovery meetings, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6678.700000000001s)]
*  I've attended AA and some other things, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6682.9400000000005s)]
*  and many of them explicitly at least [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6686.54s)]
*  were born in a religious framework, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6688.46s)]
*  but they're religious practices [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6690.34s)]
*  in the way we've been talking about. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6691.860000000001s)]
*  You're cultivating wisdom and transformation, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6692.900000000001s)]
*  how to face yourself, how to cultivate connection, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6695.46s)]
*  and you're doing it individually and collectively. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6699.54s)]
*  And yes, and I notice [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6703.22s)]
*  this is an observation, it's not a criticism. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6707.820000000001s)]
*  You keep returning to this as a lived example, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6710.34s)]
*  in your body lived example of what we're talking about. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6714.26s)]
*  Right? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6717.26s)]
*  But what I'm asking you to now consider is [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6718.1s)]
*  there's lots of variations on this theme [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6720.860000000001s)]
*  that are arising everywhere, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6724.700000000001s)]
*  and they're getting scientific understanding, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6726.34s)]
*  they're networking into a subculture, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6728.5s)]
*  and that gives me rational hope. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6731.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6735.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think it's the thing, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6736.1s)]
*  like when things get bad, they're always, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6738.26s)]
*  throughout time it seems like there's always been like, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6741.02s)]
*  in every story, there's the moment [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6747.900000000001s)]
*  where you think things are, where things get bad, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6750.700000000001s)]
*  and they get good. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6753.620000000001s)]
*  It's like, it's that feeling inside of you [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6754.780000000001s)]
*  that this has to end well. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6757.14s)]
*  I think that little pilot light of that, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6759.14s)]
*  it feels like it perseveres no matter what. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6763.38s)]
*  Well, it can get blown out. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6768.18s)]
*  We do some work with, I agree with you about that pilot light. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6770.820000000001s)]
*  By the way, think of it not just as a pilot light, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6773.78s)]
*  but like what a pilot used to be, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6776.02s)]
*  or a pilot of an airplane, or a pilot of a ship. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6777.62s)]
*  It's a guiding light, right? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6780.02s)]
*  Well, I think it's not even my own pilot light, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6781.42s)]
*  but I think it's the collective pilot light. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6783.9400000000005s)]
*  That's the one that I feel like wins in the end. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6786.5s)]
*  I don't know if us as individuals, if we win. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6789.5s)]
*  That's an excellent distinction, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6792.34s)]
*  because we're doing some work myself, [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6793.58s)]
*  and some of my colleagues, graduate students, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6795.54s)]
*  of vets who have post-traumatic stress disorder. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6798.5s)]
*  And their internal light, in some sense, been blown out. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6801.5s)]
*  But I like what you said. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6806.3s)]
*  One of the things we're trying to do is see [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6807.66s)]
*  if they can catch it from each other. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6809.18s)]
*  Mm. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6811.06s)]
*  And try and bring about interventions [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6812.9400000000005s)]
*  that can bring that about. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6814.42s)]
*  So, remember I mentioned Paul Tillich, the courage to be, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6816.22s)]
*  there's a Greek word for this, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6818.900000000001s)]
*  and it's from the Christian tradition. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6819.9400000000005s)]
*  It's kairos, and it means the right timing, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6822.740000000001s)]
*  the time where the course of things turns. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6826.14s)]
*  And the kairos is always a place [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6830.54s)]
*  in which multiple opportunities. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6832.9400000000005s)]
*  So, like, you know, the Bronze Age collapsed. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6835.9400000000005s)]
*  Civilizations can collapse, too, right? [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6839.740000000001s)]
*  And so, yeah, we're at this very crucial time. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6841.860000000001s)]
*  Now, it's a dangerous time, but the advantage of a kairos [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6844.9800000000005s)]
*  is, okay, when everything is going really well, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6849.54s)]
*  a system is really stable, and it has a lot of inertia, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6851.38s)]
*  and it's hard to make a difference. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6854.38s)]
*  But when things are breaking up, [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6855.860000000001s)]
*  this is called self-organizing criticality, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6857.14s)]
*  then individuals can make a difference [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6859.18s)]
*  that they can't normally make when things, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6860.900000000001s)]
*  so don't look at, like, well, things have always been [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6863.14s)]
*  this way, because if we're actually in a crisis, a kairos, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6865.82s)]
*  then your capacity as an individual to make a difference [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6869.38s)]
*  has been increased. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6872.38s)]
*  Wow, man, that's awesome. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6873.22s)]
*  You know, that's really awesome, man, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6875.54s)]
*  and that's something that I think, yeah, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6876.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm grateful to hear that today, you know? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6878.5s)]
*  And I think, and not to give us the insight [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6880.7s)]
*  that we are gods or that we, but just that you can, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6883.22s)]
*  this is, never has the road been set more [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6886.22s)]
*  when you can have an impact, you know? [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6888.94s)]
*  Because that's just the way that the chips are stacked, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6891.34s)]
*  so what a blessing for you to be able [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6893.5s)]
*  to have an impact right now. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6895.94s)]
*  If you do something good, if you do something positive, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6897.34s)]
*  if you choose to take the road that builds up your self-worth [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6899.74s)]
*  more than the just feeling good in the moment, you know? [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6905.38s)]
*  That's inspiring, man. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6911.66s)]
*  When you think of, like, what about love? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6913.58s)]
*  Like, people look at love a lot, you know? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6917.42s)]
*  Have you been in love before? [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6919.66s)]
*  I'm in love right now. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6921.3s)]
*  Okay, so you have a partner now and you all have children? [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6922.18s)]
*  No, I have children from a previous marriage. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6925.42s)]
*  She has children from a previous marriage, and we're done. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6929.62s)]
*  We've raised children, her two children are adults, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6932.38s)]
*  my two children are now adults. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6937.139999999999s)]
*  Okay, but you've had children now. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6939.34s)]
*  Yeah, and there's, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6941.700000000001s)]
*  But I am in love now, and I also love my kids, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6946.900000000001s)]
*  I love my friends, but I've also been learning [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6956.02s)]
*  to love the world and reality and being. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6959.9800000000005s)]
*  And in that sense, like agape, you know, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6965.3s)]
*  the love that makes us, like we were talking about earlier, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6967.98s)]
*  the love that turns us into human beings. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6969.98s)]
*  You know, the Bible, I'm not a Christian, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6971.74s)]
*  but the Bible says, you know, God is agape, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6973.339999999999s)]
*  like finding that reciprocal opening, that sacredness, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6976.339999999999s)]
*  finding the deep connections between logos, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6979.5s)]
*  that spirit of making sense of things [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6982.099999999999s)]
*  that emerges between people, the agape [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6984.419999999999s)]
*  by which we make each other into people, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6986.58s)]
*  but it also connects us deeper to reality. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6988.339999999999s)]
*  The deep within is calling to the deep without, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6990.9s)]
*  and they call to each other. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6993.94s)]
*  I'm in love with all of that. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6995.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6997.26s)]
*  Did you, do you think that? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=6998.62s)]
*  Theo, I think if you ask me in the elevator, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7003.74s)]
*  John, you have 20 seconds. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7006.74s)]
*  This is what I would say, learn to love wisely. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7010.14s)]
*  That's it. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7014.5s)]
*  Like it's really hard. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7016.38s)]
*  Most of my failings have become that I did not love wisely. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7019.42s)]
*  I love foolish, I think you could understand sin [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7023.54s)]
*  as a failure to love wisely. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7026.1s)]
*  Sorry, I interrupted you, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7030.3s)]
*  but I just wanted to express that. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7031.14s)]
*  No, I appreciate you expressing that. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7032.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think I've done that a lot of times. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7034.900000000001s)]
*  I think sometimes there's things that are easier to love, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7037.26s)]
*  and it's not even love. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7040.46s)]
*  It's like a lust even of your imagination. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7042.42s)]
*  Or even if you can, anything can lust. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7044.9800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't have to be just like of your groin [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7047.22s)]
*  or whatever, you know. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7049.820000000001s)]
*  It can be of any, you can. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7051.14s)]
*  Fame. Fame. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7053.42s)]
*  Yeah, fame, food, sugar. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7054.74s)]
*  Yeah, I went through that. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7057.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7058.74s)]
*  Oh God, dude, I eat a whole bag of damn Dove dark chocolates. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7059.94s)]
*  And I'll do it again sometimes. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7064.66s)]
*  I miss the chocolate. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7066.34s)]
*  It's one of the things I had to give up [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7067.26s)]
*  when I was diagnosed with diabetes. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7068.54s)]
*  Oh God, dude, they get you. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7069.9s)]
*  Yeah, how crucial is that to people, [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7073.94s)]
*  to the success of their survival, do you think? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7076.34s)]
*  Love? [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7080.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean, again, lust is when we're pursuing love [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7081.46s)]
*  from the having mode. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7088.66s)]
*  Right, okay. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7090.02s)]
*  So you need to have sex. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7091.26s)]
*  I mean, we got into the mistake of thinking, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7095.3s)]
*  no, no, we don't need that, and that messes people up. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7096.86s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7100.14s)]
*  And then we do the other thing. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7101.1s)]
*  No, no, no, no, you'll get love by just having lots of sex, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7102.22s)]
*  and now we're in that, the other, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7106.46s)]
*  we're going the other way. Oh, that's heartbreaking. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7108.66s)]
*  Right, and so, I mean, love is, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7109.9s)]
*  the thing is, we're really confused. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7115.259999999999s)]
*  First of all, love isn't a feeling. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7116.86s)]
*  I'm in love with Sara right now, [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7121.339999999999s)]
*  and until I mentioned those words, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7122.9s)]
*  I wasn't feeling anything. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7124.46s)]
*  Right. Right? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7125.66s)]
*  Love isn't an emotion. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7126.5s)]
*  I'm in love with Sara, and sometimes that makes me sad. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7128.339999999999s)]
*  I miss her right now a lot, right? [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7131.46s)]
*  Sometimes it makes me angry. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7133.98s)]
*  You're threatening Sara. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7135.78s)]
*  No, you're not gonna do that, right? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7137.379999999999s)]
*  And sometimes it makes me really happy. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7139.38s)]
*  Sometimes it makes me very thoughtful. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7141.66s)]
*  Oh, I just realized I really don't know her, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7143.14s)]
*  and that's wonderful. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7146.7s)]
*  So love isn't even an emotion. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7147.82s)]
*  Love is an existential stance. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7149.34s)]
*  It's, I am, you and I, we're gonna religio, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7151.9800000000005s)]
*  we're gonna bind ourselves so we reciprocally open, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7155.22s)]
*  so you draw the best out in me, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7158.5s)]
*  I draw the best out in you, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7161.1s)]
*  you transcend yourself through me, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7162.66s)]
*  and I transcend myself through you, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7164.78s)]
*  and we keep realizing that that is such amazing mystery [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7166.54s)]
*  that keeps happening, we're gonna be faithful to it. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7170.54s)]
*  It's a commitment. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7173.02s)]
*  Yeah. It's a commitment. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7174.22s)]
*  But it's not a commit, like the Greeks had, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7175.58s)]
*  the Greeks- But it's not a prison. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7178.1s)]
*  No, and the Greeks have two words, right? [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7179.3s)]
*  There's inkratia, like democracy, inkratia power. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7182.74s)]
*  So inkratia is when you commit by like, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7186.22s)]
*  I'm not gonna eat the chocolate, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7189.26s)]
*  or I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7191.58s)]
*  I'm not gonna do it, that's inkratia. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7192.86s)]
*  Saffron, Saffron is different. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7194.74s)]
*  Saffron's like this. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7197.38s)]
*  Saint Paul talks about when he does the hymn to agape, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7199.5s)]
*  when I was a child, I thought like a child, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7201.54s)]
*  I acted like a child, but then when I became an adult, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7203.86s)]
*  I put childish things behind me, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7207.0599999999995s)]
*  as the child is to the adult, the adult is to the sage. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7208.7s)]
*  So when you're a kid, you have two gods, candy and toys. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7211.94s)]
*  In fact, one of the greatest things I did philosophically [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7216.3s)]
*  with my younger son is I came to him one day and I said, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7218.38s)]
*  which is more important, toys or candy? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7222.66s)]
*  And he looked at me like, finally dad is asking me [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7225.86s)]
*  something intelligent. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7228.74s)]
*  And he even said, like he even did like, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7230.0199999999995s)]
*  give me a moment, I wanna think, right? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7232.0199999999995s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7233.78s)]
*  And then he came back to me and he said, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7234.66s)]
*  toys, cause you can get sick of candy. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7237.0599999999995s)]
*  And I thought, ah, that's my son. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7239.3s)]
*  There's a philosopher in there somewhere, right? [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7241.0199999999995s)]
*  And so, right, but notice what, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7243.38s)]
*  and I used to play with him all the time, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7245.3s)]
*  and it's a weird thing when you're an adult, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7246.82s)]
*  cause like, I remember one of my friends told me, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7248.139999999999s)]
*  he remembered the day when the toys died, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7250.26s)]
*  because what happens is when you're a kid, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7252.9800000000005s)]
*  toys are super salient to you, right? [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7256.26s)]
*  My son, when he was young, he used to have like a toy tower [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7260.06s)]
*  where all the MC figurines are there and everything. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7262.22s)]
*  Like to get him to, he would forgo urinating and eating [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7265.06s)]
*  to play, right, with his toys, right? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7268.22s)]
*  Now I would play with him, but I don't have that, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7271.34s)]
*  because I hope, I'm an adult, I'm a man, [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7273.820000000001s)]
*  and I don't have to sort of resist. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7276.34s)]
*  I don't have to go, no, I won't play with the toys. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7277.7s)]
*  No, I won't play, I've matured what I find salient, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7280.46s)]
*  we call that a salient's landscape. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7284.14s)]
*  I've matured what I find salient, how I connect to things. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7285.86s)]
*  And salient means just to make it clear. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7288.3s)]
*  How things grab your attention, how they stand out for you, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7289.78s)]
*  how they catch you, right? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7292.18s)]
*  And so, like, I know logically I could pick up the toys [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7293.66s)]
*  and play the, this is Mark, but it doesn't draw me. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7298.14s)]
*  See, sopherson, that's sopherson. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7302.14s)]
*  You want to commit, not emcratically, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7305.38s)]
*  I'm not gonna cheat on my partner. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7308.54s)]
*  You want to commit sopherson. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7310.42s)]
*  It's like I'm constantly tempted by the good. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7313.46s)]
*  I'm constantly flowing. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7316.3s)]
*  It comes like second nature to me to have this commitment. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7318.38s)]
*  Like, Frankfurt called love a voluntary necessity, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7322.26s)]
*  which is a brilliant way of putting it. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7326.74s)]
*  See what I mean, because we have, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7328.38s)]
*  the problem we have is we can, [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7331.34s)]
*  and this messes people up. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7335.74s)]
*  This is why I wanted to speak to this. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7339.18s)]
*  People, I think commitment's the right word. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7340.14s)]
*  The problem is we often, when we hear commitment, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7342.5s)]
*  we think of duty, and then we fall into a cradia, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7344.82s)]
*  and we, I'm gonna force myself to stay with this person. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7347.18s)]
*  Now, you have to tough it out at times, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7350.34s)]
*  but in the end you want to mature in a relationship [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7352.22s)]
*  so that the commitment is sopherson, right? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7355.58s)]
*  So it's- [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7359.02s)]
*  It's reciprocal. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7359.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it's opening, and you're being drawn into it [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7360.7s)]
*  rather than forcing yourself. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7363.18s)]
*  It's like when you're meditating. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7365.18s)]
*  Initially you're sort of constantly trying [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7366.7s)]
*  to keep your attention on the breath, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7368.78s)]
*  and it's like concentrate, like the word, [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7370.3s)]
*  you're forcing things into the center, right? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7371.94s)]
*  But what you get is you get to where it flips, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7373.98s)]
*  and instead of doing that, you're constantly, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7376.18s)]
*  instead of being re-interested and being drawn into [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7378.5s)]
*  what you're focusing your attention on, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7382.0199999999995s)]
*  entering the stream, as they talk about. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7383.42s)]
*  You want to enter the stream in your, [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7385.78s)]
*  love it, like infatuation is the momentary madness [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7388.22s)]
*  that gives us a foretaste that we can properly play with [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7392.74s)]
*  of how that can happen. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7395.54s)]
*  But the problem is we can't stay in infatuation. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7396.86s)]
*  You have to, what infatuation does is it says, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7399.58s)]
*  okay, see how you could get into this reciprocal opening [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7402.58s)]
*  with somebody? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7405.82s)]
*  Now this is candy, find out how to make it food, basically. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7406.66s)]
*  That's the other problem we have in our culture. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7411.54s)]
*  The romantic comedies have told us that the most important, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7413.58s)]
*  not only do they tell us that this weird bullshit story [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7416.86s)]
*  that the universe will conspire to bring you [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7420.7s)]
*  the person you should be with, no it won't. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7422.42s)]
*  Yeah, the universe is not like one of the, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7425.26s)]
*  it's not like a lazy Susan. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7427.0599999999995s)]
*  No, exactly, and the other thing it tells you is, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7429.0599999999995s)]
*  the best part of love is the falling in love part. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7432.62s)]
*  No it's not. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7436.34s)]
*  Infatuation, right? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7437.46s)]
*  Infatuation is to shake your world up enough, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7439.5s)]
*  so that you could cultivate that commitment, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7444.38s)]
*  so that it becomes, you're constantly tempted [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7448.219999999999s)]
*  to fall in love with the person again and again and again. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7450.74s)]
*  And that's what I thought was interesting [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7454.0199999999995s)]
*  that you said in the beginning was, [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7454.82s)]
*  when you were talking about your partner, about your wife, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7456.82s)]
*  that you said, if there's something new I see about her, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7460.419999999999s)]
*  or that she's a mystery. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7463.78s)]
*  Continuing to perceive that person as a mystery really, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7466.379999999999s)]
*  look at them as a mystery, it just makes it, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7470.62s)]
*  it's gonna make every day or every week, whatever, [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7473.5s)]
*  like a new episode, you're not gonna just be playing [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7476.66s)]
*  the same episode over and over again. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7479.82s)]
*  You're giving your framework, your framing as a perspective [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7481.42s)]
*  to, oh, let me see what else new I could learn [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7485.02s)]
*  or see about this person, or a new way [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7487.3s)]
*  that I can relate to them. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7489.54s)]
*  That's pretty fascinating. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7490.9s)]
*  So confronting a mystery rather than, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7492.34s)]
*  here, here, this is how you know your relationship is doomed [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7496.34s)]
*  if you turn your partner into a problem to be solved, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7502.3s)]
*  rather than a mystery to constantly face and be faithful to. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7506.3s)]
*  Wow, to be faithful to a mystery too, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7512.14s)]
*  that's a pretty brave thing, you know, it's exciting. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7513.66s)]
*  It's cool though, I think it's neat. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7515.66s)]
*  I think that's the, again, try to rehabilitate [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7517.58s)]
*  the notion of faith. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7520.54s)]
*  Instead of faith being asserting propositions, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7521.38s)]
*  pretending that you have certainty, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7524.3s)]
*  even though you don't have evidence, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7525.78s)]
*  what about we reconsider faith as faithfulness [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7527.74s)]
*  to the mystery of being so that we continually fall in love [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7530.7s)]
*  with reality in increasing depths within and without? [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7533.9400000000005s)]
*  Why don't we make faith faithfulness as opposed to, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7536.86s)]
*  I'm gonna say things that have no evidence [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7539.98s)]
*  and I'm gonna pretend that I'm certain about them. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7541.9s)]
*  I think that's a really modern, [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7543.78s)]
*  and it's not the ancient notion of faith, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7546.259999999999s)]
*  and that's one of the things, again, we lost. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7548.139999999999s)]
*  We've lost faith as a profound faithfulness. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7549.98s)]
*  Do you think, because you're a smart guy, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7553.82s)]
*  do you think it is, which is okay. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7555.7s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7557.58s)]
*  Some people are smart, and that's okay. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7558.419999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying you're good at volleyball, you know, [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7560.139999999999s)]
*  you might be bad at volleyball. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7561.74s)]
*  I don't know, but some things are, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7564.179999999999s)]
*  certain people are certain things. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7566.139999999999s)]
*  You appear smart, right? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7567.86s)]
*  To a pretty regular person like myself. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7569.740000000001s)]
*  Is it harder to be in love when you're smart? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7572.62s)]
*  Like, because smart makes it [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7575.780000000001s)]
*  so you kind of look at things a lot, you know? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7577.18s)]
*  So, intelligent people generally have a harder time, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7580.3s)]
*  and the problem, and this is the work of Stanovic and others, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7585.66s)]
*  the problem we've also gotten into [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7589.34s)]
*  is we've confused being intelligent with being rational, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7590.820000000001s)]
*  and we've confused being rational with being logical, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7593.780000000001s)]
*  and so we get all messed up about this. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7596.26s)]
*  Intelligence is your capacity to solve problems. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7598.66s)]
*  Rationality is ultimately, I would argue, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7601.3s)]
*  and this is the ancient notion, this is Plato's notion, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7603.86s)]
*  it's not about being logical. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7606.18s)]
*  Rationality is about using your intelligence [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7607.38s)]
*  to become aware of the self-deception and the bias [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7610.3s)]
*  so that you can overcome it. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7613.5s)]
*  That's what, so mindfulness is a way of being rational, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7614.74s)]
*  even though you're not running any arguments in your head. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7617.66s)]
*  Okay. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7619.9s)]
*  So, if you, and Plato, [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7620.74s)]
*  Plato was deep about reason in that sense. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7622.46s)]
*  Reason, we still carry it around [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7625.82s)]
*  when we talk about somebody being reasonable, right? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7627.26s)]
*  Reason in that sense and love, they're interwoven, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7629.9800000000005s)]
*  because reason in that sense is the profound love [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7632.38s)]
*  and faithfulness to what is true, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7636.54s)]
*  what is good and beautiful. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7638.74s)]
*  And I think if you're intelligent and you're not, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7640.780000000001s)]
*  and you haven't cultivated rationality [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7644.7s)]
*  and its accompanying virtues, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7647.22s)]
*  then you are more and more tempted [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7649.820000000001s)]
*  to problematize your relationship [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7654.14s)]
*  just because you have the intelligence machinery to use. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7656.9400000000005s)]
*  Ah. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7660.06s)]
*  But if you could, so, but if you could. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7661.18s)]
*  You start making hurdles because your brain, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7663.9400000000005s)]
*  that's what it's, it just, it likes to solve problems, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7665.5s)]
*  so it'll just make problems. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7667.54s)]
*  Right, and what your brain will also do, right, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7668.660000000001s)]
*  is your brain, so your brain is [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7671.02s)]
*  a powerful prediction machine, it's a relevance, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7673.5s)]
*  remember we talked about anticipating the future? [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7676.46s)]
*  So, your brain is constantly also trying to solve problems [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7678.780000000001s)]
*  you didn't solve in the past. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7683.62s)]
*  And so, in a bit of a slogan, [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7685.54s)]
*  your brain actually prefers familiar unhappiness [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7688.86s)]
*  to unexpected happiness. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7691.82s)]
*  Because it likes organization, right? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7694.099999999999s)]
*  It likes familiarity, because familiarity [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7695.42s)]
*  at least initially seems that you're predicting things. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7698.26s)]
*  Now the problem with familiarity is, and you know this, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7701.0599999999995s)]
*  you see this in your friends and they see it in you, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7703.42s)]
*  and the great gift is if you could come [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7706.26s)]
*  to see it in yourself. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7709.18s)]
*  You're doing that thing, Bill, you're doing that thing [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7710.34s)]
*  you're always doing your relationships, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7712.14s)]
*  you're doing it again, right? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7713.740000000001s)]
*  And you seem so wise from the outside, [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7715.38s)]
*  except two years later Bill comes to you and says, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7717.740000000001s)]
*  you know, you're doing that thing again. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7720.780000000001s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7723.3s)]
*  Now you're doing that thing. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7724.46s)]
*  Right, yeah, yeah. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7725.62s)]
*  I know, it's so interesting. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7726.58s)]
*  So, you have to, your intelligence not only [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7728.1s)]
*  is problematizing things by looking for problems, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7730.46s)]
*  it's also trying to solve previous relationships, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7732.9400000000005s)]
*  but in, often in a maladaptive way. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7736.02s)]
*  But if you can bring rationality in the platonic sense, [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7738.74s)]
*  rationality, love, virtue, into faithfulness, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7743.74s)]
*  and they're all interdependent, if you can bring that in, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7749.0599999999995s)]
*  then I think then it shifts and that actually makes, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7751.58s)]
*  gives you a greater capacity to enter deeply [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7755.46s)]
*  into a loving relationship. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7758.26s)]
*  I want everybody to understand, I'm like 61, almost 62, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7760.42s)]
*  and I've like screwed up. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7765.82s)]
*  You look young, man. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7767.18s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7768.06s)]
*  I've screwed up a lot, and I continue to make sense. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7768.900000000001s)]
*  So, I wanna give credit to a lot of the people [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7773.700000000001s)]
*  that helped me along the way, and I wanna give credit [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7779.66s)]
*  to my friends and also to my beloved partner. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7781.860000000001s)]
*  For like, for anything I'm saying here, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7786.1s)]
*  I owe it profoundly to them. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7787.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and we're just trying our best, you know? [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7791.14s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you know everything. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7792.9800000000005s)]
*  No, and I don't wanna come across that way, [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7795.1s)]
*  but I do want, but I, okay, good, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7796.54s)]
*  but I also feel your questions deserve, you know, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7798.7s)]
*  the best, most responsible answer I can give them. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7802.82s)]
*  No, and I appreciate that. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7805.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7806.66s)]
*  Yeah, because I think that's a challenging thing. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7809.38s)]
*  These days, I mean, especially, you know, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7811.22s)]
*  we've let so much, like, we've let so much, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7814.34s)]
*  and I don't know if it's capitalism or what we let win [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7819.7s)]
*  in our country, we let those things become more important. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7823.9s)]
*  Like, you know, we let, like, I mean, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7827.0599999999995s)]
*  I use pornography as an example, just how it killed, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7829.86s)]
*  it's killed a lot of the libido in the world, I feel like, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7832.259999999999s)]
*  and so there's no. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7836.0599999999995s)]
*  It makes salient as opposed to offering depth. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7837.54s)]
*  See, and Han talks about this in Saving Beauty. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7841.179999999999s)]
*  He talks about how pornography makes, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7845.219999999999s)]
*  he talks about how we've tried to make everything smooth. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7847.82s)]
*  We've, instead of, see, if you read The Ancients, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7850.62s)]
*  or even Rilka, beauty is almost terrifying, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7853.14s)]
*  because it shocks you, it wakes you up, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7855.5s)]
*  it makes you, oh, I didn't realize [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7857.3s)]
*  the world could be like this. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7859.18s)]
*  Oh, I remember, I saw a hot chick, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7860.1s)]
*  I couldn't even handle it, dude. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7861.46s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7862.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I tried to almost bury myself in the dirt one time, [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7863.58s)]
*  because I couldn't handle it the first time I saw a beautiful girl. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7866.54s)]
*  It's overwhelmingly powerful. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7868.58s)]
*  And you know, like, 11 inches of dirt out [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7870.54s)]
*  and fucking sat in there. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7872.1s)]
*  Isn't that crazy, though? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7874.18s)]
*  Well, it's something that we've done everything else to. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7875.62s)]
*  We've tried to, like, what did Rilka say? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7880.66s)]
*  Beauty is the angel that almost threatens [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7884.46s)]
*  to kill you, but doesn't. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7888.099999999999s)]
*  Mm. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7889.38s)]
*  Right? [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7890.22s)]
*  And then what pornography does, according to Han, [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7891.0599999999995s)]
*  is it just makes everything, there's no challenge. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7893.7s)]
*  And we think that's great, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7896.7s)]
*  because now it's easily accessible. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7898.34s)]
*  I can have it, but there's no confrontation with mystery. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7899.7s)]
*  There's no calling to go beyond oneself. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7903.3s)]
*  There's no calling to challenge one. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7905.82s)]
*  So, I think that's the thing. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7907.58s)]
*  There's no calling to challenge one. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7908.94s)]
*  So, everything is now smooth for us. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7910.54s)]
*  And we've adopted an aesthetic of the smooth [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7912.9s)]
*  and the easy and the comfortable. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7916.0199999999995s)]
*  I think you're right. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7917.339999999999s)]
*  Pornography is a clear symptom of just how... [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7918.339999999999s)]
*  And then we, and it's hyperbolic discounting. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7923.339999999999s)]
*  We get the momentary thing, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7926.179999999999s)]
*  and we lose the long-term project. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7928.78s)]
*  Yeah, the long-term project of relationship, [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7931.7s)]
*  of cultivating sexuality between yourself and a partner. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7934.139999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7937.62s)]
*  Do I wanna go out and meet someone [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7938.9s)]
*  and try to fall in love and try to covet them [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7941.18s)]
*  and respect them and create sensuality [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7944.74s)]
*  and make this long diatribe of a relationship [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7949.22s)]
*  that has value to both me and them? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7952.82s)]
*  Or do I just wanna go squeeze one out over here? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7955.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7958.5s)]
*  And a lot of times, you'll just choose that easier one. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7959.54s)]
*  You'll just buy a new vape or something [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7962.5s)]
*  and choose that easier one, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7964.22s)]
*  instead of go that longer road [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7965.66s)]
*  where there's gonna be more value. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7967.34s)]
*  And it's almost become so prevalent [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7969.860000000001s)]
*  that some people don't even know [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7971.74s)]
*  that there is the longer road in here. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7973.74s)]
*  The fact that... [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7975.860000000001s)]
*  That's the scary part to me. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7976.7s)]
*  We're growing up in a generation [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7978.34s)]
*  who has never been without screens [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7979.74s)]
*  and where pornography is available all the time everywhere. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7983.06s)]
*  And everything is if you want to laugh. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7986.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, this is kind of an interesting one, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7988.860000000001s)]
*  but if you wanna laugh, you can go find you a laugh. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7990.82s)]
*  You can find a laugh pretty quick. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7993.62s)]
*  But if you wanted to be out, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7995.42s)]
*  we had to make each other... [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7997.42s)]
*  Like you had to be the videos you're watching in a way. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=7999.18s)]
*  You had to use your imagination [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8003.3s)]
*  to iterate what had happened before. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8006.02s)]
*  You felt like a cog in the wheel of entertainment [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8009.46s)]
*  just by being a human being. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8016.46s)]
*  And some of that has disappeared. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8018.62s)]
*  I mean, conversation is... [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8022.3s)]
*  People are listening to people have conversations. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8023.9s)]
*  That's how archaic they're becoming. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8026.58s)]
*  That people are listening to podcasts [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8029.0199999999995s)]
*  to hear people talk freely. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8030.7s)]
*  So by the way, I loved seeing you that animated. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8034.179999999999s)]
*  That was really powerful. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8038.339999999999s)]
*  So thank you for sharing that with me. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8039.66s)]
*  That was really... [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8041.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, thanks, man. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8041.98s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know it was gonna be so powerful to me, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8042.82s)]
*  but I think it does. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8044.54s)]
*  I think I've felt fallen victim so much to pornography, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8045.58s)]
*  especially in my 20s that like, dude, [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8048.42s)]
*  it just makes me mad, you know? [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8050.74s)]
*  Time wasted. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8053.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, time wasted. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8053.86s)]
*  And the ability to love wasted [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8055.139999999999s)]
*  and the ability to learn about love. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8056.78s)]
*  I didn't have any other choice, [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8059.0599999999995s)]
*  but I mean, I maybe had a choice, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8060.74s)]
*  but I wasn't aware. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8062.74s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8063.7s)]
*  But anyway, go on. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8064.82s)]
*  I was just gonna say that one of the things [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8066.54s)]
*  that I'm trying to do with the podcasts and the videos, [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8070.259999999999s)]
*  but I'm also building in-person things [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8075.299999999999s)]
*  is build a bridge between those. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8077.379999999999s)]
*  So that when people see these, [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8078.94s)]
*  because I get comments all the time, [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8080.78s)]
*  I wish I could be part of those kind of conversation, [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8082.0199999999995s)]
*  that kind of dia logo, so I use the Greek word. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8084.78s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8086.74s)]
*  And then when you say, well, you can, [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8087.82s)]
*  and here's a place you can come [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8089.339999999999s)]
*  where you can start to practice it. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8090.94s)]
*  And either you can do it through a Zoom room, [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8094.299999999999s)]
*  and that still works, by the way, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8096.58s)]
*  which is really fascinating, [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8097.74s)]
*  because as a scientist, I wonder would it work, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8099.0599999999995s)]
*  but it still does. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8100.9s)]
*  But we can also do it in-person [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8102.0599999999995s)]
*  and trying to build that bridge so people can, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8103.42s)]
*  once they see, I wanna be part of that, [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8105.66s)]
*  I wanna participate in that, [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8107.66s)]
*  like you were just talking about with so much life. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8108.94s)]
*  There's a place they can go where they can. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8112.54s)]
*  There's a bridge between witnessing [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8114.74s)]
*  and wanting to be in such a conversation [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8117.339999999999s)]
*  and actually practicing and participating in it. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8119.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8121.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's also, [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8123.259999999999s)]
*  there's 12-step programs for everything, which is great. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8124.74s)]
*  And I go to some of the meetings for, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8127.299999999999s)]
*  they have like intimacy and love addiction, [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8129.339999999999s)]
*  and some of the names of the groups [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8131.66s)]
*  are a little bit off sometimes, [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8133.66s)]
*  but you can go in there and listen to people talk about [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8135.339999999999s)]
*  their struggles with relationships [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8139.5s)]
*  and sometimes pornography, all different types of stuff. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8142.34s)]
*  I met a buddy that was a flasher in there, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8146.94s)]
*  so you get all type, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8148.9s)]
*  I mean, some of it's kind of cool, kind of. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8149.74s)]
*  I mean, not cool, but it is kind of neat. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8152.18s)]
*  You know, you know a flasher, [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8154.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, you know one, you know him. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8155.139999999999s)]
*  That's great. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8158.62s)]
*  So yeah, I think some of that's just, [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8160.82s)]
*  the rooms that are out there that people are sharing [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8162.5s)]
*  what their life is like and getting better [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8165.18s)]
*  and recovering from those things are pretty fascinating. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8167.54s)]
*  It's also at a time where it's like, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8171.42s)]
*  yeah, if you're willing to share what's going on with you, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8172.94s)]
*  there's a ton of value to that. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8174.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as long as it doesn't turn into that thing [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8177.0199999999995s)]
*  we were talking about earlier, like the reality shows, [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8180.0199999999995s)]
*  where it just becomes something that we can modify [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8181.9s)]
*  in order to put another trophy of narcissism on our wall, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8184.1s)]
*  right, and see how special I am? [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8188.5s)]
*  I can disclose more than you can. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8190.46s)]
*  And that's why I think, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8192.5s)]
*  that's why I really strongly challenge, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8194.86s)]
*  don't think that there's one thing you can do [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8198.02s)]
*  that will be a panacea. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8201.300000000001s)]
*  You need a whole bunch of practices, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8202.5s)]
*  all doing this checks and balance. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8204.62s)]
*  You need to do it with a bunch of different people [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8206.300000000001s)]
*  coming from different perspectives, right? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8208.18s)]
*  And only then do you have the chance [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8210.460000000001s)]
*  that it might not degenerate in that fashion. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8212.26s)]
*  Yeah, because I do worry that we're getting [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8215.7s)]
*  kind of like therapy porn starting to emerge in our culture [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8218.18s)]
*  where what, you know what I'm gonna do [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8221.74s)]
*  is I'm gonna just open up and share my feelings. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8223.94s)]
*  And it's like, toward what end? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8226.900000000001s)]
*  Are you cultivating virtue? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8228.220000000001s)]
*  Are you overcoming self-deception? [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8229.5s)]
*  Are you helping the other person to grow? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8231.220000000001s)]
*  No, it's just, I'm gonna expose myself. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8233.62s)]
*  So that's, you know, right? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8236.54s)]
*  And it's like the flasher, right? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8238.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8239.58s)]
*  And it's like, I'm gonna expose myself. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8240.5s)]
*  And then what we'll do is, [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8242.380000000001s)]
*  I got to see deeply into somebody and it, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8244.62s)]
*  oh, it was so smooth, it was so easy. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8246.34s)]
*  It's pornography. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8248.140000000001s)]
*  It doesn't take any commitment or challenge. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8249.18s)]
*  I don't have to make myself responsible to that person. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8251.460000000001s)]
*  They'll just gush and I'll just drink it in. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8253.98s)]
*  And I'm worried that that's growing right now. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8257.3s)]
*  Wow, that's fascinating, man. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8259.58s)]
*  Yeah, because I worry about that sometimes. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8261.86s)]
*  Like not only in my own life, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8263.74s)]
*  but yeah, you see stuff like that. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8265.22s)]
*  I have some friends that are vloggers [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8267.58s)]
*  and they vlog every minute of their lives very much. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8269.82s)]
*  And you can see they start to get, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8273.1s)]
*  like they don't even remember what they're doing anymore. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8276.14s)]
*  They're performing constantly for an audience [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8279.02s)]
*  and they start doing strange things [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8282.9s)]
*  and almost become trapped in this manic episode. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8285.94s)]
*  It's that reciprocal narrowing. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8290.18s)]
*  And they're trying to have something [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8291.5s)]
*  instead of become someone. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8294.18s)]
*  The fact that, I mean, that's another symptom [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8297.42s)]
*  of the meaning crisis. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8299.34s)]
*  The fact that you noted, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8300.18s)]
*  this kind of stuff is spreading like a disease. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8301.74s)]
*  Yeah, right, yeah. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8304.300000000001s)]
*  But there's always been diseases, right? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8306.78s)]
*  There's always been things that have come along. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8308.26s)]
*  We've always gotten through them. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8310.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, sometimes we got through [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8312.98s)]
*  and like the Bronze Age collapse, you know, 1177 BCE. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8316.300000000001s)]
*  We had Bronze Age civilizations, ancient Egypt, [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8322.74s)]
*  Assyria, Babylon, the Hittite Empire, [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8326.14s)]
*  the Mycenaean civilization. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8327.82s)]
*  They all collapsed. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8329.06s)]
*  All collapsed, except for Egypt. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8329.9s)]
*  Assyria almost collapses, it shrinks. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8331.5s)]
*  Egypt survives because one of my favorite people of history, [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8334.9s)]
*  I just got a book on him, Ramesses III. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8337.62s)]
*  He's a military genius and he defeats the invading people [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8339.7s)]
*  to see peoples in two great battles. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8344.7s)]
*  And he's like, he's trying to hold up [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8346.74s)]
*  the whole Bronze Age world on his shoulders. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8349.42s)]
*  But even Egypt, once he gets assassinated [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8353.1s)]
*  and once he's gone, even Egypt goes into decline. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8356.86s)]
*  So most of the civil, more cities went out of existence. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8359.539999999999s)]
*  More trade is lost, more literacy is lost [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8364.46s)]
*  than any other time in the Western world. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8366.86s)]
*  Even the fall of the Western Roman Empire [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8368.42s)]
*  was not as great as the Bronze Age collapse. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8371.02s)]
*  So things can really collapse now. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8373.060000000001s)]
*  And then there's like, there's several centuries [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8374.900000000001s)]
*  and you don't wanna be alive in the centuries [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8376.900000000001s)]
*  after the Bronze Age collapse. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8378.54s)]
*  They're really, really bad time to be alive. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8379.7s)]
*  Oh, it gets pretty sketchy. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8381.78s)]
*  It gets really bad. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8382.94s)]
*  But it opens up possibilities and people start to experiment. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8383.980000000001s)]
*  They create new psychotechnologies, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8388.1s)]
*  alphabetic literacy, numeracy. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8390.140000000001s)]
*  And that gives birth to the actual age [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8392.02s)]
*  to people like Socrates and Buddha and Lao Tse. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8393.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like you just needed it over time. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8399.34s)]
*  It's like, that's the cycle. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8401.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's some people who think [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8403.34s)]
*  that complex organizations go through [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8404.779999999999s)]
*  what's called self-organizing criticality. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8409.58s)]
*  They organize and they build and they get very complex [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8411.699999999999s)]
*  and then they get too top heavy, like a pile of sand. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8413.859999999999s)]
*  And then it avalanches and it all collapses. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8418.02s)]
*  But that provides a broader base [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8420.46s)]
*  and then it can build again even higher [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8422.1s)]
*  than before and it oscillates in that way. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8423.66s)]
*  Some people have argued that. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8426.14s)]
*  Human cognition seems to work in that way too. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8427.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8430.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8431.42s)]
*  You know what? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8434.26s)]
*  You can't solve this problem. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8435.1s)]
*  And you gotta sense, but you're just framing it [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8437.02s)]
*  the wrong way, but you can't break out of the wrong frame. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8439.78s)]
*  And what often has to happen is you have to break [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8443.14s)]
*  that frame and sometimes breaking is really, really hard. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8446.02s)]
*  Sometimes it's easy. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8449.66s)]
*  You'll do things like you'll say to people, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8451.06s)]
*  what's the gray stuff that comes from fire? [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8454.06s)]
*  And they say smoke. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8456.06s)]
*  And what am I doing with my hand right now, my arm? [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8457.22s)]
*  Oh, that's a stroke. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8459.22s)]
*  And what am I doing right now? [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8460.619999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's a choke. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8462.22s)]
*  And what kind of tree grows from an acorn that's an oak? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8463.46s)]
*  And what do you call the white of an egg? [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8466.74s)]
*  And they'll say, oh, yolk. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8468.1s)]
*  Of course it's not, it's the white of the egg. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8469.34s)]
*  You fall into a frame and you get locked. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8471.58s)]
*  And sometimes the frames are fairly easy. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8473.74s)]
*  Sometimes the frames are really, really hard. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8475.26s)]
*  Like you're deep in modal confusion. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8477.66s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8480.14s)]
*  And so breaking that frame is like that avalanche. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8481.26s)]
*  You have to break that frame. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8484.38s)]
*  But if you don't break it to the point of trauma, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8486.66s)]
*  if you break it in the right way, [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8489.06s)]
*  what it does is it allows the brain's capacity [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8490.82s)]
*  to self-organize, to reorganize from like a broader [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8494.38s)]
*  or different base. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8497.06s)]
*  And then you get a new frame [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8498.179999999998s)]
*  and then you get that aha moment. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8499.3s)]
*  And typically what happens, at least that's [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8501.179999999998s)]
*  a significant theory is the activity is predominantly [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8504.019999999999s)]
*  in the left hemisphere, which is your logical sort [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8507.9s)]
*  of step-by-step fine grain, well-defined problem side. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8510.140000000001s)]
*  And you realize, oh, I can't solve this problem. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8513.380000000001s)]
*  And it goes into the right hemisphere, [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8514.94s)]
*  which was for like predation. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8516.78s)]
*  The party's at. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8518.460000000001s)]
*  Well, it's predation. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8519.300000000001s)]
*  It's wide open attention. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8520.140000000001s)]
*  You're trying to get a wide picture, the big perspective. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8521.380000000001s)]
*  And what you do is you go over there, [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8525.300000000001s)]
*  get a new bigger perspective and then bring it back in. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8527.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8529.98s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8531.06s)]
*  Do you think sometimes like, you know, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8535.02s)]
*  say if you put like, you took a bunch of sand, right? [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8539.060000000001s)]
*  And you just poured it into this glass right here. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8544.060000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8547.74s)]
*  This, it would fill it up, right? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8548.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8550.58s)]
*  Do you ever think that there's a lot more going on [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8551.42s)]
*  in the world, but that us as a vet, like a vessel [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8553.060000000001s)]
*  only can understand so much. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8557.140000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8560.5s)]
*  So that there could be so much more happening out here, [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8561.34s)]
*  but our ability to understand is only, it's this glass. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8563.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8568.3s)]
*  So I would say I know that's the case [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8569.14s)]
*  because of what we rely on. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8572.259999999998s)]
*  So most of our problem solving is not done as individuals. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8575.34s)]
*  You didn't invent English, I didn't invent English. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8578.859999999999s)]
*  You're not managing the electric grid. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8580.859999999999s)]
*  I'm not a manager, you didn't invent these microphones. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8582.619999999999s)]
*  I didn't invent them, right? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8585.58s)]
*  You didn't make these chairs. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8587.06s)]
*  You didn't build this building, blah, blah, blah, blah, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8588.099999999999s)]
*  like we forget that most of our problems, [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8590.42s)]
*  no one person can run an airline or a railroad, right? [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8593.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8597.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8598.82s)]
*  And so what you can show, actually what we seem to do, [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8599.66s)]
*  I've done work on this with Dan Schiappi. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8603.74s)]
*  We've investigated the scientists moving the rovers [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8605.3s)]
*  around on Mars, but our primary adaptivity is [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8608.1s)]
*  we plug into that collective intelligence, [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8614.019999999999s)]
*  and that collective intelligence can often grasp objects [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8616.539999999999s)]
*  that we can't individually grasp. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8621.34s)]
*  So it could be bigger than this. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8622.619999999999s)]
*  Right, so to give you a clear example, no one, [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8623.859999999999s)]
*  and I'm not trying to get into political controversies [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8626.94s)]
*  right now, but no one person can perceive [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8628.98s)]
*  or even measure or track global warming. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8632.74s)]
*  It takes a whole bunch of scientists, [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8634.74s)]
*  it's a whole bunch of equipment all around the world. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8636.06s)]
*  Yeah, totally, you can't just be some dude guessing. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8637.859999999999s)]
*  Right, and no one person, this is at Hutchins, [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8639.859999999999s)]
*  no one person navigates a ship. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8643.5s)]
*  It's a bunch of people and a bunch of equipment, [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8645.5s)]
*  and they navigate the ship, right? [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8647.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8649.38s)]
*  And so we plug into the intelligence of civilization, [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8650.22s)]
*  basically, but the problem is there are things [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8655.98s)]
*  that can even exceed that, because civilizations [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8658.9s)]
*  probably face what's called general systems collapse. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8662.859999999999s)]
*  What that means is, so here's a civilization, [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8667.22s)]
*  and it's growing, and what it's doing is [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8670.5s)]
*  it's solving problems, and every time a new problem [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8673.42s)]
*  emerges, it adds a new piece on itself, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8677.22s)]
*  and it grows, and it grows, and it grows, [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8680.34s)]
*  and initially, it's good at growing, [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8683.18s)]
*  and it's solving more and more problems. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8685.3s)]
*  The problem is, as it grows more and more and more, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8686.779999999999s)]
*  think about a bureaucracy, or a government bureaucracy, [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8688.66s)]
*  as it grows more and more and more, [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8691.9s)]
*  it starts to become as complicated as anything [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8693.66s)]
*  it's trying to solve in the world. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8696.46s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8698.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8699.42s)]
*  And eventually, it gets so big that it can't manage itself [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8700.26s)]
*  well enough to solve any unexpected new problems, [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8704.5s)]
*  and then you get general systems collapse. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8707.099999999999s)]
*  And it's making its own problems, then, too. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8708.9s)]
*  And it's making its own problems, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8710.34s)]
*  and it starts to be, and you can tell when an institution [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8711.980000000001s)]
*  is cusping on that, and I think the universities [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8715.34s)]
*  are suffering this problem, is when the bureaucracy [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8719.140000000001s)]
*  starts to become for its own sake, [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8723.460000000001s)]
*  rather than for solving problems, because it's much more [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8725.42s)]
*  about managing and maintaining its own existence, right? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8728.26s)]
*  And the civil services of some countries [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8731.42s)]
*  go down that route, too. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8734.140000000001s)]
*  So I think we have an individual limit, [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8735.66s)]
*  and then we deal with that by plugging into [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8737.7s)]
*  the civilization, but the civilizations also [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8739.9s)]
*  have a threshold. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8742.3s)]
*  Man, fricking existing, bro, it's complicated. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8744.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, and the thing is, it's complicated, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8748.42s)]
*  but reality is actually complex. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8751.02s)]
*  Complicated is we can manage all the variables, [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8753.779999999999s)]
*  but there's just a lot of them. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8759.14s)]
*  Complex is we have real uncertainty, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8760.619999999999s)]
*  and there are new emergent variables, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8763.1s)]
*  and they're dynamically shifting their relationship [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8765.3s)]
*  to each other. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8767.18s)]
*  Reality is actually complex. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8768.02s)]
*  And we create complicated systems within and without [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8770.18s)]
*  and between us to drill with that complexity, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8772.02s)]
*  but at some point, we get challenged. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8774.380000000001s)]
*  And part of what I think we need to face, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8776.980000000001s)]
*  that was a distinction from Snowden, [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8779.7s)]
*  part of what we need to face, and this comes out [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8782.300000000001s)]
*  in my conversations with Jordan Hall and others, [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8786.94s)]
*  and this is something we're now discovering in biology. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8789.94s)]
*  So you can evolve a trait, like this creature's [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8791.980000000001s)]
*  gonna be faster, right, or taller, or something like that. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8796.1s)]
*  But what we're now realizing, and this is, [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8799.939999999999s)]
*  is it Owen Gilbert? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8801.74s)]
*  Yeah, I always get the names the wrong way around, right? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8802.58s)]
*  You can also evolve your evolvability, [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8805.859999999999s)]
*  which is you can evolve so you can evolve faster [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8808.82s)]
*  or better than other species. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8812.38s)]
*  Really, so you can mate with someone who evolves well [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8814.099999999999s)]
*  and make a hyper- [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8816.539999999999s)]
*  Well, no, no, no, no, no, let's just, [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8817.66s)]
*  you just brought something up there. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8819.06s)]
*  Okay, for millions of years, organisms are single-celled [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8821.06s)]
*  and they reproduce asexually, they just divide, right? [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8825.699999999999s)]
*  Human beings reproduce sexually. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8829.98s)]
*  Sexuality reshuffles the genetic deck [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8832.699999999999s)]
*  so we get more variation, and with more variation, [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8835.5s)]
*  evolution speeds up. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8838.939999999999s)]
*  So one of the reasons sex becomes pervasive [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8840.939999999999s)]
*  is because it makes you more evolvable as a species. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8845.38s)]
*  And now, using that analogy, we have to learn to become, [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8848.9s)]
*  we have to stop just, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8852.939999999999s)]
*  no, sorry, we don't have, we shouldn't stop, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8855.22s)]
*  I'm gonna become stronger or braver. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8856.82s)]
*  We have to keep doing that, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8859.060000000001s)]
*  but we have to do this higher order thing. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8859.900000000001s)]
*  We have to evolve our evolvability right now [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8862.900000000001s)]
*  because the way things are complexifying [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8865.86s)]
*  is accelerating dramatically. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8870.1s)]
*  Well, especially in the US, I mean, it's like we've become, [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8872.02s)]
*  you know, it's a very, I mean, [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8874.820000000002s)]
*  America's always been kind of a, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8875.900000000001s)]
*  it's always been like a diversifying landscape, you know? [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8879.34s)]
*  I think a lot of people, I know it's been tough [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8882.740000000002s)]
*  for my mother and for people of her generation [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8885.26s)]
*  because they had like this idea of America, right? [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8888.66s)]
*  And like of what it stood for and the things we fought for [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8892.179999999998s)]
*  and the things that our brothers and sisters died for, [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8895.34s)]
*  you know, those, all of that. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8898.019999999999s)]
*  And those things, a lot of those things now, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8899.82s)]
*  people look at them and the news will scoff at those things. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8901.539999999999s)]
*  Or sneer, yes. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8904.34s)]
*  Yes, even sneer, not even take into account [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8905.179999999998s)]
*  that some of these people died [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8907.619999999999s)]
*  or that their loved ones had to witness them die. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8910.179999999998s)]
*  Like, you know, and a lot of those people [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8913.06s)]
*  start to lose their hope, you know? [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8916.66s)]
*  Yeah, they lose orientation, right? [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8920.58s)]
*  I mean, completely lose orientation, which is crazy. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8923.619999999999s)]
*  Like, that's how much a comfortable landscape [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8926.38s)]
*  or commonalities mean to people. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8930.42s)]
*  See, the landscape doesn't have to be comfortable. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8934.26s)]
*  They were willing to go to war. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8935.82s)]
*  They were, the landscape has to be navigatable. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8937.1s)]
*  And navigation is not something you can do [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8941.7s)]
*  primarily on your own, right? [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8944.02s)]
*  You have to do, you have to obviously move yourself around. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8945.460000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8948.18s)]
*  But you have to be oriented and other people [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8949.02s)]
*  have to cooperate in the orientation with you [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8950.18s)]
*  and you help each other. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8952.58s)]
*  And that's how you navigate a landscape. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8954.34s)]
*  And because of what you just said, we're losing, [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8956.34s)]
*  another way of talking about the meeting crisis, [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8959.380000000001s)]
*  not being at home, domicide, [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8961.42s)]
*  is people are feeling increasingly disoriented. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8963.140000000001s)]
*  They don't know which way to go. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8965.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8967.18s)]
*  They don't know what they should be doing. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8968.02s)]
*  And so what they do is they fall into things [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8969.34s)]
*  by default and I'm not criticizing anybody. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8971.98s)]
*  No, no, this is normal. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8973.54s)]
*  They fall into, I just keep on keeping on [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8975.14s)]
*  and I just do what I've been doing. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8978.14s)]
*  That's where I think a lot of people are right now. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8980.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8981.9s)]
*  You know, not only older folks, but younger folks as well. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8982.74s)]
*  They're just wondering what, [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8987.02s)]
*  I used to think I was part of something. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8989.5s)]
*  Now I don't feel like that anymore. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8992.06s)]
*  Looking out for just myself feels, doesn't feel good. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8994.34s)]
*  Well, it's very small. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=8999.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9000.3s)]
*  It feels really small. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9001.939999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think there's moments of it where it's nice [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9003.019999999999s)]
*  in a way where you're like, [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9007.3s)]
*  oh, I'm gonna have some self-confidence. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9008.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, of course. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9010.06s)]
*  I'm gonna achieve. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9010.9s)]
*  You have to have self-care. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9011.74s)]
*  Man, it feels very lonely, you know? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9012.98s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are kind of wondering that. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9015.539999999999s)]
*  So I wonder if that will lead people back to religion, [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9018.779999999999s)]
*  looking for purpose. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9022.9s)]
*  And I wonder why in America we've gone to Canadians. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9024.06s)]
*  I mean, you're Canadian. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9027.9s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9029.3s)]
*  Oh, and thank you for being Canadian. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9030.14s)]
*  I like them. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9031.66s)]
*  Well, John Oliver is right about Canada, right? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9032.539999999999s)]
*  I don't like John Oliver like a lot, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9035.019999999999s)]
*  but when he said that, you know, [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9037.539999999999s)]
*  it's as if the United States and Great Britain [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9039.699999999999s)]
*  had a child that they abandoned in the snow. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9041.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9043.859999999999s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9044.699999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, we lived under a superpower, [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9045.539999999999s)]
*  Great Britain, and we slowly negotiated a way out. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9050.699999999999s)]
*  We didn't have a revolution. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9053.82s)]
*  We slowly negotiated. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9054.859999999999s)]
*  We don't have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9056.019999999999s)]
*  We have peace, order, and good government. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9058.3s)]
*  That's our constitution. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9060.66s)]
*  We slowly negotiated our way out, right? [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9061.5s)]
*  And you can't point to a point in history [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9064.66s)]
*  and you say, that's when Canada [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9067.46s)]
*  was completely not a colony anymore. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9069.42s)]
*  It's there, maybe the Statute of Westminster in 1931, [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9071.699999999999s)]
*  but it's a gradual thing, right? [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9074.699999999999s)]
*  And as we slowly did that, [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9077.34s)]
*  this superpower emerged to the south of us [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9080.1s)]
*  that went on to conquer the world. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9083.02s)]
*  I mean, America is a titanic entity. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9085.58s)]
*  I mean, like, Second World War, [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9088.820000000002s)]
*  they take on the Japanese Empire almost single-handedly [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9091.62s)]
*  while manning most of the Western Front, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9094.74s)]
*  and it's titanic, it's huge, [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9098.54s)]
*  and they're just overwhelming, and they continue to be so. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9101.140000000001s)]
*  Like, even militarily, you take all of the other NATO countries [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9105.02s)]
*  and pit them against the American military. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9108.66s)]
*  The American military will destroy them in three days. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9110.1s)]
*  Like, America is like, and Canada is like, [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9113.1s)]
*  imagine this, there was a superpower, [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9117.3s)]
*  and we slowly managed to get out of its shadow, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9119.34s)]
*  very carefully negotiated, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9123.34s)]
*  only to have this other one emerge, right, [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9125.22s)]
*  that overshadows us powerfully and completely. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9127.859999999999s)]
*  So we're always in between. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9131.42s)]
*  We've always been in between, [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9134.42s)]
*  and we're always much more about, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9135.66s)]
*  because we can't enforce our way on the world, [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9137.9s)]
*  we're much more about perspective and negotiating. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9140.619999999999s)]
*  We negotiated with Great Britain, [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9143.82s)]
*  and we negotiate with the United States, [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9146.14s)]
*  and thankfully, both Great Britain and the United States [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9147.82s)]
*  are willing and have been willing to negotiate with us [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9151.779999999999s)]
*  and to ally with us. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9157.46s)]
*  Yeah, and you get to be right there, [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9158.779999999999s)]
*  you kind of have to have a, [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9161.3s)]
*  Canada's always been a very peaceful place, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9163.18s)]
*  I feel like, a lot of my friends there are good listeners. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9164.859999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9167.26s)]
*  You know, I think people are like, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9169.099999999999s)]
*  like, I'm surprised there's not a mass exodus to Canada, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9171.62s)]
*  but great posture, too. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9177.54s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever seen the posture in Toronto. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9179.5s)]
*  You seen it? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9181.86s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, part of it is because you can slouch [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9182.7s)]
*  in winter when you're wearing 10,000 layers of clothing. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9185.66s)]
*  That's a good point, huh? [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9188.1s)]
*  Right, you gotta bury yourself well. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9188.94s)]
*  Yeah, oh, and they do it. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9190.58s)]
*  You can barely, people just, you can barely see them, [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9191.980000000001s)]
*  they're so straight sometimes. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9194.66s)]
*  Just like watching something go by. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9196.58s)]
*  But yeah, I find that it's interesting [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9199.02s)]
*  that we're finding guys like you, Jordan Peterson, [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9202.86s)]
*  and you guys work together? [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9207.22s)]
*  We were colleagues. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9208.98s)]
*  Jordan was just down the hallway from me. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9209.82s)]
*  We continue to keep in communication. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9212.14s)]
*  Because he doesn't teach anymore now, does he? [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9215.58s)]
*  No, I mean, he had a very fraught relationship [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9217.1s)]
*  with the university. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9220.62s)]
*  Oh, he did? [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9221.54s)]
*  Yeah, and yeah. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9222.380000000001s)]
*  And I think there was fault on both sides in that issue. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9225.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, but I wanna be very clear. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9228.98s)]
*  I have a really good relationship [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9231.02s)]
*  with the University of Toronto. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9233.1s)]
*  They've treated me, well, the psychology department, [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9234.26s)]
*  at least, has treated me extremely, extremely well. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9238.1s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9240.7s)]
*  But Jordan and I were colleagues. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9241.82s)]
*  We were very friendly colleagues. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9244.78s)]
*  We shared students. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9246.86s)]
*  We would frequently find ourselves at the same conference [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9249.7s)]
*  talking about stuff. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9253.14s)]
*  That's fun. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9254.34s)]
*  Was it fun to discuss things with him [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9255.18s)]
*  and be able to communicate? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9256.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9257.7s)]
*  And I wanna say this very carefully, [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9259.86s)]
*  because whatever you say about Jordan Peterson, [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9265.7s)]
*  it'll bite you in the ass no matter what you say. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9267.5s)]
*  Because Jordan, Jordan's a very divisive person. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9270.380000000001s)]
*  But Jordan, and it's reciprocated, Jordan respects me. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9272.900000000001s)]
*  And when Jordan respects you, [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9280.42s)]
*  he interacts with you differently [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9282.58s)]
*  that if he doesn't respect you [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9285.1s)]
*  or he doesn't know if he should respect you. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9286.86s)]
*  Then he interacts. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9289.5s)]
*  This is at least to my mind. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9290.82s)]
*  It could be the safety mechanism too. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9293.1s)]
*  It could be a safety mechanism. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9294.54s)]
*  It could also be that that's the kind of teacher he was. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9296.060000000001s)]
*  Very careful. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9299.62s)]
*  There were three life-changing professors [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9300.460000000001s)]
*  at the University of Toronto. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9302.18s)]
*  One, I won't mention his name, [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9304.380000000001s)]
*  and the other two were myself and Jordan Peterson. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9306.62s)]
*  So we often shared students. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9311.1s)]
*  Like I said, I've always had, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9315.42s)]
*  and I've appreciated very good relationships with Jordan. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9317.7s)]
*  I don't agree with Jordan on certain things, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9321.5s)]
*  especially political things. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9323.66s)]
*  But you see, like when some of the stuff dropped initially, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9326.74s)]
*  I would send him an email and I'd say, [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9331.54s)]
*  here's my arguments against your position. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9333.66s)]
*  But I think they should treat you with respect. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9336.82s)]
*  You're making a point, you should be treated with, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9338.74s)]
*  like the way, he shouldn't have just been sneered at [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9341.14s)]
*  or yelled at. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9343.22s)]
*  They should have, they should have, they should, [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9344.58s)]
*  he deserved to be given a good hearing, [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9345.779999999999s)]
*  a good counter argument. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9349.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think once you get to a certain level [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9350.14s)]
*  kind of of popularity, [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9353.26s)]
*  and once you're in the social media sphere in some sense, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9354.1s)]
*  you don't, it becomes more of like a Mad Max [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9358.34s)]
*  beyond Thunderdome out there, [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9362.42s)]
*  and not as much of probably the grounds you guys are used to [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9363.619999999999s)]
*  where people communicate regularly. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9366.5s)]
*  Yeah, and so the thing is, [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9367.34s)]
*  like when I would write him that email, [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9369.3s)]
*  he would say thank you. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9372.1s)]
*  Like he was appreciative, [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9373.34s)]
*  or like I'll be on his channel with him, [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9374.26s)]
*  and he'll criticize postmodernism, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9378.86s)]
*  and I'll say, well, I think there's value to postmodernism, [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9381.74s)]
*  and here's the value, and here's, [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9384.06s)]
*  like Foucault was saying this, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9385.380000000001s)]
*  and Derrida was saying, [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9386.94s)]
*  and he'll be responsive and respectful. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9389.34s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9392.58s)]
*  And so, but the thing about that is, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9393.66s)]
*  is like it's, [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9398.18s)]
*  I want to maintain a good relationship with, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9402.539999999999s)]
*  like when he, somehow he found out I had diabetes, [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9405.02s)]
*  and he sent me like a supportive email, [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9407.38s)]
*  and I appreciate that. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9409.38s)]
*  Like I believe, [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9410.58s)]
*  and this will get me in hot water with some people, [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9413.14s)]
*  but I believe that Jordan is fundamentally a good person, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9414.9s)]
*  and I think he has very good intent, [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9417.34s)]
*  and I think he's terrifically talented. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9419.1s)]
*  But, well, the things that make you adaptive [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9423.34s)]
*  make you prone to self-deception, [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9426.18s)]
*  and there's things that he also, [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9428.74s)]
*  we fundamentally don't agree on. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9431.34s)]
*  But, right? [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9433.66s)]
*  I think if people, if we could get out of [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9436.98s)]
*  the polarization around him, [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9440.78s)]
*  and to be fair, I think he contributes to it. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9442.02s)]
*  I think by his own admission, [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9443.74s)]
*  he's not very good on Twitter. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9446.14s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9447.300000000001s)]
*  No, I think he would admit that. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9448.14s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what we talked about [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9450.42s)]
*  when I was with him, when I chatted with him. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9451.98s)]
*  If we could get out of polarizing, [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9453.7s)]
*  and if he could get out of being caught up in that, [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9456.380000000001s)]
*  like what's really impressive is like [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9459.7s)]
*  when I've talked to him, or Jonathan, [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9461.78s)]
*  Jonathan Impagio and I talked to him, [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9463.54s)]
*  he'll get a lot of comments like, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9465.26s)]
*  do more of those, Jordan, do more of those. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9466.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9468.58s)]
*  Right, because for me, I feel like that's the Jordan [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9469.42s)]
*  that I really respect, [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9472.62s)]
*  and I have affection for coming to the fore. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9474.1s)]
*  And then there's this other aspect of him [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9476.26s)]
*  that I can't connect to him. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9478.74s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he likes to get into the frockus of it, [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9482.5s)]
*  you know? [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9484.78s)]
*  That's a philosophical difference between us. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9486.34s)]
*  I think trying to solve the meaning crisis [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9488.140000000001s)]
*  at the adversarial level of propositional [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9492.300000000001s)]
*  just ideas and ideologies and that kind, [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9495.86s)]
*  I don't think it can be solved there. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9498.34s)]
*  We've been talking about a much different level, [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9499.5s)]
*  a much different ways in which the meaning crisis [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9501.980000000001s)]
*  has to be solved. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9503.980000000001s)]
*  I think, and I don't, this isn't a scapegoat. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9504.820000000002s)]
*  This costs me, so this doesn't come for free. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9509.660000000002s)]
*  This isn't a cop out. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9512.02s)]
*  I'm meta-political. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9513.02s)]
*  I think that trying to get engaged with this problem [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9514.380000000001s)]
*  in a political framing is fundamentally a modal confusion. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9517.78s)]
*  It is to make that kind of profound mistake. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9522.74s)]
*  I think the left at its best reminds us [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9524.7s)]
*  that we're finite animals subject to fate, [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9526.98s)]
*  and we have to show compassion to each other. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9529.22s)]
*  And the right at its best reminds us [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9531.26s)]
*  that we're also called to transcendence [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9533.7s)]
*  and the cultivation of virtue. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9536.54s)]
*  And when they worked where they were correcting each other [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9538.1s)]
*  and helping each other emerge, [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9541.3s)]
*  and were committed to democracy, [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9543.86s)]
*  then we have something wonderful. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9545.740000000002s)]
*  When they break that up into winner take all, [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9547.220000000001s)]
*  the other side is evil and I have to destroy them, [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9549.5s)]
*  then that society, that democracy is doomed and over. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9552.94s)]
*  And I think that's where our political situation is. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9556.94s)]
*  So I refuse, like Socrates, I refuse, and Plato, [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9559.140000000001s)]
*  I refuse to participate in the political domain [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9563.060000000001s)]
*  because for me, I do not, and see, [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9566.1s)]
*  Jordan wants to go in there guns blazing, [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9568.54s)]
*  and that's a fundamental difference between us. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9572.26s)]
*  And so we've come to understand [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9574.66s)]
*  that we won't talk about those things. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9576.699999999999s)]
*  Right, those are just ways you guys are. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9578.82s)]
*  And I'm glad we probably need people to be both ways. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9580.859999999999s)]
*  I think some of the online stuff gets like, [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9583.58s)]
*  it gets addictive probably, you know? [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9587.98s)]
*  It is. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9591.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think once you get into that world, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9592.58s)]
*  there's people that their whole lives are that world, [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9594.46s)]
*  and he loves to argue points. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9596.9s)]
*  So I think if you wanna argue stuff, [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9598.46s)]
*  you can do it all day there. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9601.18s)]
*  But it's argument, it's argument for, [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9603.380000000001s)]
*  Plato made a distinction between Philo Sophia, [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9606.54s)]
*  the love of wisdom, and Philo Nikea, the love of victory. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9608.74s)]
*  And when it's the love of victory, [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9611.7s)]
*  then you've lost the Socratic spirit, right? [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9613.300000000001s)]
*  I will disagree with people. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9616.78s)]
*  Bishop Maxapas and I, we disagree. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9618.300000000001s)]
*  He is a committed and I think profound [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9621.02s)]
*  and virtuous Christian. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9624.300000000001s)]
*  I'm not, we know this. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9625.7s)]
*  And yet, so we disagree and profound, [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9627.300000000001s)]
*  and yet he's one of my dearest friends. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9631.300000000001s)]
*  And we draw each other out [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9632.5s)]
*  and we contribute to each other. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9634.18s)]
*  You can disagree, you can argue, you can challenge, [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9636.140000000001s)]
*  but you don't have to pursue demonization, destruction. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9639.42s)]
*  You don't have to pursue confirmation porn. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9642.86s)]
*  You don't have to pursue narrative porn. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9644.980000000001s)]
*  You know what the narrative bias is? [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9646.86s)]
*  Narrative is, this is a real but. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9647.900000000001s)]
*  I can tell a story about that, [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9650.78s)]
*  so it must mean I know what's going on. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9651.78s)]
*  And so we get simplistic narratives, [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9654.54s)]
*  we get confirmation porn, [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9656.34s)]
*  we get this sort of self righteous, adversarial, [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9657.98s)]
*  I'm gonna destroy the other end. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9663.539999999999s)]
*  See, it shows how good I am, [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9665.5s)]
*  and it's ultimately narcissistic. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9666.58s)]
*  I don't wanna participate in any of that crap, right? [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9669.18s)]
*  And you can see I'm getting very animated. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9673.82s)]
*  I feel very strongly that, sorry, [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9677.06s)]
*  I wanna make it clear that I'm not arguing [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9683.939999999999s)]
*  against Jordan and his absence. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9685.699999999999s)]
*  I would welcome if he was here [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9688.9s)]
*  and could defend his position. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9689.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't think that we are. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9690.58s)]
*  I think I have a decent enough relationship with him, [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9691.86s)]
*  and I'm sure you have a great relationship with him, [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9694.140000000001s)]
*  so it's like, I would understand if, [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9695.380000000001s)]
*  he wouldn't be upset, I don't think. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9697.74s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9699.02s)]
*  I think he understands that we're, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9699.86s)]
*  like, he's invited me to do things, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9701.58s)]
*  like to, he's putting together a new course, [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9704.7s)]
*  Peterson Academy, and I've taught a, [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9706.74s)]
*  I've already done one course for him [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9709.26s)]
*  on intelligence, rationality, wisdom, and spirituality. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9710.78s)]
*  But when he came to, when he made the offer to me, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9714.1s)]
*  he said, well, I said, Jordan, I'm not a conservative, [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9716.98s)]
*  I'm not a Christian, and I have ideas other than yours. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9719.779999999999s)]
*  He said, first of all, you can criticize me if you want. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9723.539999999999s)]
*  You have complete academic freedom, [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9725.9s)]
*  and you don't have to be a Christian, [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9728.02s)]
*  and you don't have to tow the conservative line. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9729.58s)]
*  I just want you to come in [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9731.46s)]
*  and give the best possible course you could give. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9733.58s)]
*  And I said, okay, under those conditions, I'll do it, [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9736.58s)]
*  because why wouldn't I? [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9739.3s)]
*  That's a completely virtuous context. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9740.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9742.58s)]
*  And I hate guilt by associating. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9743.42s)]
*  Why are you associating with him? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9744.539999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9747.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's become a huge problem in America. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9747.86s)]
*  In politics overall, in society. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9749.86s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9752.58s)]
*  It's so funny, people don't even realize, [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9756.220000000001s)]
*  the guilt by association and then the little spouse, [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9758.98s)]
*  Foucault in postmodernism, who are deeply influenced, [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9762.1s)]
*  profoundly influenced by Heidegger, [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9764.98s)]
*  who was literally a Nazi. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9766.78s)]
*  It's like, where is your guilt by, [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9768.94s)]
*  how does your guilt by association metric work? [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9770.98s)]
*  It doesn't work consistently, [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9773.7s)]
*  it doesn't work coherently. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9774.9s)]
*  And I think that it's important that we give people [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9777.06s)]
*  a chance to enter into genuine dialogos with us. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9784.82s)]
*  Part of understanding forgiveness, [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9793.46s)]
*  which is an important part of agape, [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9795.9s)]
*  that's Jesus of Nazareth, [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9798.42s)]
*  is forgiveness isn't like mercy, I let you off the hook. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9800.18s)]
*  Forgiveness is, I'm giving you the chance [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9804.38s)]
*  to enter into a relationship with me, [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9807.9s)]
*  and even giving myself to enter in a chance [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9810.38s)]
*  into a relationship with you, before it has been earned. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9812.5s)]
*  Because something has happened that I can't earn it, [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9816.619999999999s)]
*  until, like I'm in a Catch-22, [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9820.06s)]
*  unless you give me the chance to enter into the relationship, [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9821.82s)]
*  I can't do the things that will allow me [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9825.06s)]
*  to re-earn your trust. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9826.779999999999s)]
*  And so you need to give me that. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9828.779999999999s)]
*  You need to forgive, [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9831.22s)]
*  I'm playing with the word a little bit, right? [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9832.300000000001s)]
*  You need to forgive, so that we're not bound [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9834.34s)]
*  in reciprocal narrowing, so there's a chance [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9838.86s)]
*  for reciprocal opening. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9841.42s)]
*  I think we've lost the commitment to that. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9843.18s)]
*  America used to, I mean, I'm a Canadian, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9848.58s)]
*  I only get it through the media, popular media, [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9851.18s)]
*  but America used to be a place, at least it seemed to me, [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9853.26s)]
*  where people were initially given the benefit of the doubt, [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9856.460000000001s)]
*  because you were all Americans [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9859.300000000001s)]
*  and you all believed in democracy. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9860.5s)]
*  As far as I can tell now, I mean, there's research [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9862.3s)]
*  to show this, you know, Republicans are more afraid [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9864.5s)]
*  of Democrats than they are of China, and vice versa. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9867.1s)]
*  And nobody believes in democracy anymore. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9870.3s)]
*  Everybody's convinced on both sides, [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9873.38s)]
*  this, like, I'm in this to win, [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9875.38s)]
*  not to make America better, right? [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9878.3s)]
*  And so, I mean, I hesitate. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9880.38s)]
*  That's a great point. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9882.22s)]
*  Well, you're an American, and I'm glad you're nodding [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9883.3s)]
*  to that, because I feel a little bit weird here commenting. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9885.42s)]
*  No, well, I think that's a great point. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9887.66s)]
*  I hadn't really thought about that. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9888.98s)]
*  Everybody's in it to win. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9890.1s)]
*  They're not in it for how do we get out of this? [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9891.26s)]
*  How do we get to a better place? [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9894.58s)]
*  How can we all get to a place together [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9896.58s)]
*  that we could not possibly get to on our own? [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9898.74s)]
*  That was the proposal of democracy. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9901.02s)]
*  The proposal of democracy is we will all engage [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9904.34s)]
*  in self-deception, but if you have a different point of view, [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9906.7s)]
*  and I'm willing to enter into genuine idea logos with you, [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9910.74s)]
*  you can help me correct mine, [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9914.18s)]
*  and I can help you correct yours. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9915.66s)]
*  And we can get to a place together [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9917.380000000001s)]
*  that we couldn't get to on our own. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9919.06s)]
*  That is the great promise of democracy. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9920.699999999999s)]
*  It's also the great promise of science. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9922.699999999999s)]
*  John Dewey, one of your great philosophers, [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9924.26s)]
*  said those two, when they're both working, [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9926.9s)]
*  they work together profoundly. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9929.42s)]
*  That's what America was. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9931.46s)]
*  Well, at least to my mind. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9933.3s)]
*  Yeah, and did he do the Dewey Decimal System? [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9934.38s)]
*  Yes, that's that John Dewey. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9936.939999999999s)]
*  I knew it, dude. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9938.06s)]
*  I knew he frickin' did it. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9939.46s)]
*  God, I can't believe some weirdo would do that, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9942.019999999999s)]
*  but I'm grateful he did it. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9943.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9944.9s)]
*  Because I needed to get those books. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9945.779999999999s)]
*  I wonder if you saw this, John, it says, [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9949.26s)]
*  the moon is open for business. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9950.18s)]
*  Entrepreneurs are racing to make billions. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9951.42s)]
*  That they're gonna, basically, [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9954.3s)]
*  they're planning on opening the moon [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9955.22s)]
*  where people can go there and have like a little colony. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9956.699999999999s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9959.5s)]
*  Like as if the moon's gonna become the new, like, [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9962.82s)]
*  you know, we're heading, we're the Mayflower, you know? [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9966.26s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, that's, [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9969.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's part of what's happened [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9972.859999999999s)]
*  to the American mythos, right? [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9975.14s)]
*  Is the frontier, the new world, the frontier. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9977.9s)]
*  When it's gone now, I mean, there's nowhere left to go. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9982.66s)]
*  Right, and Star Trek tried to propose [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9984.5s)]
*  that space would be the final frontier, [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9986.82s)]
*  and we're still playing with that, [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9988.22s)]
*  but the problem is, space isn't the same way [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9989.1s)]
*  as another continent, right? [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9992.06s)]
*  And yeah, I think America is, [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=9994.58s)]
*  I hadn't thought about this, sorry, [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10000.46s)]
*  this is just coming to me. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10001.699999999999s)]
*  No, it's okay, it's just the news. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10002.9s)]
*  It says, with its Artemis missions, [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10004.18s)]
*  the US space agency aims to lay the foundations [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10007.9s)]
*  for the first human settlements beyond Earth [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10010.26s)]
*  and pave the way for extra planetary colonization, [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10012.460000000001s)]
*  and that business is at the core of its strategy. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10016.14s)]
*  So I've wondered about this, [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10019.34s)]
*  maybe there's a hunger in America for another frontier. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10022.66s)]
*  I could see that. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10026.82s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe trying to make that happen. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10027.82s)]
*  I, yeah, there's been some historians who talked about that [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10032.14s)]
*  and how the frontier kept moving [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10037.380000000001s)]
*  until they hit sort of the Pacific Ocean, [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10038.82s)]
*  and then there was a problem because, [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10041.220000000001s)]
*  this is over simplistic, but generally what happened is, [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10043.42s)]
*  people who were relatively more stable [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10046.26s)]
*  and were more sociable stayed, [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10049.460000000001s)]
*  and people that were a little bit fringe [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10052.1s)]
*  would move to the frontier, and then they kept moving, [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10054.62s)]
*  and they kept moving, and then they end up in California, [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10057.02s)]
*  kind of thing. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10059.26s)]
*  And then they end up in Australia. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10060.1s)]
*  Yeah, or Australia, right? [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10061.58s)]
*  And then the problem is, right, we lost that, [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10063.26s)]
*  or the United States, Canada didn't grow up that way, [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10068.82s)]
*  but the United States lost that ability, [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10071.66s)]
*  it lost that vision. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10073.54s)]
*  Yeah, maybe there's even a bit of a spiritual dimension [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10074.94s)]
*  to this, there's a trying to attempt to get a sense of, [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10079.86s)]
*  well, there's a frontier we can open up, [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10085.86s)]
*  we can orient towards. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10088.580000000002s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10091.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, it just makes me wonder, [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10092.980000000001s)]
*  if it's just a money thing so that rich people [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10096.660000000002s)]
*  could look cool and take pictures on the moon, [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10098.900000000001s)]
*  I guess you could open up maybe a nice restaurant there [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10103.460000000001s)]
*  that only really rich people could go to. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10106.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if it's just a business thing, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10108.94s)]
*  and all we're doing is sort of flinging phalluses [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10111.34s)]
*  into the sky, like we've been doing recently, [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10113.660000000002s)]
*  yeah, that's just having, that's just modal confusion. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10116.82s)]
*  It's just trying to have sex with the universe. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10120.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it feels like to me, [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10123.78s)]
*  a little bit of a weird kind of like, [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10125.42s)]
*  let's inflict ourselves onto the world [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10127.5s)]
*  because we can afford it. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10130.7s)]
*  One of the rockets even looked like a penis, [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10131.66s)]
*  it was really embarrassing. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10133.26s)]
*  Really? [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10134.34s)]
*  Somebody with psychological training, [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10135.18s)]
*  I'm looking at this and going, like, that's a penis, [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10136.02s)]
*  and you're thrusting it into the sky, right? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10138.7s)]
*  And it's really weird. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10141.220000000001s)]
*  So yeah, you're right, it could become that, [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10144.06s)]
*  but if it becomes Plymouth, [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10146.42s)]
*  if it becomes a stepping stone [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10150.939999999999s)]
*  to maybe opening up colonization of other planets, [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10152.699999999999s)]
*  then that could become something other, I don't know. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10157.019999999999s)]
*  There it is right there, Blue Origin. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10160.38s)]
*  There you go, see what I mean? [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10162.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that thing. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10163.859999999999s)]
*  Somebody just slinging a wean right into space, homie. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10166.58s)]
*  Well, it's, you know, my dick's bigger than yours [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10169.82s)]
*  kind of thing. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10172.66s)]
*  Oh, yes, yeah. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10173.5s)]
*  Who doesn't wanna just rip their wiener off [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10174.339999999998s)]
*  and just hum it into the damn ether? [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10175.98s)]
*  You know? [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10178.9s)]
*  I remember at one point I hated my penis for some reason. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10181.779999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10184.699999999999s)]
*  And I remember I wanted to cut it off [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10185.539999999999s)]
*  and mail it to Africa, to like a starving country, [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10187.5s)]
*  and they could use it for a food. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10191.82s)]
*  Isn't that crazy to think that? [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10193.14s)]
*  Well, maybe, but I mean, a lot of people get into [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10196.259999999998s)]
*  very ambivalent relationships to their sexuality [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10200.98s)]
*  and to their genitals. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10204.94s)]
*  Has that happened over time, you think, a lot of folks? [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10209.18s)]
*  I think it's a perennial thing about human beings. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10211.58s)]
*  I think human beings, right, sex pulls us [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10214.06s)]
*  in the two directions. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10218.859999999999s)]
*  Sex pulls us towards the animal, the finite. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10219.82s)]
*  We're having sex because we're finite, we're limited, [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10223.98s)]
*  we're trying to make more kids, right? [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10225.9s)]
*  But sex can also call us, and you talked about this, [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10228.58s)]
*  there's a possibility of ecstasy, there's a possibility, [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10233.1s)]
*  like, and you have like tantra, which is, right, [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10235.9s)]
*  people understanding that sex is a powerful way [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10239.14s)]
*  to reciprocally open with another human being, [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10243.06s)]
*  and if you frame it the right way, you can go into ecstasy, [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10245.14s)]
*  you can go into self-transcendence, [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10247.539999999999s)]
*  you can touch aspects of your psyche [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10249.34s)]
*  that are otherwise inaccessible. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10254.38s)]
*  And so we've always understood, I think, [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10256.34s)]
*  that sex is a powerful thing, [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10259.380000000001s)]
*  and it's got this tension in it, [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10263.78s)]
*  and one of the ways we try to just alleviate that tension [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10267.94s)]
*  is just, well, I'm just gonna collapse [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10270.7s)]
*  to one side or the other. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10272.82s)]
*  We'll just, right, we'll just do the one, [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10274.14s)]
*  or we'll just do the other. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10276.94s)]
*  And again, it's play-doh to my mind. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10278.86s)]
*  Like, the toughest thing for me to be, to do, [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10281.98s)]
*  loving wisely, insofar as I have, [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10286.58s)]
*  is to hold those two together about my sexuality, right? [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10289.86s)]
*  Is to acknowledge the animal part, [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10293.5s)]
*  but don't identify with it, [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10296.02s)]
*  and to acknowledge the ecstatic part, [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10298.380000000001s)]
*  but don't think I'm a god and identify with it, [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10300.3s)]
*  but try and keep the two talking to each other all the time. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10302.7s)]
*  Mm. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10306.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think I had just gotten so disappointed. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10308.18s)]
*  Like, I think, because in my 20s, [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10310.460000000001s)]
*  I was looking at pornography a lot, you know? [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10312.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10315.06s)]
*  Oh, I could see that, yeah. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10316.46s)]
*  Over going on a date or something. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10317.699999999999s)]
*  Because it was less committal, [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10319.779999999999s)]
*  it was way less scary than possibly disappointing a woman [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10322.94s)]
*  or possibly getting into a relationship even. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10326.699999999999s)]
*  Like, even if I had appeased a woman [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10330.46s)]
*  and then things got closer, that was very scary. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10332.06s)]
*  And I remember, yeah, at one point, [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10335.98s)]
*  I was just so sick of myself, I was like, [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10337.699999999999s)]
*  I will just, just male my penis. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10340.5s)]
*  And I guess I thought Africa, [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10344.1s)]
*  because it was like a starving country or something, [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10345.1s)]
*  they could use it as like a soup, meat or whatever. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10346.66s)]
*  But just to put you in some august company, [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10348.86s)]
*  St. Paul talked about cutting off your left hand, [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10354.18s)]
*  and Jesus did too, if it offends you, right? [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10357.140000000001s)]
*  We can misidentify with our body or parts of our body [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10360.54s)]
*  in a way like you just described, [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10365.5s)]
*  and thank you for sharing that, [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10366.94s)]
*  that can really narrow us down, reciprocally bind us, [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10368.42s)]
*  get us locked in, and we can feel trapped. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10370.94s)]
*  And we feel like the only way out, [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10373.62s)]
*  remember Eric Fromm, is to destroy. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10375.1s)]
*  That is to destroy, right? [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10376.9s)]
*  Now, I'm glad you're not there, [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10379.86s)]
*  and I'm really glad you got out of that [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10383.34s)]
*  without having to damage yourself. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10385.94s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10387.22s)]
*  I think there were just times where I was like, [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10388.22s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking hum this thing over the fence. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10389.86s)]
*  Just because you just wanted to get rid of it, [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10393.02s)]
*  it felt like the cause of your pain. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10394.46s)]
*  Oh, I remember saying something [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10396.42s)]
*  not quite as self-mutilating as that, [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10398.78s)]
*  but I remember saying for the longest time, [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10401.22s)]
*  if there was a button I could push [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10404.339999999998s)]
*  and it would turn off my sexuality [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10405.419999999998s)]
*  and leave everything else in place, [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10406.98s)]
*  I'd push that button. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10408.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10409.06s)]
*  I won't push that button now. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10409.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10411.419999999998s)]
*  I won't push that button now, it's different. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10412.259999999998s)]
*  And that's again the gift that has been given to me [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10414.099999999999s)]
*  by other people, especially by my, [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10416.939999999999s)]
*  this wonderful woman that I'm with. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10420.3s)]
*  And so, yeah, I can understand that, [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10423.699999999999s)]
*  I can understand how you can get to that place. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10427.699999999999s)]
*  But I think the rocket is also [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10429.46s)]
*  an objected version of that. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10431.580000000002s)]
*  Oh, it's like us just trying to show off. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10433.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems like rich people [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10434.86s)]
*  are doing a lot of their own space. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10436.26s)]
*  It's like everything has become very privatized. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10438.94s)]
*  That's one thing that kinda scares me. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10441.220000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, and then we're losing the we. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10443.02s)]
*  We're losing what can we do together [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10445.42s)]
*  and get to a place that we couldn't get on our own. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10447.660000000002s)]
*  And flinging the phallus into the sky [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10449.740000000002s)]
*  is a way of saying, I can get there on my own. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10451.78s)]
*  And the problem is, I bet you can, but so what? [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10454.18s)]
*  The price you pay for that is, [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10458.7s)]
*  you haven't brought everyone else along, [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10461.9s)]
*  and then once you get there, you've lost that capacity [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10463.14s)]
*  that only civilization has. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10466.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're there by yourself. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10468.22s)]
*  You're there by yourself, and you lose all of what, [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10469.5s)]
*  all the often frustrating, but also the wonderful ways [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10475.46s)]
*  in which human beings challenge us beyond ourselves, [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10479.019999999999s)]
*  other human beings. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10481.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's like even, [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10482.34s)]
*  yeah, it's like even like the Olympics and stuff, [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10486.179999999998s)]
*  everybody's like, it takes different sides [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10488.06s)]
*  and points of views. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10490.22s)]
*  It used to just be, you cheer for your team. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10491.06s)]
*  I wonder if it's like that in other countries [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10494.14s)]
*  or if it's just America doing all this bullshit. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10495.58s)]
*  Well, I mean, the problem was the Olympics also, [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10498.3s)]
*  I mean, they got corrupted by politics. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10501.42s)]
*  I mean, it's even back, 36 Olympics, [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10504.179999999998s)]
*  and they're in Berlin and Hitler's, [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10506.779999999999s)]
*  the Nazis are running the Olympics. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10510.34s)]
*  Oh. Right? [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10512.34s)]
*  And then you got, the Olympics got corrupted [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10513.22s)]
*  by the Cold War. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10516.019999999999s)]
*  Right, and- [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10518.14s)]
*  So they've always been pretty fallible to, [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10518.98s)]
*  somebody taking them out, like- [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10521.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, whenever there's an arena [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10523.619999999999s)]
*  in which human excellence could come to the fore, [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10525.82s)]
*  there are also people who want to grab the shiny thing [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10528.42s)]
*  and bullshit you with it and manipulate you around it. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10531.14s)]
*  That's always gonna be the case. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10534.939999999999s)]
*  And that's a perennial problem. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10538.5s)]
*  And so, again, the answer to that is not, [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10540.58s)]
*  let's win that game, to my mind. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10545.7s)]
*  The answer is, let's stop playing that game together. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10548.7s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like that's a thing that's really been, [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10553.22s)]
*  that's gotten rough in America is, [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10557.5s)]
*  I mean, for one, our news, the faith in our news dissolved. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10559.46s)]
*  Yeah, the legacy media has no legitimacy. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10563.42s)]
*  And I mean, it happened like that, I felt like. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10566.06s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong, but it felt like it happened. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10568.86s)]
*  Well, the cable, like you said a long time ago, [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10570.58s)]
*  the cable fragmented the networks, right? [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10572.7s)]
*  And so, when you don't have a consensus out there, [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10575.300000000001s)]
*  when you don't have a listening consensus, [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10577.5s)]
*  that doesn't get reflected back [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10579.62s)]
*  as a consensus authority figure. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10581.1s)]
*  When you're Walter Cronkite, [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10583.34s)]
*  and so many people are listening to you, [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10584.7s)]
*  and they're all sharing that together, [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10588.02s)]
*  a lot of trust gets placed in you by a lot of people. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10589.7s)]
*  When you're on some little cable thing, right, [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10592.460000000001s)]
*  then that's 24 hours a day. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10595.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then it, so, you know, [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10596.66s)]
*  CNN changed things. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10599.1s)]
*  I remember when I was watching CNN when it first came on, [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10600.74s)]
*  and I got like a shiver went through me. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10603.54s)]
*  I was watching it, and I realized, [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10605.380000000001s)]
*  the journalists are interviewing each other. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10608.140000000001s)]
*  I grew up with journalism when the journalists [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10610.42s)]
*  went to where the story was and interviewed the people [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10612.060000000001s)]
*  that the story was happening to. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10614.34s)]
*  And I'm watching CNN, and it's, they're talking to each other. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10615.54s)]
*  And I go, oh no, this is really bad. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10618.220000000001s)]
*  This is gonna isolate itself more and more and more, [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10623.18s)]
*  and become more and more about itself [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10626.820000000002s)]
*  very, very rapidly kind of thing. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10628.18s)]
*  And it has, I used to watch CNN, [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10630.460000000001s)]
*  I thought it was like the place I would go for news. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10631.82s)]
*  And then like, I think five years ago or something, [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10634.3s)]
*  I was like, I don't, this just isn't news anymore. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10636.3s)]
*  I don't know, but the news lost itself. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10638.98s)]
*  And so then conspiracy theories grew. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10640.9s)]
*  They filled the vacuum. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10642.779999999999s)]
*  Because of course people are trying to figure out [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10644.02s)]
*  the reality of news. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10645.86s)]
*  They're trying to figure out real information. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10647.3s)]
*  So I guess people are searching for real information. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10649.539999999999s)]
*  You know, they're trying to figure it out. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10653.58s)]
*  Well, what the spirituality shows you though, [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10655.02s)]
*  at least I would argue this, [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10657.46s)]
*  is they're not just searching for information, for facts. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10658.94s)]
*  They're searching for meaning. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10661.9s)]
*  They're searching for belonging. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10663.5s)]
*  They're searching for connection. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10664.54s)]
*  Like Socrates, they don't want just empty truths. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10666.220000000001s)]
*  They want transformative truths. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10668.34s)]
*  And that's why, like if you've, like, [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10669.9s)]
*  if you watch like a QAnon meeting, you know, [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10673.34s)]
*  yeah, there'll be the conspiracy language, [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10677.140000000001s)]
*  but it looks like a church service. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10680.26s)]
*  They have like, there's songs, [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10681.62s)]
*  and then there's somebody gives like a sermon, [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10684.18s)]
*  and then they're supporting each other, [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10686.220000000001s)]
*  and they're offering childcare. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10688.5s)]
*  And it's like, and you, like it's like, [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10690.179999999998s)]
*  like I'm not condoning anything here, [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10692.779999999999s)]
*  but it's like, as a scientist, I look at that and I go, [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10694.14s)]
*  you know, they're creating a new religion. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10697.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10701.22s)]
*  Because what people want is they don't just want the facts. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10702.06s)]
*  Right? [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10705.38s)]
*  They want the facts that connect them to themselves, [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10706.22s)]
*  to each other, to the world, and to what's ultimate. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10709.34s)]
*  In a lot of cultures are in a lot of like, [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10712.98s)]
*  you know, America's become extremely diverse. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10715.46s)]
*  You know, you have a lot of diversity issues [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10718.9s)]
*  like in France right now, like where. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10719.82s)]
*  Canada too. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10721.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10722.58s)]
*  Is it, is that just a phase that we go through [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10723.42s)]
*  as places diversify, like schools of thought changing? [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10727.5s)]
*  Like, are we eroding sometimes, [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10732.06s)]
*  or are we evolving, do you feel like? [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10734.18s)]
*  That's where I sometimes wonder like, [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10736.019999999999s)]
*  you know, is diversification, [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10738.539999999999s)]
*  is it too soon in some of these places? [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10740.779999999999s)]
*  Is it, not is it right or is it wrong, [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10743.019999999999s)]
*  because it is what it is, you know? [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10745.62s)]
*  But what is the byproducts of that, [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10749.060000000001s)]
*  and because some of it seems to be [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10751.78s)]
*  kind of scary in some spots, you know? [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10753.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10756.5s)]
*  And it may be too big of a fish to fry, you know? [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10758.900000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, calm community, calm and unity. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10761.820000000002s)]
*  The problem we're facing is we've, [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10765.5s)]
*  I think for good reasons, we've realized [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10768.900000000001s)]
*  that we've marginalized groups of people unfairly, [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10772.18s)]
*  we've disenfranchised them, they haven't been included, [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10775.7s)]
*  they have valuable things to say. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10778.06s)]
*  Somebody, I'm recording some episodes with Greg Thomas, [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10782.66s)]
*  he's a black man and he's been teaching me [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10787.14s)]
*  how much jazz and the blues contributed to American culture, [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10790.26s)]
*  to American democracy, it's been really, [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10793.66s)]
*  that series is gonna come out eventually. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10795.9s)]
*  Yeah, we just went to Graceland the other day, so. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10797.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and so, right, and he talks about [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10799.460000000001s)]
*  being an omni-American and being a radical moderate, [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10802.14s)]
*  or like, and talking about a cultural worldview [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10805.58s)]
*  rather than a racialized worldview. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10809.019999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I applaud his courage, [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10811.939999999999s)]
*  because it's difficult to make these things [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10814.18s)]
*  and make these kinds of statements, [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10816.74s)]
*  but I think what he's putting his finger on is, [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10819.34s)]
*  yeah, we have to do this thing, [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10822.3s)]
*  we have to stop hurting people just because of who they are, [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10824.58s)]
*  and I firmly agree with that, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10830.02s)]
*  but we haven't been, [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10832.34s)]
*  we haven't, remember the ecology of practices, [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10834.42s)]
*  we haven't been counterbalancing that with, [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10836.5s)]
*  okay, good, let's do that, but what we need to do [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10838.7s)]
*  is we need to balance that with, [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10841.62s)]
*  what are we doing to strengthen community? [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10843.1s)]
*  This is called complexification, [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10845.42s)]
*  so let me give you a biological example of this. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10846.82s)]
*  You and I started out as a zygote, a fertilized egg. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10849.7s)]
*  Initially, the egg just, the cells just reproduce, [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10852.26s)]
*  but you know, then they start to do something. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10855.06s)]
*  They start to differentiate, [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10857.539999999999s)]
*  they start to become skin cells [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10858.78s)]
*  and lung cells and hearts. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10860.140000000001s)]
*  So, right, differentiation. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10861.74s)]
*  Do they fight a little or not? [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10863.86s)]
*  Well, here's the thing, but that's the thing. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10865.02s)]
*  While they are differentiating, [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10867.060000000001s)]
*  they are simultaneously, literally self-organ, [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10869.5s)]
*  self-organizing, they're also organizing into organs, [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10872.300000000001s)]
*  and so a living thing is simultaneously differentiating [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10875.78s)]
*  and integrating, and when I am, look at my hand, [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10880.94s)]
*  my hand is very differentiated, but it's also integrated, [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10884.1s)]
*  and when it does both of those, it complexifies. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10888.98s)]
*  It gets emergent abilities, emergent powers, [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10891.82s)]
*  and if you only integrate, you get stultifying stillness, [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10894.94s)]
*  and if you only diversify, you get frustrating fragmentation. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10899.5s)]
*  You need to have them properly integrated, right, [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10903.9s)]
*  so that you get complexification. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10907.42s)]
*  I think we should be, I'm not saying we should stop [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10910.1s)]
*  pursuing the diversification that we're doing. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10913.300000000001s)]
*  There are good moral arguments for doing this, [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10916.5s)]
*  and there's even good cultural arguments, right, [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10919.54s)]
*  but what we actually should be pursuing is [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10922.02s)]
*  complexification of our culture, which means we should also [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10925.3s)]
*  be countering balancing that with yes, [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10928.58s)]
*  but what binds us together, and simple liberal tolerance [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10930.62s)]
*  doesn't do it, it's not enough, it's thin soup, [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10935.5s)]
*  and we've lost the civic religions, [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10939.02s)]
*  we've lost the sacred religions, [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10942.78s)]
*  we've even lost a shared popular culture, [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10945.220000000001s)]
*  and just being taught, you know, well, [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10947.66s)]
*  let's just all be nice, that's not, that's not. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10949.62s)]
*  That's not realistic. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10952.58s)]
*  It's not enough. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10953.42s)]
*  It's not enough. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10954.380000000001s)]
*  You need a shared vision, again, I want everybody [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10955.220000000001s)]
*  to hear what I'm saying, pursue the diversification. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10958.54s)]
*  This is. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10961.220000000001s)]
*  Oh, I hear it totally. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10962.06s)]
*  That's right, but it also needs to be counterbalanced with, [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10962.9s)]
*  also pursue the integration so that we complexify, [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10966.02s)]
*  so that we literally grow and have emergent abilities [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10969.220000000001s)]
*  to deal with the problems that we're all [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10972.78s)]
*  collectively sharing. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10975.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10976.74s)]
*  I mean, you know, I'm a, my father's from Nicaragua, [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10978.060000000001s)]
*  and I'm mostly viewed as just a white guy, you know? [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10980.900000000001s)]
*  But it's been like, it definitely feels like they've made [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10984.86s)]
*  just white, a lot of times the media, it feels like, [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10988.54s)]
*  I'm not saying this is real, but it feels like, [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10991.26s)]
*  and I have friends that feel like that, [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10994.78s)]
*  that like white Christian men are just made to be like [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10996.54s)]
*  the enemy, you know, and that they've never done [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=10998.980000000001s)]
*  anything good. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11001.78s)]
*  Demonizing people will always end up bad. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11003.140000000001s)]
*  It's been horrible, because there's so many good people [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11005.380000000001s)]
*  that now start to say, okay, you wanna make me the enemy, [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11008.1s)]
*  then that's what I'll be. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11012.18s)]
*  It's almost like, not that's what I'll be, [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11013.66s)]
*  but then I'm gonna separate myself from this society [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11016.1s)]
*  because I'm not even respected in it. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11019.74s)]
*  Yeah, my son. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11021.86s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11022.7s)]
*  Yeah, it makes direct sense to me as a father. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11023.52s)]
*  My son was in a program in which he would come home [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11026.74s)]
*  and he would feel dejected because he was demonized [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11030.5s)]
*  that way, and at one point he said, well, you know what? [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11033.82s)]
*  And this is the effect this had on him. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11039.14s)]
*  I'm gonna join the right because at least they'll work [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11041.22s)]
*  on my behalf and they'll stop demonizing me. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11044.46s)]
*  And I had to sit him down, I said, son, don't do that. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11046.82s)]
*  Like, you're giving in to, like, the shadow side [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11049.9s)]
*  of what's happening to you is coming out. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11052.74s)]
*  But I, like, I had empathy. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11054.54s)]
*  I get, like, if you're demonizing somebody, [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11056.46s)]
*  do we really think that, oh, you've made me feel [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11059.460000000001s)]
*  really horrible and guilty about myself for, like, [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11063.18s)]
*  all, a long time, I'm just gonna join your cause. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11065.900000000001s)]
*  No, some people will do that because they'll give in. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11069.86s)]
*  But a lot of people are gonna give that the finger [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11073.060000000001s)]
*  and they're gonna fight back because, like, [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11075.460000000001s)]
*  you can't do that with people. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11079.300000000001s)]
*  So we, again, we've gotta get the balance. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11081.78s)]
*  How can we take responsibility for what has happened [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11083.78s)]
*  without just transferring the group [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11087.9s)]
*  that we're going to hate, right? [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11090.74s)]
*  And this is a really tricky problem. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11092.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's very complex. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11096.619999999999s)]
*  It's very hard and, like, I applaud people like Greg. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11098.06s)]
*  I'm mostly, on this issue, I feel that I don't have [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11103.14s)]
*  the requisite education or expertise. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11107.46s)]
*  And I also feel that, you know, I'm not the right person to, [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11110.5s)]
*  so I'm trying to really, really listen to people [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11114.9s)]
*  who I think do have the proper place and role [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11120.82s)]
*  to try and wrestle with this [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11125.26s)]
*  and learn from them as best I can. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11126.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11128.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that's always a good idea, you know? [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11129.94s)]
*  I mean, it's just, it's nice to think about and talk about. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11132.3s)]
*  We should. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11136.42s)]
*  It's nice to be able to share that thought [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11137.26s)]
*  and just have it be discussed or heard or whatever, you know? [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11139.02s)]
*  And I think we should. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11144.62s)]
*  I don't think, I think making things, [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11145.54s)]
*  topics that we can't discuss, that we need to discuss, [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11148.94s)]
*  is really problematizing things for a lot of people. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11151.58s)]
*  Problems don't go away by talking about them [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11155.62s)]
*  as if they don't exist, right? [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11158.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and you create people that are, [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11159.82s)]
*  then you get people into fear. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11163.300000000001s)]
*  So I know an increasing number of people who are, [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11165.460000000001s)]
*  I can see that the fires of resentment are building in them [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11170.1s)]
*  and it's dangerous. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11174.300000000001s)]
*  It's like, this is like the Weimar Republic, right? [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11175.58s)]
*  The Versailles Treaty will crush the enemy into the dust [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11178.9s)]
*  because they're demons, and you just, [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11182.02s)]
*  you end up breeding a demon that's 10 times worse. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11184.220000000001s)]
*  So I hope that we can get to a place where we can do that, [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11188.86s)]
*  we can do the kind of thing that you and I are trying [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11194.9s)]
*  to do here where we can do this, like, you know, [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11196.94s)]
*  this dialogos conversation where we wrestle with things [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11201.26s)]
*  and we do it honestly and people are allowed to make mistakes [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11205.78s)]
*  without immediately being condemned. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11208.62s)]
*  Like, people are so afraid to make a mistake. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11210.9s)]
*  You can't learn if you can't make mistakes. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11212.74s)]
*  Like, people have to be able to make mistakes and say, [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11216.78s)]
*  oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize, like, oh yeah, [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11219.1s)]
*  maybe that was a racist thing. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11221.460000000001s)]
*  I didn't know, right? [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11222.7s)]
*  I really honestly didn't know. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11224.18s)]
*  Can you accept that I didn't know? [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11225.300000000001s)]
*  And then can you help me? [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11227.699999999999s)]
*  But if we get to a place where you can't make mistakes, [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11228.779999999999s)]
*  then you can't learn, and like, it feels in a lot of places [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11231.38s)]
*  people are walking on eggshells and everybody's terrified [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11235.06s)]
*  about making a mistake, and then everything gets [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11238.02s)]
*  this chilly, superficial kind of conversation, [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11240.86s)]
*  and then we can't solve any of these problems. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11244.66s)]
*  Well, I think it's kind of where Hollywood [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11248.66s)]
*  has kind of pigeonholed itself with some of its creations [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11249.9s)]
*  these days. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11253.22s)]
*  And they're paying the price. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11254.06s)]
*  So they're claiming that this is what everybody believes, [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11254.9s)]
*  and then the box office is repeatedly telling them, [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11258.1s)]
*  no, they don't, and they resent it, [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11260.779999999999s)]
*  and they're not listening. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11263.06s)]
*  Well, it's almost like they have, like, [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11264.66s)]
*  they're trying to create Stockholm syndrome [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11266.26s)]
*  with their audiences, you know? [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11268.58s)]
*  Not that they need to be one way or the other, [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11271.22s)]
*  but just that, can we have some reality? [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11273.74s)]
*  Because what gets to be scary is, as a regular person, [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11276.619999999999s)]
*  you start to question your own fucking reality. [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11279.82s)]
*  You're like, am I? [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11282.74s)]
*  There's no way that I'm insane suddenly, you know? [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11284.82s)]
*  We should go back to making great stories [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11289.94s)]
*  that are great myth, that afford people being imaginal, [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11295.86s)]
*  that call them to wisdom and virtue, [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11300.539999999999s)]
*  and then within that, ask them to consider issues of race [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11302.34s)]
*  and gender and economic status, [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11307.82s)]
*  rather than hitting people over the head [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11310.42s)]
*  with condemning messages or very superficial representation [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11313.42s)]
*  so that people watch this and they say, [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11318.34s)]
*  this is boring, or I'm tired of getting preached at. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11320.38s)]
*  Like, again, like, here's, like, right here, [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11323.86s)]
*  there's a point I wanna make. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11328.460000000001s)]
*  We should be able to criticize the method [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11329.98s)]
*  without automatically being told [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11332.34s)]
*  that we are criticizing the goal. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11336.1s)]
*  I think this, should we reduce racism and racial tension? [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11338.94s)]
*  Should we make things more fair [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11343.34s)]
*  between the sexes and the genders? [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11345.619999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11348.34s)]
*  And because I really believe that, [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11350.26s)]
*  I think there are good and bad ways of doing that, [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11352.3s)]
*  and we should be able to work together, [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11355.5s)]
*  and I could be wrong, and you could be wrong, [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11357.46s)]
*  and we should be able to criticize the methods [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11359.3s)]
*  if we actually believed in the goal. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11362.619999999999s)]
*  If we didn't believe, if we actually believe in the goal, [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11364.14s)]
*  if we actually believe in helping the people, [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11366.42s)]
*  we should be able to criticize the methods like science does. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11368.34s)]
*  Right, instead of, right, no, [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11374.14s)]
*  actually I just wanna plant my flag, right? [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11376.259999999998s)]
*  And so, it's... [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11379.5s)]
*  No, it's a great point. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11382.939999999999s)]
*  We should be able to criticize the methods [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11384.46s)]
*  without saying we're criticizing the goal. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11385.82s)]
*  And it's gotten to the point now [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11388.179999999998s)]
*  where you can't even raise your hand and ask a question [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11389.06s)]
*  without being lambasted so much in society or online [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11391.66s)]
*  that it gets debilitating to any real conversation. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11395.58s)]
*  Yeah, and again, I would say that, [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11401.14s)]
*  I think I can honestly say that, [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11404.42s)]
*  I would say that equally to the left and the right. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11405.539999999999s)]
*  Let me criticize the methods, [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11407.9s)]
*  and it doesn't mean I'm necessarily criticizing the goal. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11410.3s)]
*  I agree with the left. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11412.98s)]
*  Your goals of making the world more compassionate, [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11414.26s)]
*  not making people the victims of fate, [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11417.74s)]
*  the fate of race or the fate of the economic class. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11419.98s)]
*  Yeah, they keep doing that. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11422.7s)]
*  Right, keep doing that. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11424.1s)]
*  But also, I get the... [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11424.980000000001s)]
*  Well, they keep doing that over and it's like, [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11426.18s)]
*  come on, we've heard this story a million times. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11427.54s)]
*  Well, but... [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11429.78s)]
*  When are people gonna start to live a new truth [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11430.62s)]
*  unless you start to tell them a new story? [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11432.220000000001s)]
*  But that's it. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11433.86s)]
*  It's like, that should never stop [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11435.18s)]
*  because that's a perennial thing. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11437.94s)]
*  Human beings are all... [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11438.980000000001s)]
*  But you have to have the method [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11440.26s)]
*  that doesn't dull people to it. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11442.060000000001s)]
*  And I also wanna say this to the right. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11444.62s)]
*  You're supposed to be calling people [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11446.060000000001s)]
*  to personal responsibility and virtue. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11448.42s)]
*  Are your leaders exemplars of virtue [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11451.02s)]
*  and personal responsibility? [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11455.859999999999s)]
*  They don't seem to be, right? [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11457.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11459.58s)]
*  I agree with your goals. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11460.42s)]
*  Are your methods... [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11461.26s)]
*  You know how you convince people to pursue virtue? [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11462.66s)]
*  Be as virtuous as you can. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11465.66s)]
*  Exemplify it. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11467.619999999999s)]
*  Be like Socrates. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11468.46s)]
*  Be like Siddhartha. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11470.02s)]
*  Be like Jesus. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11470.859999999999s)]
*  Right? [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11472.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11473.14s)]
*  So, I'm sorry. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11473.98s)]
*  I'm probably pissing everybody off [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11474.82s)]
*  because I'm criticizing both the left and the right. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11476.34s)]
*  No, I don't think... [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11478.1s)]
*  Look, I think those are challenges that everybody faces. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11478.94s)]
*  And when your back's against the wall [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11481.859999999999s)]
*  or your back is against the wall, [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11483.34s)]
*  whoever that may be, [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11484.9s)]
*  you're going to retaliate more than you are [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11486.5s)]
*  entertained, if that makes sense. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11495.74s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11497.62s)]
*  So I think, and a lot of people are feeling that way. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11498.78s)]
*  It's interesting how so many groups at the same time [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11501.86s)]
*  can feel that way. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11504.1s)]
*  That's what's kind of interesting to me. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11504.94s)]
*  They can have opposite beliefs [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11506.5s)]
*  and be almost exactly in their behavior. [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11508.18s)]
*  And that is, as a psychologist and cognitive scientist, [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11511.140000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, this sounds arrogant. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11516.78s)]
*  I don't mean it to be, but it's so apparent to me. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11517.78s)]
*  It's like you're both acting the exact same way. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11519.58s)]
*  And both sides will like, oh no, we're out, we're out. [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11522.5s)]
*  They're yelling right now at me. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11525.220000000001s)]
*  But it's like, you're saying opposite. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11526.26s)]
*  I hear you saying and shouting opposite things, [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11529.1s)]
*  but you seem to be acting in this [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11531.86s)]
*  almost the exact same way. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11533.58s)]
*  And so that, for me, [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11537.42s)]
*  that's a sign that, well, that's a sign that we're in trouble. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11539.699999999999s)]
*  That's a sign that we don't even have debate. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11543.22s)]
*  We've lost the logos. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11548.3s)]
*  We've even lost debate. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11549.98s)]
*  We've just got sort of verbal rugby or something going on. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11551.619999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11555.38s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11556.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11557.98s)]
*  I think it really is. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11558.98s)]
*  I saw in some of your work you talk about psychedelics [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11561.46s)]
*  and psychedelic issues. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11564.02s)]
*  And the value of that in getting people to be able to access [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11565.78s)]
*  and help solve issues that are inside of them, trauma. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11571.619999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes. Right? [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11576.22s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11577.18s)]
*  Have you had experience with it? [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11578.02s)]
*  I've done psychedelics in my past. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11579.78s)]
*  Like a partier to learn? [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11582.82s)]
*  To learn. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11584.74s)]
*  So this was a long time ago. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11585.66s)]
*  I was about three or four years into doing Tai Chi Chuan. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11589.18s)]
*  I was doing it religiously. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11592.46s)]
*  Both sides of the world, I was doing it hours every day. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11593.42s)]
*  I was going to the dojo three or four times. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11595.38s)]
*  I was getting all the, you know, [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11597.259999999998s)]
*  where you're hot like lava and cold like ice [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11598.5s)]
*  and all those woo experiences and everything. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11600.46s)]
*  And then something happened that sort of twigged me. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11606.699999999999s)]
*  So some people came to me, I was in graduate school [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11612.5s)]
*  and they said, you've changed. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11615.82s)]
*  What's different about you? [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11617.779999999999s)]
*  You're much more balanced and flexible. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11619.58s)]
*  And I realized, oh, the Tai Chi is changing me. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11621.099999999999s)]
*  I'm so concentrated on all the wonderful, bizarre experience [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11624.42s)]
*  and I'm not paying attention to how my character, [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11627.82s)]
*  my cognition, like how I'm showing up, [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11630.82s)]
*  how I'm comporting myself. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11633.54s)]
*  That was being changed. [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11635.7s)]
*  Other people were noticing that. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11636.58s)]
*  And that's been something I've been looking for, [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11638.38s)]
*  I keep looking for. [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11641.42s)]
*  When somebody recommends a practice, [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11642.86s)]
*  does it transfer broadly, deeply and effectively [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11645.02s)]
*  into their many domains of their life? [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11648.06s)]
*  Does it percolate between different layers of their psyche? [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11650.22s)]
*  And so it's like, oh, oh, oh. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11654.140000000001s)]
*  And so, and I had a very good friend [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11656.5s)]
*  and I won't out that person, of course, [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11659.460000000001s)]
*  because of course these things are still technically illegal. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11661.86s)]
*  But that's gonna change soon too. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11664.7s)]
*  And they offered to do magic mushrooms. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11667.94s)]
*  And I said to myself, [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11672.94s)]
*  and this is explicitly how I framed it. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11674.58s)]
*  And I said, I wanna go on magic mushrooms [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11676.66s)]
*  and I wanna do Tai Chi Chuan. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11680.220000000001s)]
*  On, when I'm high, [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11682.78s)]
*  cause I wanna know what it's like, [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11686.220000000001s)]
*  what it feels like, what the phenomenology is like. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11688.54s)]
*  Cause the psychedelics reduce your egocentrism, right? [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11692.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11695.7s)]
*  And they open up that connectedness, [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11696.54s)]
*  you're falling in love with reality. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11698.380000000001s)]
*  I wanna know what it's like to do Tai Chi like that. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11699.74s)]
*  Because if I do, what I can do is I can remember it. [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11703.58s)]
*  And I can use that like a touchstone. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11708.18s)]
*  And so what I can do is, [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11710.740000000002s)]
*  I can practice and I'll have this deep felt memory [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11713.5s)]
*  of what it was like. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11716.86s)]
*  And I can keep calibrating the practice [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11717.7s)]
*  so that I can get into that state [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11720.18s)]
*  without having to use the drug. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11721.5s)]
*  And so that's how I did it. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11723.58s)]
*  And was it helpful? [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11725.66s)]
*  Yes. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11726.5s)]
*  Yes, it worked. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11728.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, boy. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11729.54s)]
*  That worked as a strategy. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11730.380000000001s)]
*  Now that brings me to something. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11731.7s)]
*  So remember the processes that make you adaptive, [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11736.1s)]
*  make you self deceptive? [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11739.26s)]
*  Yeah, real quick. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11741.3s)]
*  So it worked as a strategy in a sense [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11742.14s)]
*  it helped you get deeper. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11742.98s)]
*  And then in subsequent experiences, [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11743.82s)]
*  you was able to still get deeper? [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11745.419999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11747.22s)]
*  Because of that. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11748.06s)]
*  I can get to that state now in Tai Chi Chuan [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11748.9s)]
*  without having to be on mushrooms. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11750.58s)]
*  Dang, boy, you saving money. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11752.5s)]
*  You know? [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11755.419999999998s)]
*  Well, and other things. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11760.06s)]
*  And other things. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11762.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I can't, I couldn't do it now [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11764.58s)]
*  if I wanted to because I have manures in my left ear. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11766.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a, they don't know what causes it, [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11771.18s)]
*  but my inner ear can, and I can't talk about it too long [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11773.26s)]
*  because it can trigger an attack. [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11775.74s)]
*  My inner ear. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11777.62s)]
*  What a freaking crazy disease. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11778.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bad disease. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11780.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11782.26s)]
*  My inner ear will suddenly fill with liquid [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11783.1s)]
*  and I'll get the worst vertigo you can possibly imagine. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11785.34s)]
*  Oh, a buddy gets that if you say his ex-wife's name around. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11788.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that I can. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11791.18s)]
*  I can fucking start running in a circle. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11793.1s)]
*  But psychedelics, right? [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11795.42s)]
*  Psychedelics, what they do is, [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11797.1s)]
*  we, and we're not, you know, and I work with, [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11800.7s)]
*  I talked to, I was, Alex Benye, [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11803.98s)]
*  he's got his new book out, The Bigger Picture, [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11806.74s)]
*  I was on when he released it. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11808.34s)]
*  I talk to people who do psychedelic work. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11810.26s)]
*  And, you know, and I read people like Robin Carr, [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11815.54s)]
*  Hart Harris and others. [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11817.26s)]
*  The idea is when you're dreaming, [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11818.94s)]
*  you're basically doing what psychedelics do. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11820.66s)]
*  So the idea is your brain is always taking [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11822.54s)]
*  a sample of information from the world [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11826.02s)]
*  and it's trying to predict, [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11827.74s)]
*  like we've talked about this, right? [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11829.74s)]
*  Now you face two problems in that. [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11831.939999999999s)]
*  One is you can call, [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11834.539999999999s)]
*  you can do what's called overfitting to the data. [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11837.26s)]
*  You can get all lucked into the patterns [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11839.38s)]
*  that are in the sample, [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11841.779999999999s)]
*  but don't actually aren't in the world. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11843.38s)]
*  Okay. [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11845.539999999999s)]
*  Right, right, does that make sense? [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11846.38s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11847.38s)]
*  That's called overfitting to the data. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11848.22s)]
*  You can also underfit to the data, [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11849.58s)]
*  which is you don't pick up on patterns [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11851.26s)]
*  that are in the sample that are also, [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11853.699999999999s)]
*  that are actually in the world. [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11855.7s)]
*  So there's two kinds of errors you can make. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11857.1s)]
*  The problem you face is that they're [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11859.66s)]
*  in a trade-off relationship. [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11861.060000000001s)]
*  As you try to solve one, you make the other worse. [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11862.220000000001s)]
*  And so you're constantly caught between them. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11864.62s)]
*  And so what you do, machine learning, [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11866.62s)]
*  like deep learning, these machines that are AI and stuff. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11869.34s)]
*  Yeah, oh yes. [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11873.140000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah, yeah. [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11873.980000000001s)]
*  So they face this problem. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11874.820000000002s)]
*  And what they periodically do is [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11876.900000000001s)]
*  they will throw noise into the system. [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11878.980000000001s)]
*  They will shut off half the nodes [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11881.460000000001s)]
*  or they'll put in static information. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11882.94s)]
*  And what that does is it prevents the system [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11884.980000000001s)]
*  from overfitting to the data. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11888.220000000001s)]
*  It breaks up the frame enough so that the machine [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11889.62s)]
*  will go to a wider framing, [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11892.66s)]
*  like we were talking about earlier. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11894.02s)]
*  And it looks like that's what you're doing in dreaming. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11895.54s)]
*  That's what psychedelics do. [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11898.82s)]
*  So psychedelics basically get parts of the brain [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11901.140000000001s)]
*  that normally don't talk to each other [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11904.54s)]
*  to talk to each other. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11906.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, right? [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11907.460000000001s)]
*  Like the in-laws dinner or whatever. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11908.380000000001s)]
*  Something like that, yeah. [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11910.26s)]
*  And so the thing is they have to be put in the right context [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11911.3s)]
*  because when you're sort of unmooring [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11916.82s)]
*  your salience landscape, right? [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11919.46s)]
*  That could possibly lead to insight [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11922.22s)]
*  or you could also rabbit hole [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11925.019999999999s)]
*  and get into your own personal bullshit [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11926.58s)]
*  really powerfully. [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11928.22s)]
*  So back in the 60s, people talked about set and setting. [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11929.98s)]
*  That's still true. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11933.179999999998s)]
*  You gotta have set and setting. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11934.019999999999s)]
*  But you also have to have, [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11935.58s)]
*  two more S's. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11939.82s)]
*  One of the words is multi-selec. [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11940.82s)]
*  It's sapiential. [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11942.06s)]
*  That means having to do with wisdom. [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11942.9s)]
*  You need to set, if you're gonna do psychedelics, [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11944.82s)]
*  you need to make sure you're doing lots of other practices [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11947.94s)]
*  that challenge your proclivity, [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11951.42s)]
*  your proneness to self-deception. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11953.619999999999s)]
*  That's what I mean by a sapiential context. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11955.74s)]
*  And then like how indigenous people, [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11957.78s)]
*  it's neat in which they do that. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11959.98s)]
*  They have the shamans usually, right? [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11961.619999999999s)]
*  And you also have to have it in a sacred context, right? [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11964.539999999999s)]
*  Where there's a context in which [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11967.78s)]
*  your altered states of consciousness [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11969.820000000002s)]
*  are not just running around free. [[03:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11972.1s)]
*  They have a worldview that can properly home them [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11974.66s)]
*  and integrate them in. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11977.66s)]
*  Yeah, I went to, I did an Ayahuasca ceremony. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11978.66s)]
*  Right, right. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11980.78s)]
*  Man, I didn't, it helped me so much. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11981.78s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11986.1s)]
*  Yes, it can. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11987.5s)]
*  And I'd been sober for a few years [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11988.54s)]
*  and I'd done a ton of therapy. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11990.78s)]
*  But I'd never been able to put, [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11994.380000000001s)]
*  I couldn't adjust my perspective. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11997.140000000001s)]
*  I couldn't adjust the framework [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=11999.5s)]
*  that I was looking at this thing. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12000.86s)]
*  And when it helped me to the immense, [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12002.82s)]
*  it did, I feel like it literally did [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12006.54s)]
*  a thousand sessions of therapy in two days. [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12009.62s)]
*  That's what the research shows. [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12012.5s)]
*  The research shows that. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12013.5s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12014.9s)]
*  If put in the right context. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12015.78s)]
*  And that's where we were in. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12017.58s)]
*  I mean, we were in a place, they had a shaman, [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12018.58s)]
*  they had all these little light, like candles [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12021.26s)]
*  and all these. [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12024.1s)]
*  And there was a lot of music [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12024.94s)]
*  that really put you in a special space. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12026.660000000002s)]
*  Everybody was wearing white gowns and robes were in there. [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12029.42s)]
*  There's a lot of symbolism, yes. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12033.18s)]
*  Yes, there was a ton of symbolism. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12034.380000000001s)]
*  So there was a lot of traditional moments [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12035.660000000002s)]
*  that we went through before and throughout the experience. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12039.900000000001s)]
*  It was like a nine hour experience. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12042.58s)]
*  And also there was this time where we would get up [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12044.42s)]
*  with these maracas or chakras or whatever. [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12048.1s)]
*  Chakras. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12051.5s)]
*  And we'd have to shake these little things [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12052.58s)]
*  with the sand in them. [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12054.18s)]
*  And you'd have to shake them and do this dance ritual. [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12055.86s)]
*  Like there was a lot of rituals. [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12058.58s)]
*  Yes. [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12060.619999999999s)]
*  That made it very, made the whole experience more powerful. [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12061.46s)]
*  And more transferable. [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12064.42s)]
*  So you can integrate it, you can transfer it. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12065.38s)]
*  Bleeds to different levels of your psyche. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12067.98s)]
*  Bleeds into different domains of your life. [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12070.46s)]
*  Like I was talking about. [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12072.06s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12073.02s)]
*  The problem with that now too though is [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12073.94s)]
*  that's becoming. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12076.26s)]
*  A business. [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12077.46s)]
*  Well, it's becoming a business. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12078.3s)]
*  It's becoming commodified and ayahuasca tourism is. [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12079.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, totally. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12083.58s)]
*  Yeah, like come on down here. [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12085.94s)]
*  Have your experience that you can go back [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12086.78s)]
*  and tell your friends about. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12088.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12089.82s)]
*  That kind of thing. [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12090.66s)]
*  And there are some of the flowers, [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12091.5s)]
*  even though there's like a sexy woman on the flower, [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12092.34s)]
*  like what does this have to do with this thing? [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12093.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12094.82s)]
*  Like it just, but yeah. [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12096.5s)]
*  It's scary that that's how everything becomes. [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12097.74s)]
*  Do you think down the road we will look back at society, [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12100.42s)]
*  like thousands of years from now, [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12103.02s)]
*  and be like what a poor left turn that society took. [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12104.14s)]
*  You think we'll be back in like villages and looking back. [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12108.38s)]
*  Like what do you think the long game looks like [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12111.14s)]
*  if you have any predictions? [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12113.66s)]
*  I don't know about predictions. [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12115.5s)]
*  I know about a possibility. [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12116.78s)]
*  My good friend Jordan Hall talks about a possibility [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12118.22s)]
*  that we haven't had before. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12120.58s)]
*  So until recently, in order to get the benefits [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12123.42s)]
*  of civilization, we had to live close to each other. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12126.06s)]
*  And then that gives us all the noxious side effects. [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12128.94s)]
*  But the forced multiplication [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12131.5s)]
*  of civilization was worth it, right? [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12133.58s)]
*  But now what we can do is we can do all the civilization [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12136.82s)]
*  stuff virtually, and then we could live [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12140.66s)]
*  in small scale communities. [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12143.34s)]
*  It calls this the Sisypium Project. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12146.74s)]
*  So we could live in groups of 150 people [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12148.14s)]
*  growing our own food. [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12151.66s)]
*  We could live in this way that is psychologically, [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12152.66s)]
*  physiologically healthy, and yet we could still benefit [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12155.66s)]
*  from that massive collective agency, that collective wisdom, [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12159.619999999999s)]
*  the collective intelligence that civilization affords. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12165.38s)]
*  And now we don't have to physically live. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12168.7s)]
*  So we now have the possibility where we could turn to, [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12173.98s)]
*  we could live psychologically, physiologically, physically [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12178.82s)]
*  as we evolved to, while participating [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12183.220000000001s)]
*  in a hyper-technological civilization [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12186.5s)]
*  with all of the force multiplication that that gives you. [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12190.26s)]
*  And this is a real possibility. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12193.02s)]
*  And he's done stuff to try and make it happen, [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12194.86s)]
*  but it's like the lone voice crying [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12198.380000000001s)]
*  in the wilderness kind of thing, until he isn't. [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12202.1s)]
*  Until he isn't. [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12204.460000000001s)]
*  And I hope he keeps coming back to it. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12205.380000000001s)]
*  That's a real possibility. [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12208.66s)]
*  We could take that turn. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12210.02s)]
*  For me, if we could take that turn while building up [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12212.1s)]
*  these kinds of colleges of practices, [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12216.94s)]
*  both individually and collectively, I'm talking about. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12218.7s)]
*  And he and I have talked about how those would integrate [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12222.02s)]
*  and support each other. [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12224.26s)]
*  That could be a turn away from some of the darkness [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12226.019999999999s)]
*  that many of us feel we're entering into. [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12232.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12235.46s)]
*  Cool, man. [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12237.3s)]
*  I don't think I have anything else to think about. [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12238.14s)]
*  I mean, I could probably think about more, [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12240.3s)]
*  but I don't know if I could do it. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12241.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12243.259999999998s)]
*  So I mean, it's a lot to think. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12244.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12245.98s)]
*  Whenever you get burned out from thinking, [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12246.859999999999s)]
*  what do you like to do? [[03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12248.259999999998s)]
*  When I get burned out from thinking, [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12250.859999999999s)]
*  I like to do embodied stuff like Tai Chi Chuan or meditate. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12253.3s)]
*  Sometimes I like to read some very good literature [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12259.9s)]
*  where I'm putting myself sort of into somebody else's [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12263.46s)]
*  thinking. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12267.34s)]
*  Do you read fiction ever? [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12268.18s)]
*  Yeah, I'm reading The Last of the Wine, [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12269.46s)]
*  which is a really wonderful historical fiction [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12272.859999999999s)]
*  about Athens and the Peloponnesian War. [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12275.779999999999s)]
*  And we're following these two characters [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12278.06s)]
*  as they form a profound platonic relationship. [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12279.54s)]
*  But platonic actually means also sexual at that time. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12283.460000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12286.7s)]
*  But they're encountering, [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12287.54s)]
*  Socrates is there. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12294.820000000002s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12295.86s)]
*  And so for me, it's like I get to meet Socrates [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12296.7s)]
*  and hang around with him. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12298.7s)]
*  Plato, I was read to a chapter and I sort of stopped [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12300.02s)]
*  and I savored the moment and I read it again. [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12303.54s)]
*  And they go to the gymnasium [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12306.1s)]
*  and Aristocles is there and he's a wrestler. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12309.82s)]
*  And that's actually Plato's real name, [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12312.5s)]
*  he's Aristocles. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12314.54s)]
*  Plato means broad shoulders because he was a wrestler, [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12315.94s)]
*  that was his nickname. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12318.34s)]
*  And I said to myself, I just met Plato. [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12319.62s)]
*  That's cool. [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12321.82s)]
*  Dude, the Delphi, that was like your WWF, huh? [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12323.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12326.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was, I used to be a big fan of science fiction [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12327.82s)]
*  and occasionally there's some good science fiction. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12334.54s)]
*  But now, maybe it's just because I'm older, [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12337.02s)]
*  I'm finding really good historical fiction to be, [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12340.939999999999s)]
*  a friend of mine, one of my most important friends, [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12345.02s)]
*  Christopher Mastropiatio, my co-author on so much work, [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12349.46s)]
*  he works for the Revecke Foundation. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12353.14s)]
*  He's also recommended, what is it? [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12355.859999999999s)]
*  Hadrian's Memoirs, I believe it's called, I got that book. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12359.46s)]
*  It's about Hadrian writing to the young Marcus Aurelius, [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12362.58s)]
*  trying to educate him in how to be a great stoic emperor. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12365.26s)]
*  And so, I find that kind of literature, [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12370.98s)]
*  when it's not hackneyed, when it's really well researched [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12373.34s)]
*  and well written, I find that very inspiring. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12375.98s)]
*  It helps me to aspire to be the kind of person I wanna be. [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12379.34s)]
*  And I find that, I find, because it's inspiring [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12384.26s)]
*  and it's beautiful, I find it very healing and restorative. [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12389.22s)]
*  I was just reading this book, [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12396.18s)]
*  I think it's called The Library, [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12399.02s)]
*  you look it up, this guy, Matt Haig, H-A-I-G. [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12400.34s)]
*  And it's about this lady, [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12403.42s)]
*  she thinks her life is horrible, right? [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12405.58s)]
*  So she wants to take her own life. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12407.98s)]
*  But the second she does, she wakes up in a library [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12410.34s)]
*  and every book on the shelf is, [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12414.1s)]
*  The Midnight Library, that's what it's called. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12417.82s)]
*  And every book on the shelf is a different possibility [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12419.66s)]
*  of her life if she had made different choices. [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12422.300000000001s)]
*  And there's a billion books, it's an endless library. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12424.5s)]
*  So she can take one and open it and she'll be in that life. [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12426.9s)]
*  And it's really interesting, [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12430.98s)]
*  because the author just kind of takes you on the journey [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12431.859999999999s)]
*  where every life you think, [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12435.5s)]
*  oh, if I had just stayed and done this thing, [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12438.38s)]
*  but there's a million other things [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12440.3s)]
*  that are different about that life. [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12441.66s)]
*  That you didn't realize, oh, when I get to this life, [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12443.58s)]
*  my father had passed away early or my partner had left me [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12446.019999999999s)]
*  or I was cheating on something. [[03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12450.779999999999s)]
*  It's just pretty fascinating to see all the different, [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12453.22s)]
*  like the broader view, instead of just being [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12455.34s)]
*  very specific, like, oh, if this one thing changes, [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12458.06s)]
*  I would be awesome, but if that one thing changed, [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12460.98s)]
*  so many things would change. [[03:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12463.66s)]
*  That's excellent, I think I would like to read that book. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12465.14s)]
*  It's really cool, it's easy to read, [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12467.78s)]
*  it blew my mind just what a creative idea it was. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12468.86s)]
*  It's a really good idea. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12471.66s)]
*  That's what good literature can do, right? [[03:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12472.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12473.86s)]
*  It can persuade you without making an argument, [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12475.06s)]
*  but nevertheless, it rationally persuades you [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12478.1s)]
*  to really consider and reflect on things. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12480.62s)]
*  Yeah, it kind of made me excited. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12482.78s)]
*  It was like I hadn't read something [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12483.980000000001s)]
*  that had kind of a new idea or something [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12485.220000000001s)]
*  that I had never thought I ever heard seen before. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12487.02s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is exciting. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12489.820000000002s)]
*  It felt promising. [[03:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12491.34s)]
*  New ideas that have both truth and relevance. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12492.54s)]
*  See, like you said, they're so nourishing. [[03:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12495.5s)]
*  They feed your mind in a way that information doesn't. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12498.02s)]
*  We're at a place now where everyone has access [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12504.300000000001s)]
*  to the same information. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12506.34s)]
*  So the value of information itself has kind of diminished [[03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12507.7s)]
*  unless you can iterate that information [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12513.140000000001s)]
*  or share that information to people concisely [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12515.820000000002s)]
*  and effectively and in ways that they can digest it. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12520.140000000001s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons why people are going [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12523.980000000001s)]
*  to a lot of orders and speakers and stoics [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12527.300000000001s)]
*  and different, I don't know what they'd be called, [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12530.42s)]
*  but evangelists maybe, but non-Christian, [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12535.94s)]
*  non-religious evangelists, because they need, [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12539.06s)]
*  I don't know what I'm saying. [[03:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12545.38s)]
*  I know, I think what you're saying is people have a sense [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12546.9s)]
*  of something that will open them up [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12553.02s)]
*  in that way you were talking about. [[03:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12557.02s)]
*  And they see that possibility and they're hungry for it. [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12558.66s)]
*  Yeah, they're hungry for it. [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12561.62s)]
*  And some of the old mediums of it, [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12562.460000000001s)]
*  have proven to be non-valuable recently. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12564.02s)]
*  And so I think they're looking for new mediums of it. [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12567.34s)]
*  So yeah, TSL, it said, [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12569.82s)]
*  where's all the wisdom we've lost in knowledge? [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12571.140000000001s)]
*  Where's all the knowledge we've lost in the information? [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12573.34s)]
*  And so yeah, it's like that very much. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12576.18s)]
*  And good literature can take you back. [[03:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12578.58s)]
*  It can take you from the information into the knowledge [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12582.58s)]
*  and if it's really great literature, [[03:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12584.86s)]
*  from the knowledge back into the wisdom. [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12585.98s)]
*  John Vervecky, thanks so much, man. [[03:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12588.300000000001s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12591.140000000001s)]
*  I really enjoyed this. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12591.98s)]
*  I mean, you drew a lot out for me [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12593.619999999999s)]
*  and it was really wonderful. [[03:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12598.619999999999s)]
*  You shared a lot, which was really wonderful. [[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12600.9s)]
*  And I feel like one of my criteria of genuine dialogos [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12603.18s)]
*  is we both got to a place we couldn't have got to [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12606.5s)]
*  on our own. [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12609.26s)]
*  It wasn't just a dialogue. [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12610.1s)]
*  We like, there was something, [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12610.939999999999s)]
*  a life took shape between us and grew for a while [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12612.5s)]
*  and we sort of followed it. [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12615.859999999999s)]
*  I really, the aesthetics and the way that we were [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12616.9s)]
*  the aesthetics and the meaning of that, [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12620.86s)]
*  I find that very, very powerful. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12624.34s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12626.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think I was afraid, [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12627.26s)]
*  sometimes I get afraid to talk to people [[03:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12628.34s)]
*  that have a lot of education [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12629.699999999999s)]
*  and are good at sharing information. [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12632.14s)]
*  So I feel, I guess pretty happy about myself [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12634.58s)]
*  that I planned ahead and so I had somewhat of a plan. [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12638.34s)]
*  So that was nice, but I didn't feel like I had to like [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12642.18s)]
*  stick to it too much. [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12645.1s)]
*  And I felt like I was able to like, [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12646.86s)]
*  communicate and learn. [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12649.3s)]
*  And ask questions that I think myself and my listeners [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12651.74s)]
*  are curious about, you know, [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12654.060000000001s)]
*  and be just like a voice for our little group of listeners. [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12655.54s)]
*  So yeah, man, thanks so much, dude. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12660.1s)]
*  And yeah, I gotta come check you out. [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12662.060000000001s)]
*  I wanna come see a class or something [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12664.62s)]
*  when I get up there to Toronto. [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12667.060000000001s)]
*  You're welcome, let me know. [[03:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12668.5s)]
*  Yeah, can people come sit in there [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12669.7s)]
*  like they ride along with a cop? [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12670.94s)]
*  You can audit it because the universities [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12672.380000000001s)]
*  are publicly funded in Canada. [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12676.86s)]
*  You can audit any course you want [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12679.140000000001s)]
*  as long as you get permission of the instructor [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12681.02s)]
*  and it doesn't violate the fire code. [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12682.78s)]
*  Sometimes I'm in a room and it's seating for 35 [[03:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12684.86s)]
*  and there's 35 people. [[03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12688.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, oh, and I won't wear nothing flammable either. [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12689.94s)]
*  I won't wear, you think I'm gonna wear wool or something? [[03:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12693.18s)]
*  I probably won't, so, but thank you for letting me know. [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12695.74s)]
*  John Verbeke, thank you so much for your time. [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12698.02s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12699.98s)]
*  Now I'm just floating on the breeze [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12701.82s)]
*  And I feel I'm falling like these leaves I must be [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12704.34s)]
*  on a stone. [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12709.140000000001s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground [[03:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12710.98s)]
*  I'll share this piece of mind I found [[03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12715.220000000001s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12717.98s)]
*  But it's gonna take [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxE2c_PNgR0&t=12722.66s)]
