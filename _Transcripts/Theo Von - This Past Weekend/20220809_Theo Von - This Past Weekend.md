*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Do you feel, when you go in there, do you feel like, um, was it scary to start to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=156.04s)]
*  think, okay, I'm going to build like an actual building for comedy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's like a whole new business kind of, isn't it? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=163.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  It's kind of overwhelming. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=166.92s)]
*  It's a little overwhelming. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=168.32s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=169.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  Did, um, all right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=171.12s)]
*  It's exciting, but it's part of me is like, what the fuck? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=175.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=178.76s)]
*  Cause I was listening to you show it to me and I was like, damn Joe, it felt like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  you were like a, um, con like a contractor, like a, you know, like, um, like a landlord [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=181.32s)]
*  kind of, it was like, oh, this is a whole, it feels like a whole different uniform. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=187.6s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=190.68s)]
*  It's a totally different thing, but luckily I got people running it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=191.08s)]
*  So my participation in that aspect of it will hopefully be minimal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, but it is a, it's definitely, you know, but I felt like I felt compelled. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=200.16s)]
*  I felt compelled to do it, you know, because I always felt like if you, you know, I never [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=207.16s)]
*  wanted to own a comedy club, but I always felt like you just have to be nice to comedy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  club owners cause you never want to be one of those fucking people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=217.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  But then when I knew I was moving here and cap city was already closed, I was like, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  maybe I should buy a fucking club and start a club. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  And so that became my focus. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=227.76s)]
*  It became this thing where I was thinking, I really should do that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=229.8s)]
*  I really should like set it up so that I'm setting up the right way. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=232.88s)]
*  So I'm not setting up to try to make money. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=236.64s)]
*  I'm just setting up to make an amazing environment for comedy and have a home for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=238.48s)]
*  comedians where they just feel good. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=242.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  They can go there and that's a great spot to hang out and you just feel good about [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=244.24s)]
*  the atmosphere. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=248.36s)]
*  You'll be able to perform well, you'd be treated well, like everyone would be, you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=250.04s)]
*  know, treated with respect and with fun and just a good attitude. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=253.72s)]
*  Has the city been receptive to it? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=260.88s)]
*  Has there been like any like kickback like that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=262.48s)]
*  Has there been any like barriers to create in a comedy club that you didn't expect [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=264.36s)]
*  just because you'd never done it before? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=269.32s)]
*  It's a, it's a process. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=270.8s)]
*  I mean, it took a long time to get the permits and all that stuff, but it wasn't, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=272.52s)]
*  you know, it's just normal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=275.44s)]
*  It's normal for any business. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=277.0s)]
*  And especially if you're going to get a liquor license and all that jazz and you're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=278.44s)]
*  going to have live performance. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=282.6s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I heard you and that guy, they were talking about, y'all were talking [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  about horse sex and the, when I pulled up in the lobby, like, oh, okay, this is my [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=288.24s)]
*  kind of place today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Dude, I saw in New Orleans one time they had a lot of the cops in the French [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=295.24s)]
*  quarter on horseback and two of the horses started fucking with the cops on them, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=298.8s)]
*  bro. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=304.44s)]
*  The cops getting mad? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=306.72s)]
*  One of them was. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  Was the other one excited? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=309.88s)]
*  The one in the back, I think was kind of fucking vibing with it a little. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=310.96s)]
*  Cause at least he was in the winning position, you know? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=314.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=316.2s)]
*  You don't want to be the guy where the horse gets done fucking that horse and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=316.56s)]
*  then he starts fucking you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=319.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=321.4s)]
*  Or the horse collapses and you get trapped under it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  I saw a horrible video the other day of these dudes were racing horses, they're [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=324.76s)]
*  running and a dog, a yappy dog runs out onto the track and the horse trips over [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=328.76s)]
*  the dog and the guy dies. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=335.2s)]
*  What was the dog running out there to tell him something or something? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  Or like to greet him? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=340.52s)]
*  Or to bark. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=341.24s)]
*  Oh, just some shitty dog that thought it'd be a good idea to bark at a fucking [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=342.24s)]
*  horse and the horse trips and the horse is in full throttle and the horse trips [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=345.48s)]
*  over this dog and the, you know, lands on this guy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=350.6s)]
*  The guy goes, you know, the horse goes head first and the guy goes with him. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=354.4s)]
*  So the guy goes down, the horse comes on top of him and crushes him. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  And the guy died? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=361.4s)]
*  You want to see it? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=362.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=364.92s)]
*  I'll find it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=366.76s)]
*  I'll see it, man. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=367.48s)]
*  I didn't want to at first. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=368.36s)]
*  But now you're thinking about it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  But now I'm in. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=371.24s)]
*  Dude, they had a fundraiser one time when I was going to LSU, they had a fundraiser [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=372.0s)]
*  there for a guy who had gotten hurt playing football, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=375.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=379.4s)]
*  So they raise all this money. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=380.24s)]
*  They wanted to get him a nice fancy wheelchair, one that has like, you know, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=381.56s)]
*  like everything on it, like the centrifuge or whatever you can have on a wheelchair. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=385.32s)]

*  I had aardvark at a wedding one time. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  Aardvark? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=510.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=511.24s)]
*  What kind of wedding was that? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=512.24s)]
*  It was, I think it was just like a white wedding or something. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=513.24s)]
*  Like they said it was aardvark. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=516.6s)]
*  It could have been something else though, or they could have misspelled it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=518.64s)]
*  Like a Billy Idol type white wedding? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=521.72s)]
*  No, it was just like a regular like, two whites getting married, you know? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=522.72s)]
*  They ate aardvark? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=526.68s)]
*  They said they did. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=528.04s)]
*  What state was this? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=529.04s)]
*  This was in Louisiana when I was growing up. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=530.04s)]
*  It was a fancy French place and they said that they had aardvark over there, so we believed [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=531.04s)]
*  them. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=535.62s)]
*  Yeah, I just thought it was crazy that so the head so [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=537.56s)]
*  Like it was like the night after we did the interview same day, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  so the the the head article is Joe Rogan reads the tick-tock agreement rights like it's almost like [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=544.28s)]
*  Someone's like is Joe the only person who's reading the terms of service of things in America and the rest of us are just [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=551.92s)]
*  Using shit like right out of the box like not even paying attention to what's going on [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=557.04s)]
*  That's what I felt like a little bit [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=561.68s)]
*  I think a lot of people are now with with things like tick-tock because there's been a lot of articles written about it and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=562.94s)]
*  A lot of people calling for it to be banned [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=569.5s)]
*  Because it's basically Chinese spyware [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=572.94s)]
*  That's but if they get us then what would they like so say we talked about it a little bit the other day [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=575.34s)]
*  But say they get like they infiltrate all the electronics they get all the data and everything [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=579.24s)]
*  But then how do they get us as people like how do they get us into the cages? Well, I? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=583.3000000000001s)]
*  Don't think it's as simple as get people in the cages [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=588.7s)]
*  I think what they want is intellectual property [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=590.9s)]
*  They want to steal data and they want it like if they have access to your computer and right what if you're working on? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=593.42s)]
*  Some fucking weapon system, or what if you're working on? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=599.02s)]
*  Something some communication system, and they have access to your computer they can steal that data [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  From your computer because they have access to it because you're using tick-tock so it's just about information [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=609.22s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=613.86s)]
*  The one of the more disturbing things is saying that they have access to computers that aren't even being used for tick-tock [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=614.18s)]
*  Right like other computers are saying that which is just that's crazy [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=621.9s)]
*  It's so insane that that would actually be something that someone would allow they had an engineer [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=625.5799999999999s)]
*  software engineer back engineered tick-tock and said it was the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  most [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=636.34s)]
*  In terms of like invasion of privacy it was the most egregious example that they had ever found [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=637.5799999999999s)]
*  So wouldn't do wouldn't there be some? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=643.18s)]
*  Some comp some [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=646.38s)]
*  structure or [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=648.62s)]
*  Template in American society or government or hierarchy that would protect us from that sort of thing why that's what I don't understand sometimes [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  Why isn't there like a something that protects us from that sort of thing or is it just our own responsibilities? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=657.06s)]
*  I don't know what they can do now other than ban it [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=662.36s)]
*  But I know they were talking about banning banning it for a while [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=666.7s)]
*  But then there was some sort of a deal that was made where the data was going to go from the American version of tick-tock [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=669.58s)]
*  Was gonna go to America, but it turns out that it's not it's going straight to China [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=675.7s)]
*  And then they get the version to America see if that's correct see that sounds rather [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and we're gonna keep using it. It's almost like because what like what if they hit today told women [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=686.46s)]
*  There's a makeup that would steal your face, right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  Like [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=693.54s)]
*  You write it on and it's gonna put your face in China yeah, and then we still use it right I [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=695.8199999999999s)]
*  Mean that just shows me the level of addiction that we have to social media. Yeah, yeah [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=702.66s)]
*  I mean, it's a it's an addiction. They have an office here tick-tock has an office in Austin for people that need help [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=707.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know I found about that some lady was heckling the creek in the cave, and she said what do you do? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=712.14s)]
*  She's like I work for tick-tock [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=716.38s)]
*  Hey [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=718.58s)]
*  How old was she she's there 20s. Oh, that's all right dude Tony ripped into that lady the other [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=721.46s)]
*  Lady was not over a table very sad there was some fucking drunks last night [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=727.66s)]
*  I'm some rowdy ass people for a Tuesday. Yeah, you crushed man. It was fun. It was cool [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=733.26s)]
*  I hadn't seen you perform in a long. I mean I hadn't seen a lot of people were formed a long time [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=738.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's uh here goes leaked audio from 80 internal tick-tock meetings show that user data [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=741.86s)]
*  US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=747.9000000000001s)]
*  I feel like with these tools are some backdoor to access user data in almost all of them said an internal auditor [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=751.7s)]
*  Hired to help tick-tock close off Chinese access to sensitive information like Americans birthdays and phone numbers [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=758.5400000000001s)]
*  Damn, and if you look at the terms of service. It's a lot more than that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=765.12s)]
*  Yeah, what they have the ability to access is a lot more than that that turn the terms of service is nuts [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=768.5s)]
*  Just reading that any company that would try to sell you on social media [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=774.7s)]
*  I mean it's one thing to like say oh, we're gonna target ads in your direction [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=778.66s)]
*  We're kind of used to that right whatever like with Google and she'll I don't mind if they send ads my way [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=782.74s)]
*  But that what they're doing is nuts. They have access to your audio. That means they have access to your fucking microphone [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=787.58s)]
*  They're listening to you talk. That's scary [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=794.86s)]

*  That'd be a good move [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1592.8s)]
*  If you had a big boat if you had a boat with food on it [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1593.76s)]

*  No, but it is it is like like that's one of the things that Stephen King said really affected him [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1735.4399999999998s)]
*  In his writing when he quit smoking mm-hmm [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1741.62s)]
*  So I got a question for you, so a couple [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1747.74s)]
*  whenever you're like [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1751.1399999999999s)]
*  Comics always knew that you were doing well right like but whenever you got like whenever you got your Spotify deal [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1753.98s)]
*  Was it scary that Pete because they attached like such big figures to it in the press right? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1761.3s)]
*  Was that scary that people knew that you were wealthy would did that but did that was that scary at all um [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1766.42s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's scary, but it's just one of those things where people like start debating whether or not you should have that money [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1774.14s)]
*  Why don't they give that money to other people? Why don't you fix the streets and the schools and what was he? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1780.7s)]
*  And then there's some people that just get jealous still get angry you know and there's a lot of angry jealous comedians [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1789.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, and there's a lot of comedians that look at other people's success, and they feel bad [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1796.1s)]
*  So they think that you're doing something bad because they feel bad because they don't like the way it makes them feel when someone's killing [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1800.54s)]
*  It like a lot of comedians are narcissists and a lot of them are very self-centered and egomaniacs [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1806.58s)]
*  Yeah, and so they think that when you're doing something well or something's going well for you [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1811.82s)]
*  That's somehow another take something away from them mmM. You know why does that happen do you think? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1816.58s)]
*  Famine thinking people think like there's not enough for everybody with comedy there clearly is enough for everybody with podcasts [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1822.46s)]
*  There's clearly enough for everybody and when when other people are doing well [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1829.54s)]
*  It's actually better for everybody because it like gets more people interested in podcasts more people getting interested in comedy [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1832.98s)]
*  That's what my take on it, but I'm [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1840.86s)]
*  That's my I've always had that take I've always like try to help other comedians. Oh, yeah [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1844.42s)]
*  I think yeah, I think I try and remember you I think inspire a lot of people to try and think that way more [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1849.58s)]
*  You know I heard you talking about that on Andrew Schultz's show, and I think you inspire a lot of people to try and think like [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1855.3s)]

*  It's good for your act like when other people are killing it. It's good for you [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1870.82s)]
*  You just can't you can't have that that miserly way of thinking that some people have they want it all for themselves you can't [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1874.9s)]
*  That's not good. Well some of it's a fee. It's a I think especially for some people if they never came from anything [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1882.54s)]
*  It's a very it can be scary. You know yeah, yeah, it can be scary [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=1887.8200000000002s)]

*  They'd call it cousin lip if people had it two to three percent chance their child is born with a birth defect [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3357.6200000000003s)]

*  Well, that's a one of the concerns about that place North Sentinel Island that [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3387.7799999999997s)]
*  That island of uncontacted people there's only 39 of them. Yeah, yeah, are you talking about that? Oh about the Bible guy? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3392.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's uh, that place is there's only 39 of them. They have to be related. What's kind of [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3399.62s)]
*  Interesting about looking for this Google doesn't really want to show me what I'm looking for [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3407.34s)]
*  It's only bringing up animal inbreeding see that's crazy. Wow [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3412.9s)]

*  Oh you fucking pop-up ads a curious adult from Texas asks [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3435.08s)]
*  The future the future crime people have caught us incest laws seem to be socially rather than genetically based [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3443.36s)]
*  But I'm guessing there are biological consequences too [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3449.96s)]
*  So what are the exact genetic risks of two siblings having a child together? Let's get down to it. Okay, you're probably right [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3452.7599999999998s)]
*  I [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3459.36s)]
*  Two siblings of kids together have a higher risk of passing on a recessive disease to their kids [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3462.08s)]
*  Okay, what are they? What is the number though? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3468.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay, here it goes [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3473.6800000000003s)]
*  I have a brother and sister of both carriers or have a child together each of their children [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3474.96s)]
*  Would have a one in four chance of ending up with Oh CF is that cystic fibrosis? Yeah [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3479.4s)]
*  By getting a disease copy of [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3487.06s)]
*  CFTR from each parent so the odds of this brother and sister having a child with the disease is [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3490.9s)]
*  One out of four or one in sixteen [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3496.3s)]
*  Now hmm, I must say don't risk it [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3499.66s)]
*  Yeah, don't risk it dude. We used to they used to say boss if if you rearrange the letters a sister, what does it spell? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3502.82s)]
*  resist [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3510.7s)]
*  And I never forgot that's good that's smart yeah, I thought it was helpful [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3513.7s)]
*  Yes, so I had a question like so, you know like how golf like the PGA started doing like the live [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3518.54s)]
*  You know, like they have people leaving the PGA [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3524.5s)]
*  Because this big money organization came in and is paying the hot the best golfers [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3527.66s)]
*  Could something like that ever happen to the UFC? Do you feel like? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3533.14s)]
*  That's an interesting question [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3537.06s)]
*  They've tried to do that before [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3539.2999999999997s)]
*  Affliction came along before and they got fador and they got Tim Sylvia and [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3541.94s)]
*  Andre a lot of ski there was a lot of like big-name fighters and went over to affliction fought for them [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3547.1000000000004s)]
*  But they went under after a few events. It's hard doing something like the UFC [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3551.82s)]
*  First of all, the UFC is so firmly established. It would be like trying to create a new NBA [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3557.46s)]
*  It's like maybe you could do it, but you need a lot of money [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3562.42s)]
*  Fortunately for this live golf thing is it's run by the Saudis and they obviously have insane amounts of money [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3566.86s)]
*  But even so people have passed on it because they don't want to be associated with the Saudis [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3573.62s)]
*  But do you think like if they start to see that template work and we don't really know if it's gonna work yet [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3578.82s)]
*  I mean, they're just you know, this it's just started [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3583.5s)]
*  It really depends on how much money they throw at them and how long they continue to do it for they have [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3585.7s)]
*  So much money. They have so much money. They can't even imagine it [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3591.34s)]
*  I don't think we can imagine Wow because you're talking about trillions of dollars. You're talking about oil money [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3595.14s)]
*  I think they could just keep that ball rolling if they decide to do that [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3600.3799999999997s)]
*  They may be able to have like a real rival, but right now it's this is the first year. Is that correct? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3605.98s)]
*  Jamie you're there on the first year second event has been completed third. There's gonna be eight events [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3612.08s)]
*  They got I guess that'd be six more left [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3617.68s)]
*  And what does the vibe feel like out there as a as somebody who pays attention to golf and stuff? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3619.58s)]
*  Does it feel like it's it's they don't have a TV deal. So it's all being broadcast differently [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3623.86s)]
*  I would guess that this is a play to get a TV deal [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3629.3s)]
*  There are still people they just got a big announcer that went over from it. I think NBC [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3633.26s)]
*  He's been a long time 25 year plus guy. Who's that? His name is David Faraday [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3638.58s)]
*  He's got a really like well-known voice for the for golf golf [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3642.6s)]
*  Yeah [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3645.6200000000003s)]
*  Now is there a stigma attached to this these guys getting like yeah there is outcast for sure [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3645.94s)]
*  But they don't seem to mind that much because the money so great because the money is really great [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3651.4s)]
*  And they don't have to play golf every week like they had to oh so with the PGA [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3655.92s)]
*  Yeah, right and like who's the one guy was Phil Mickelson's that his name biggest one getting [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3660.04s)]
*  Roasted for it, I guess and apparently he's not playing good [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3666.12s)]
*  that's the that's the other interesting thing is [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3669.36s)]
*  They're already they're getting prepaid money, so they don't it's not performance-based [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3672.7200000000003s)]
*  There is performance-based money that can come if they win there's more money to win in a tournament [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3676.36s)]
*  But so there's less incentive you think they're getting they have like I read a four and a half year contract right now [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3680.44s)]
*  Is what most these guys have? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3685.64s)]
*  Varying levels of money six figures for some of them only six figures. I'm sorry [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3687.7200000000003s)]
*  On top of another it's okay, man. I'm nervous to a billion millions of dollars hundreds of millions for some people [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3694.52s)]
*  Yeah, so for them they feel like fuck. This is my ticket out. I could retire. Yeah. Yeah, so fuck it fuck all the stigma [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3700.04s)]
*  Yeah, an argument against it is really that they're not gonna be playing [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3708.0400000000004s)]
*  traditionally what everyone's been playing for over their careers of like [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3711.7200000000003s)]
*  The big tournaments that everybody's accustomed to but they don't have a TV deal right now, right? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3715.92s)]
*  It's just on YouTube and their website, but man YouTube is so big. Yeah, but I love for golf though [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3721.32s)]
*  I feel like a lot of people there's something about I feel like I see my stepdad watches it on TV [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3727.32s)]
*  You know, it's a Sunday after TV thing [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3732.36s)]
*  There's a tradition about that that I feel like is really baked into golf. Mmm, maybe I don't know enough about golf [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3734.84s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. But to answer your question. Yes, somebody could come along and do something like that. It's possible [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3741.1200000000003s)]
*  You'd have to throw a lot of money [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3748.04s)]
*  And you know, I mean you have to get guys that are out of their contract, right? Yeah [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3751.48s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have to get guys that are out of their contract or get guys that are on the come-up [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3755.52s)]
*  You know that like right about to break into the UFC and get them before they you know [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3760.92s)]
*  Because there's a lot of like really talented guys that are coming up. Yeah [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3766.4s)]
*  there's a company called one FC that is based out of Asia and [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3771.16s)]
*  They they put on some killer fucking shows and I watched some of their fighters and some of their fights and man [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3776.2000000000003s)]
*  These guys are world-class killers. They're really good [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3782.04s)]
*  They easily could be fighting in the UFC many of them and then many UFC guys like Mighty Mouse and [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3785.72s)]
*  Eddie Alvarez is quite a few guys have gone over there and they're they're competing now in one FC [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3791.64s)]
*  So that's that's like a viable alternative for some people don't want to compete in the UFC anymore [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3797.4s)]
*  Or maybe they have a more lucrative deal for one FC [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3803.84s)]
*  But it's not in the public zeitgeist the way UFC is like you tell people like oh I was watching one FC [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3806.7599999999998s)]

*  This is my favorite sport. I I didn't realize it but after like a certain month I was like, oh wow [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3845.92s)]
*  This is my favorite sport. Well once it started once they started doing those events [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3851.18s)]
*  When everything else was shut down it opened up a lot of people's eyes [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3855.64s)]
*  So like what could be possible and so then the NBA started doing events and all these other sports organizations started doing events with no audience [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3859.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know didn't have baseball games with no audience. Yeah, I think the Dodgers won the World Series with no audience [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3866.2s)]

*  We did a show the night before then we I was sitting behind you and so like you you guys are [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3896.72s)]
*  Commentating and then you go right up into the ring and you come right back down and you commentate again [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3902.3599999999997s)]

*  It just seemed like a lot like this is a lot, you know, like you have to have a real pace for it [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3908.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a real job. Yeah, you have to have energy for sure. It blew my mind [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3912.48s)]

*  I sit down for six hours and I try not to pee [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3918.96s)]
*  Which is lucky that I have good experience doing the podcast because I'm used to like holding my piss for three hours [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3922.04s)]
*  But that's about my limit. So I always have to pee at least once or twice [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3926.92s)]
*  Maybe you know, I like riding that bag hard though [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3931.08s)]
*  Sometimes like also I'm drinking like Monster energy drinks sometimes which are like piss magnets. Yeah [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3933.6s)]
*  Yeah, they're delicious, but they make you want to pee make you want to beat your wife, too [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=3940.1600000000003s)]

*  I switch I switch to a new idea [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4280.24s)]
*  Okay, what I was saying is do you think we all in the same skin color and in some sort of a trans? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4282.64s)]
*  Sexual type of situation. I think it's very possible that we all become genderless. Yes. I do think that's possible [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4290.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think that might be what is happening with like [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4298.56s)]
*  Microplastics are changing people's hormone systems. I don't know if you know about all that [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4302.52s)]
*  Do you know about all that? You know, I don't know [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4307.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, I appreciate it. There's a book called countdown was nice of you by a woman [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4310.68s)]
*  Her name is dr [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4315.08s)]
*  Shanna swan and she came on the podcast and she explained that there's certain chemicals that are in [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4316.16s)]
*  plastics and in some fertilizers that are disrupting the [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4322.08s)]
*  human body endocrine system and [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4326.72s)]
*  It's causing people's penises to shrink balls to shrink [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4329.6s)]
*  Sperm counts are lowering and one of the ways they find out about this is the size of people's taints. Oh wow [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4334.24s)]
*  Yes in male mammals. The taint is 50 to 100 percent larger than female mammals [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4341.0s)]
*  So like when they pick up a gerbil, that's how they can quickly tell whether or not [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4346.9s)]
*  It's a boy or girl is by the size of the taint and when the introduction of phthalates it starts with a P [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4349.72s)]
*  Pth a la te s I think it's how you spell it [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4356.46s)]
*  mm-hmm, you say phthalates and phthalates are a type of chemical that disrupts the human body and [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4360.3s)]
*  because of the [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4368.18s)]
*  use of petrochemical products the increase of phthalates into the human body from [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4369.78s)]
*  Contamination has caused people's taints to shrink balls to shrink dicks to shrink sperm counts to drop and miscarriages to go up [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4376.62s)]
*  and they think that [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4383.9400000000005s)]
*  If you think about that like that is like causing gender to just kind of compress and to become like more ambiguous [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4386.34s)]
*  And in the future if that continues to happen [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4393.3s)]
*  What what does that mean? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=4397.18s)]

*  But I think there's gonna be a lot of people that are doing that to make a living [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5242.66s)]
*  The problem is where's the money coming from? Is it gonna be subscribers paying other subscribers? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5246.02s)]
*  Is it gonna be like a hierarchy like someone who makes like a million dollars a month paying someone who makes? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5250.900000000001s)]

*  I think you have to have the whole body attached to it [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5270.4s)]
*  Like what do most girls on only fans do do they show like bikini pictures? Like what are they doing showing feet? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5272.38s)]

*  Oh and so that gets everybody excited and then they get more like so they have man animals [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5296.9s)]
*  Do like stuff animals do before their owner pulls them away real quick [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5301.96s)]
*  I heard that a lot of these girls what they're when they're interacting with people online [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5304.54s)]
*  They're not really doing it that they hire a company and then someone writes these letters because like if you feel like you're gonna respond [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5309.5s)]
*  To people and text them like how many of them are you gonna do this to like how many can you how many days? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5315.82s)]

*  How many you're responding to or who's doing it? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5324.74s)]
*  Like if you have like say if you have a million subscribers on only fans and you get a hundred thousand messages a month [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5327.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta have somebody helping you [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5335.54s)]
*  Maybe they just have a person like a service who writes like sexy things like thank you, sweetie heart heart [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5337.22s)]

*  Can I just have about eight seconds about the rooms the number of rooms in around? Uh, no, that's good [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5813.22s)]

*  If I'll come here, you know, he's getting an apartment. Oh, I was gonna try for well [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5824.259999999999s)]

*  Um, oh, this is my question. Okay, so sometimes I you know [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5832.78s)]
*  I've had times in my life where I've thought too much about regrets and stuff in my life, right? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5836.86s)]
*  Yeah, we've talked about that some in the past like looking in the past too much right or attaching myself to the past [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5841.0199999999995s)]
*  Was there is there has there been anything along your journey that you've kind of regretted and then how do you deal with regret? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5846.339999999999s)]
*  I mean individual choices and mistakes [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5852.1s)]
*  Yeah, but ultimately you learn from those so like no cuz like even the regrets the bad things or the stupid things [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5855.42s)]
*  You learn not to do bad things or stupid things, you know [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5862.660000000001s)]
*  Those all those things are beneficial in some way if you can get through them, you know, you know if you like [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5866.3s)]
*  Did something that were that resulted in someone's death or some something horrible like that? Yeah, it'd be a terrible regret [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5872.860000000001s)]
*  but I've been very fortunate that that hasn't happened but [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5879.18s)]
*  The dumb shit that I've done or the bad mistakes that I've made they've taught me, you know, you learn like that's why failure [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5882.34s)]
*  So important like failing and fucking up and making mistakes. It's very important. That's how you learn [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5889.42s)]
*  Let's see the bad feeling that you get from something that you shouldn't have done or wish you didn't do or wish you did better [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5895.5s)]
*  Like especially failing at something where you half-assed it and you just feel like a fucking loser like that just teaches you [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5902.860000000001s)]
*  Teaches you to get your shit together [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5910.46s)]
*  Well, you have such a good ability to learn from those things some people I think kind of repent [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5912.74s)]
*  You know, it's just like it gets repetitive for some people that's dangerous. Yeah, it's dangerous to dwell on past mistakes [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5916.639999999999s)]
*  Because people sort of define themselves by the worst moments that they've ever had and if that's the case like some people are stuck [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5922.759999999999s)]
*  In high school, you know [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5928.679999999999s)]
*  They're stuck in [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5930.259999999999s)]
*  failures that they had like when they were first getting jobs and they always think that they're a loser and they they don't like the [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5931.62s)]
*  Feeling of failure so they keep low expectations so that they never have to feel that [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5936.94s)]
*  You gotta get through it. You gotta get through bad feelings. You gotta get through [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5941.82s)]
*  You gotta get through failure [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5947.0199999999995s)]
*  It's very important and you get through it by just picking yourself back up and moving forward and going [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5948.419999999999s)]
*  But it's hard for a lot of people because they that sting [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5954.2s)]
*  They never get over it the feeling of failure and they don't have a good support system like good friends like having a good community [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5957.46s)]
*  Friends it's very very important because you could feel like down like if you've been [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5964.28s)]
*  Girl broke up with you and you feel like you're the worst you're a fucking loser [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5968.96s)]
*  Like you're a piece of shit [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5972.76s)]
*  But then you go out with your friends and you have a few laughs and next thing you know, you're laughing and you're like [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5973.719999999999s)]
*  I'm alright. We'll be alright and then maybe you meet a new lady. Yeah [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5977.88s)]
*  Yeah, and she like picks you up and you're like, oh we're gonna be okay and then you learn from the last mistakes [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5981.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's life. It's just those feelings of failure are so hard [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5986.8s)]
*  They're so hard to get over and they they overwhelm people and some people can't get past them and then [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5991.8s)]
*  Every time some new thing comes up when you have to rise to the occasion [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=5997.88s)]
*  You have to perform you think about that time you failed and it fucks your head up man. You think I'm a fucking loser [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6002.12s)]
*  I can't do this. I'm gonna fail. I'm gonna fuck up, you know, they're bombing [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6007.16s)]
*  Like how many times have you had a bad set and you're like god damn it. I suck at comedy [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6011.599999999999s)]
*  I can't do this. I can't do this. I suck at comedy has just said I just suck [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6015.36s)]
*  And then you define yourself that way and you got to get over it [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6020.08s)]
*  Yeah, I do notice thankfully it you never have too bad in a row either which is kind of interesting [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6023.76s)]
*  Well, you learn from that one and you like coming out guns blazing for the next show. Yeah [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6027.72s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it activates some senses in you [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6033.320000000001s)]
*  Did you feel like you learned that from somebody or did you always just have that kind of intuition when it comes to that kind? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6035.400000000001s)]
*  Of stuff [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6040.0s)]
*  I think I learned it from martial arts because you get your ass kicked and like you don't want to get your ass kicked again [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6040.280000000001s)]
*  You either quit fighting or you learn how to get a lot better, you know [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6045.68s)]
*  and then you get your ass kicked in training which happens all the time and [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6049.240000000001s)]
*  You know you learn from those mistakes you learn, you know [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6052.72s)]
*  Like maybe you were stationary too much or maybe you telegraphed too much or maybe you you got tired [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6056.0s)]
*  And you haven't been doing your cardio like those those failures that you have for martial arts are so [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6060.9400000000005s)]
*  Consequential because you get hurt like you physically get punished and then you don't want that to happen again [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6068.280000000001s)]
*  So you got to be either quit or get way better. I [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6074.02s)]
*  Like that and that's great for a lot of my listeners a lot of guys, you know, or just you know a lot of guys [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6078.38s)]

*  That's why there's so many motivational documentaries and motivational Instagram pages is because people need stuff like that [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6093.52s)]
*  They need something and generally the best version of it is coming from someone who's experienced fuck-ups and gotten through it [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreBmGkuEBc&t=6099.5199999999995s)]
