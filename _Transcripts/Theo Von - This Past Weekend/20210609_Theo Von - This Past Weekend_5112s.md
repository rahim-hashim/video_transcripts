*  You know people bobbing for apples in it, you know drinking and then [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1230.94s)]
*  Maybe your buddy's wife's over there bobbing and nobody's looking and you go touch her ass a little or something [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1235.1799999999998s)]

*  So it doesn't matter if there's people next to you or on your whatever [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1274.78s)]
*  You know little Lawrence will be in there and he'll be wearing a little freaking Anthony as a scarf and [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1278.06s)]

*  It's very strong [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1300.8600000000001s)]
*  You know as we when we get it as we become adults, I find I become more [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1302.8600000000001s)]

*  Proton or a neutron, but when you're young you're just part of the electricity [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1309.18s)]
*  So anyway, we had a bunch of children in there and [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1315.82s)]
*  We'd never been in a hot tub people didn't know, you know people drinking the water and doing all you know washing their hair and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1319.1s)]

*  But people didn't know we didn't know [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1336.14s)]
*  We weren't enjoying it [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1338.94s)]
*  And the directions got all wet immediately. So nobody knew what they said [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1341.18s)]
*  then we were just hot tubbing and [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1346.3s)]
*  Pretending we were in fans somebody wrote Tahiti on the on a sign and nailed it to the tree right there and god [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1349.18s)]
*  We were living it up [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1355.58s)]
*  And there was one fella named CJ and he was older than us he was probably [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1358.22s)]
*  He could have been 15 he could have been 60 [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1363.3799999999999s)]
*  You know he had us [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1367.46s)]
*  He had scars on his back. I don't he might have been a slave, you know [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1368.98s)]
*  He's white guy, but he might have been enslaved at one point. I don't know. He'd been through a lot [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1372.26s)]
*  You know, you've been through a lot and I remember he had hair kind of around the top of his pants on the back [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1377.86s)]
*  And [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1385.86s)]
*  So anyway, we're all in the hot tub we're enjoying it. We're probably maybe 10 or 12 [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=1386.82s)]

*  But she said she's been hearing weird stuff. This is the final straw [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2298.6000000000004s)]
*  like if you like [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2303.0800000000004s)]
*  If there's like, uh, you know somebody been making muffins and they left a bolt, you know a um [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2306.0400000000004s)]
*  muffin [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2312.5200000000004s)]
*  stuff [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2314.12s)]
*  You know stuff and out on your counter then you got to call the police. I mean you can't [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2316.04s)]
*  You can't be like, hmm. What is this? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2322.6s)]
*  Like what is there somebody making muffins am I sleep muffining? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2326.3599999999997s)]
*  Like she says this is the final straw the final I whether I I just wonder what some of the other straws were [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2332.52s)]
*  You know, I wonder what some of the other straws were where you finally found a piece of mustache in the tub [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2340.28s)]
*  And now the guys obviously changed his you know, whatever intel you had on him earlier [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2347.1600000000003s)]
*  This guy shaved his hair. This guy's changing the game up. You know, he could have dyed his skin [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2351.96s)]
*  You know, you could be looking for somebody who's jaundiced next month. I mean who knows [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2358.1200000000003s)]
*  But I think one way to do it here's how I would do it [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2363.48s)]
*  Because obviously it is dude does drugs or whatever and if you're willing to hide in somebody's house [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2366.76s)]
*  If you're willing to be out there just straight goldie locking [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2375.32s)]
*  Or male goldie lock, I mean that's the same the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2379.7200000000003s)]
*  Here's what I would do. I would stand against the wall young lady [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2383.48s)]
*  And I would just start counting. I would put my hands my face. I'm like one [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2387.08s)]
*  two [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2391.8s)]
*  Three [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2393.96s)]
*  I think maybe it'll then know that maybe they'll think it's a game [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2397.8s)]
*  Or maybe just stand in the living room like you know what I can't find you I can't find you [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2403.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. How do you but it's crazy put a little trap out [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2411.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, here's a way to find out if the man is thinking of anything sexual if it's a rapist or not [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2418.36s)]
*  I mean, you know, you can get your little mouse trap put a little condom on it [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2423.96s)]
*  And if he you know if you hear that thing pop off at night, you know, a [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2431.48s)]
*  You caught him [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2437.4s)]
*  and b [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2438.84s)]
*  He's a rapist, baby. So [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2440.6800000000003s)]
*  But I wish you well, it's sad to see that men are now the goldie locks in America [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2443.6400000000003s)]
*  You know you got this lady out here kind of got that tea pain vibe and you got men out here goldie locking [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2448.6s)]
*  But that's god's plan baby and that's where we are praise god, baby [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2455.48s)]

*  um [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2468.68s)]
*  I'm getting excited about this tour [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2470.52s)]
*  uh [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2473.08s)]
*  I'm gonna figure that out. I'm also i'm gonna take a i'm gonna take a little bit of time and go to a [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2474.68s)]
*  Do a little bit of like a retreat [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2480.12s)]
*  and do some um [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2483.08s)]
*  Just deal with some try and deal with some stuff i've been dealing with [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2486.2s)]
*  You know over the past year, uh, i've talked about it maybe a year and a half even i've just really been dealing with some anger issues [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2490.9199999999996s)]
*  You know and i'm not trying to be a debbie downer, um [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2498.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's affected a lot of the way that [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2502.2s)]
*  I communicate and that I feel [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2507.56s)]
*  And it's affected the amount of joy and stuff that i'm having in my life [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2514.04s)]
*  And so I want to be a little bit more uh proactive [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2520.2s)]
*  And so i'm gonna [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2525.56s)]
*  Just see about maybe 10 days or something, you know [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2527.08s)]
*  And it's nothing where they're electrocuting you or something [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2530.92s)]
*  You know, it's nothing where they're beating you or anything or amistad and people or anything. It's real [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2534.44s)]
*  I think it's just going to be an organized thing where you can kind of focus [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2540.44s)]
*  And so that's what that's what i'm excited about i'm i'm trying to stay excited [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2546.12s)]
*  You know, I literally have to commit to a to a spot when I get off of the podcast today and [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2551.16s)]
*  So i'm a little scared I guess uh [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2557.48s)]
*  I [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2560.92s)]
*  Think my my biggest thing is do I really want to feel better sometimes? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2563.88s)]
*  You know sometimes it's like do I really want to feel better [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2575.96s)]
*  And i'm not saying that as a downer i'm not trying to bring anybody down like this podcast isn't about bringing anybody down [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2581.4s)]
*  Um, but I damn I sometimes I just I want to I have to be able to share what i'm thinking or feeling [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2587.72s)]
*  Um [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2596.9199999999996s)]
*  And yeah, you know i'm just so hard on myself all the time [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2600.52s)]
*  I just want to start to figure what I have to I have to find some [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2602.52s)]
*  You know, I want to do some excavating there and just see what's going on [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2606.3599999999997s)]
*  And at the same time keep moving forward, you know [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  So my mother sometimes talks to me about well don't sit in the past, you know, don't sit in the past [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2613.48s)]
*  And some of that is super true [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2620.44s)]
*  You know, um [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2625.96s)]
*  But it's sometimes it's also hard to really, you know, I notice whatever things from my past are affecting me from having like [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2628.28s)]
*  committed relationships [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2635.32s)]
*  um [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2637.4s)]
*  You know feeling okay [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2639.7200000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2642.52s)]
*  Being willing to dance at weddings, I don't like doing that honestly [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2646.2s)]
*  I've been so scared about dancing at a wedding. Sometimes I wish that somebody will stand up during the nuptials or whatever and say and protest [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2650.7599999999998s)]
*  So at least we won't have to dance, you know, so [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2658.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2662.04s)]
*  but [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2663.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm hopeful and um, and everything's fine. I'm not like [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2664.6s)]
*  In a bad place. I'm actually in an okay place [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2669.16s)]
*  But I want to take us some time and just kind of see what's going on [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2672.2s)]
*  um [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2675.9599999999996s)]
*  And I have a little bit of time. I have a little bit of space [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2677.24s)]
*  and so i'm thankful to god that I have this a little bit of space in my life where I can [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2679.9599999999996s)]
*  Kind of investigate it and I can share with you whatever i'm seeing or thinking [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2684.3599999999997s)]

*  You know what I don't know what that means exactly [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2708.2s)]
*  But I think you know, it's like [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2715.56s)]
*  I think we're in a weird place in society where we realize maybe [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2718.92s)]
*  That all these things we're getting aren't really they're great and they're cool and it's nice to have successes, but if we don't have [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2722.6s)]
*  A bigger feeling of success inside of ourself or comfort [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2733.0s)]
*  You know, it's almost like uh [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2739.08s)]
*  It's almost like an awakening in a way where we realize oh there's got to be more out there [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2744.84s)]

*  I can't hear them as good [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2826.36s)]
*  Like I can hear them but I used to be able to hear them and feel them and I miss that man [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2832.28s)]
*  You know, I miss that and I don't know what inside of me is making me [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2840.1200000000003s)]
*  Uncomfortable, you know, we're making me [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2847.94s)]
*  Me [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2851.0s)]
*  But when I hear when I see people I hear people and somebody's talking and they're sharing something that's important to them man [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2853.08s)]
*  I want to be able to [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2858.44s)]
*  hear it and feel it [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2860.2s)]

*  And yeah, I just I want to be able to do that and uh, and I don't know and it's just important to me [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2866.68s)]
*  You know, it's important to me [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYL5r22S-k&t=2875.48s)]
