# Andrew Huberman | This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #585
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I)
*  Today's guest is a neuroscientist. He's a professor. He's a podcaster. He hosts one [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=0.0s)]
*  of the biggest shows in the world called Huberman Lab, where he focuses on helping us to become [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5.88s)]
*  our best selves and get the most out of our bodies. I believe that he's one of the people [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=13.76s)]
*  who's responsible for bringing health and self-evaluation into the mainstream. I'm grateful [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=19.16s)]
*  for the chance to finally link up today with the one and only Andrew Huberman. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=27.32s)]
*  Whitney's been amazing to me. Since I moved to LA, she kind of ushered me in. I didn't [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=34.2s)]
*  understand LA. I moved to Topanga during the pandemic, set up there with my bulldog, started [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=56.63999999999999s)]
*  doing the podcast in a closet. And she kind of taught me about LA and I'd never done anything [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=63.12s)]
*  public facing. But we can talk about, I mean, I think we should mention what a cute baby Henry is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=68.24s)]
*  That kid is so cute. Oh, the baby is beautiful. I think bring up Henry. Bring up Henry Cummins. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=75.56s)]
*  Or I don't even know if it has a stage. I have no idea if the baby has a front name or last name. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's Henry Cummins. Oh my God. That's beautiful. Oh yeah. Look at him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=86.8s)]
*  He's got your haircut. Wow. He does, dude. And you can tell he cuts it himself too. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He's a, you know, I've met him and he's just such a good natured kid. He looks AI right there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=98.72s)]
*  He looks like Dermot Kennedy a little as well there. He's, he loves animals, which is great [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=105.44s)]
*  because she's, you know, surrounded herself with animals. Are you trying to attack a resemblance [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=111.52s)]
*  there? I'm just saying the child has a slight resemblance to the remarkable crooner Dermot [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=116.24s)]
*  Kennedy. And look, whoa, hold on. Whoa, bro. I'm going to have to call my sponsor, dude. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=122.72s)]
*  Oh, that's a great photo. That is super cool. Yeah. So I think that last shirt says, I think [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=131.92s)]
*  that shirt says single mom. Yeah. Ooh. It's like a rock and roll. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=140.08s)]
*  When he's a punk rocker, we have a lot of friends through the punk rock community. Oh yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=145.28s)]
*  And she sometimes posts with Chris Cole, who's a guy I grew up watching skateboarding. He's a, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=149.52s)]
*  I think he's in the Tony Hawk skateboarder game. Is he bring him up, bring up a picture of Chris [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=154.48s)]
*  Cole. I've heard of Nat King Cole and I've heard of Cole. There he is. Yeah. He's a beast famous for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=158.56s)]
*  Oh, doing a tre flip down Wallenberg, which in the Bay area, Wallenberg school is famous for Stair [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=167.68s)]
*  huge. So he, you know, he's a black, it's a staircase. It's a school. And so they call it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=174.72s)]
*  Wallenberg for skate. I grew up skateboarding and there it is. Wallenberg is the third one down there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=179.12s)]
*  Right. Oh yeah. So this is like, this is one of the things that made Chris legendary that. And he [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=184.16s)]
*  always had those silly wristbands on not risk guards, wristbands, but there's a long time, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=192.0s)]
*  that's a lot bigger than it might look. No, it's, and you actually have to, now they build roll-ins, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=197.84s)]
*  but you back then you would push in down the avenues. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=203.2s)]
*  This is so sick. It's just him trying it over and over and over and over. Oh, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=211.04s)]
*  Oh, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  and you can kind of start even just watching this, you start to gain the, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=222.96s)]
*  and it's all bolts as they say he's lands perfect. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=228.88s)]
*  God, it's just so crazy. How many times it's just such a little piece of perfection. It's like just [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=232.88s)]
*  such an organized specific moment, like the point of a pen when they, uh, when they land those things [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=239.2s)]
*  super satisfying to watch. It's got to feel incredible. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. He looks [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=246.56s)]
*  a little bit like your assistant that came in today too. Oh yeah. He does look a little bit [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=251.28s)]
*  like Greg. You're right. They have a resemblance. He looks a little bit like Greg. Yeah. And they're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=254.4s)]
*  friends. So that's interesting. But, but yeah, that baby God, I would have loved her been her son or [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=259.36s)]
*  been, um, or just had a change. Yeah. Like even I'm glad that, yeah, I'm happy that she has a baby. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=263.84s)]
*  Well, she's got that menagerie of animals like Mona, her pit bull Ridgeback mix. I love, I also, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=269.84s)]
*  I have a close relationship to her Great Dane Frank. Oh, let me see that. Like right now I [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=276.8s)]
*  don't have a dog. So a little while ago, I was like, I need some dog time. So I went over there [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=282.0s)]
*  and he thinks he's a puppy and he crawled up on me on the couch and that's different one. Frank's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=286.72s)]
*  gray, but that one's mixed. There he is. That's probably Frank. And he, uh, and I woke up at two [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  in the morning. She had covered us with a blanket on the sofa and Frank was breathing into my face. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  And it was, uh, it was a moment, but, uh, I love Great Danes cause they, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  they think they're little dogs, but they're giant dogs. So anyway, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=306.4s)]
*  never a dull moment at Casa de Cummings. No, she's always had excitement and she definitely [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=310.96s)]
*  will free an animal. If there's even, you know, she'll, uh, she'll release a animal from anything. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=316.4s)]
*  Oh, if she hears that there's a, like a dog running around in the street or I, I think this is right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Check me on this. We'll have to ask her, but a while back, I think that she was [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=329.6s)]
*  trying to rescue a giraffe. You know, you get these wealthy people that have exotic animals. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=332.8s)]
*  They want a giraffe or an elephant or something. So she'll, she'll drop everything and like, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=337.6s)]
*  go try and rescue a giraffe. She's a real animal lover. She's definitely, uh, who's the guy [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=341.36s)]
*  William Wordsworth or whatever who's no, who had the animal movie, Dr. Doolittle. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=348.0s)]
*  She's like the female Dr. Doolittle can talk to the animals. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would love [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  to see her do the show just for animals, even like a live performance, just for animals [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=359.28s)]
*  and, and see how it goes. But yeah, she'll, she'll pet anything, but I'm glad she's got [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  that beautiful baby over there. Um, Andrew Huberman, good to see you, dude. Great to meet [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=368.32s)]
*  you in person. Finally. We've corresponded a little bit, but you too, man, I'm a big fan. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=373.2s)]
*  And I, uh, heard your name mentioned at the inauguration of the president of the United States. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  And I went, this is wild worlds colliding, right? I think Dana White mentioned Joe Rogan [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=382.0s)]
*  and you at the inauguration of the most powerful person in the, in the world. And, and who else? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry. The note boys. Well, he mentioned also the note boys. And then he mentioned, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  and the most powerful person, Joe Rogan. We definitely were like just some satellites in the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  orbit, but it was really sweet. I mean, I think you catch Dana White at 2 AM, you know, and he'll, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=403.12s)]
*  and he'll drop some different names and stuff. But, um, yeah, that was crazy when that happened. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=408.24s)]
*  I remember my ex-girlfriend's mom just texted me like the, they just mentioned you on the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=412.56s)]
*  inauguration address or something. And I was like, what is going on that, that podcasting [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=416.4s)]
*  has become this thing is just such a part of the universe, you know? Um, what do you think it is? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, like, what do you think it is? Cause you may even have more of a scientific look at it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=428.64s)]
*  Uh, why is podcasting just, it's as, it's as common as like somebody saying the New York times [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=433.84s)]
*  five years ago. Yeah. I have a lot of thoughts about this. Uh, first of all, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  it's interesting that we looked at skateboarding earlier. I've been lucky enough to get in on some [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=444.0s)]
*  things in the early phase, not the very earliest, but the early phase when things were kind of small [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=448.32s)]
*  and there wasn't a lot of money at first. And then things kind of blow up. When I was younger, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=453.76s)]
*  I got into skateboarding. Every kid in my town played soccer, swam. I got really excited about [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=458.56s)]
*  skateboarding when it was kind of at a low point in terms of like, there weren't a lot of kids [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=462.08s)]
*  skateboarding. It had gone through a phase of popularity than it had died in the early 90s. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=467.68s)]
*  What town was that you're in? I grew up in the South Bay area. So this is what now is known as [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=471.68s)]
*  South Palo Alto before the internet. So, you know, we worked hard when we were in high school to get [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=476.48s)]
*  a skate park put in, there weren't many skate parks. It was really small. We used to take the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=481.76s)]
*  seven F bus up to San Francisco, the famed Embarcadero or EMB crowd. This is where people [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  like Rob Dyrdek would show up back then. He didn't have his show. Actually the photographer for my [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=490.48s)]
*  podcast, my playback was taking photos of all those guys. A lot of those guys now went on to have, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=495.52s)]
*  Rob Dyrdek's famous has his own show of ridiculousness and has done a bunch of other [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=500.56s)]
*  things. Robin Big. Tony Hawk, of course, has lasted through all the peaks and valleys of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  skateboarding. Pretty impressive. You know, so back then it was really small. I was going to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=508.88000000000005s)]
*  contests where I met Frank Hawk. Tony's dad was kind of running it a little bit like a baseball [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=512.48s)]
*  league. Bring up a picture of Frank Hawk. You never see him, huh? Yeah, Frank and Nancy Hawk. I'll tell you a funny story, actually. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=517.12s)]
*  When I was 14, I went to a contest at the Linda Vista Boys Club out in the middle of nowhere. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=520.72s)]
*  And when the contest ended, I was 14. When the contest ended, Frank came around and asked me [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=527.68s)]
*  and this kid, Billy Waldman, who was like, they called him the demon child. He's kind of a wild [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=533.12s)]
*  one. And he was my friend. If you put Billy Walden demon child, he'll show up. You'll see it in his [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=537.3599999999999s)]
*  face. Watch this. Ready? That's what a demon child looks like. He was a good kid. But in any case, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  what ended up happening was Frank was like, Hey, where are you guys going? And we're like, well, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  we don't know. I was going to take the bus to Lancaster, see my friend Joe Rikubosch and somehow [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=553.28s)]
*  get home. And he was like, no, no, you guys can't do that. He was like a real protective dad. So he [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=557.04s)]
*  and Nancy Hawk took me in. I got to stay in Tony Hawk's bedroom that night with all the trophies [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=561.04s)]
*  everywhere. And they took me out to dinner and I'll never forget. And this is how I got back in touch [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=567.28s)]
*  with Tony in recent years. They had black coffee after dinner at like 8 PM. And I'd never seen that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=572.64s)]
*  So a few years ago on Instagram, I wrote to Tony and said, Hey, you know, your parents took me in [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=578.48s)]
*  when I was a little bit stranded. And if you don't believe me, they drink coffee at 8 30 PM after [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=582.0s)]
*  journey row back. And he goes, no way. You're the only person. The only way to know that is to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=588.0s)]
*  actually have a meal with them. So anyway, you know, skateboarding back then I got out of it. I [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=591.2s)]
*  wasn't very good. Okay. I got put on a team out of sympathy. I tried, but I kept getting hurt. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=596.08s)]
*  Team. What do you mean? And I think the Dutch drink coffee late at night. Bring that up real quick. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=600.8s)]
*  Who's drinking coffee very late at night or see if Tony Hawk is Amsterdamian. If he's an Amsterdamian, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=604.8s)]
*  I believe he, he looks Amsterdamian to me. Tony is like six foot five. I know the Dutch and his son [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  is, is tall as well. You can pick a more perfect last name for a professional skateboarder, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's another reason I believe that he's all in addition to his talent, which has helped [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=622.88s)]
*  him stay in the test of time is such a, a moniker. There's nothing like that. Tony Hawk. It's Tony is [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=627.36s)]
*  the most relatable name in the world. And then it just like, who don't want to be that Tony Hawk is [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=634.0s)]
*  a predominantly British Isles descent. Oh, damn. I was hoping we'd get him in Amsterdam. All right. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=638.08s)]
*  That's all good. But yeah. So what were you saying, brother? Sorry. No. So got into that early and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=642.88s)]
*  then got hurt on a team. Yeah. Yeah. So I got sponsored by a little, a company called thunder [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=649.5200000000001s)]
*  trucks, spit fire wheels. They put me on as sympathy. I'm, I'm still friends with the team manager [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=654.0s)]
*  from back then. And he'll tell you is out of sympathy, but I got to see a lot of friends turn [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=658.32s)]
*  pro start companies. Danny way and Colin McKay started DC. Oh yeah. Which eventually sold a [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=662.48s)]
*  Quicksilver. They did that also with a Ken block who was a rally car driver. Unfortunately passed [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=668.24s)]
*  away a few years ago. He was the guy that do Jim Conner, all the driving around cities, you know, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=673.04s)]
*  jump. You haven't seen Jim Conner in San Francisco. Oh man, we're bringing back all the stuff. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=677.76s)]
*  No, this is awesome. Pull this up. So if you look at, if you look at San Francisco, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=681.2s)]
*  and you say Ken block, this is, I mean, so Ken unfortunately died in this snowmobile accident [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=686.24s)]
*  a few years ago, but this on YouTube is unbelievable. I would go to the middle of it to really get a [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=692.0s)]
*  sense of, and so they would drive around. They basically just, they shut down big segments of the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=698.32s)]
*  city. So that's down at the peers. And then all this 119 million views, all this aerial footage, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=705.52s)]
*  shutting that jump. Why not just jump between two streets in San Francisco? So that was, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=713.92s)]
*  yeah. My friend, Mike Blayback was the one photographing all this for DC. So DC was initially [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=719.52s)]
*  skateboarding Danny and Colin and Danny's older brother, Damon, started DC. It does actually stood [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=724.32s)]
*  for something called drawers clothing, but DC, Danny, Colin and DC shoes, right? And then they [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  went snowboarding rally car, BMX, motocross, monster, you know, monster rock star. Oh, that was born out [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=734.48s)]
*  of essentially skateboarding and BMX early on. Then X games took off. So it's kind of like how, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=742.72s)]
*  you know, in the nineties, skateboarding was really small. Then it blew up, then it dies a [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=748.0s)]
*  little bit and it keeps coming back. Now it's in the Olympics. Okay. So when I got into neuroscience, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  cause that's my official job and professor of neuroscience up at Stanford, I don't currently [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=757.12s)]
*  run my lab anymore. I tooled that down in 2023 so I could focus more on the podcast, but I still [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  teach medical students, graduate students and undergraduates. Okay. So you're still practicing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=766.24s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. And I ran a lab for more than a decade and really got into science when I was in college. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  I decided, listen, I'm not going to become a professional skateboarder, not a musician. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=774.72s)]
*  I got to do something with my life. I got into biology and psychology and I started working in [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=778.1600000000001s)]
*  a lab. And so even when I got into neuroscience, it was early. There was no such thing called a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=782.24s)]
*  neuroscience degree or a neuroscientist. There was biology, there was genetics, but there wasn't [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=786.88s)]
*  something official. Then came the decade of the brain and now neurosciences everywhere. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=791.52s)]
*  Yeah. You hear about it a lot. Yeah. So when I didn't hear about it 10 years ago, for sure. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=795.36s)]
*  You did not. I mean, and it really drew from people from different fields. And then now we [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=798.64s)]
*  have a better, not complete, but we can talk about better understanding of lots of different [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=802.8s)]
*  things, memory addiction, et cetera. When I got into podcasting, I started my podcast in 2021. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=806.56s)]
*  As we were talking about before, it was just, you know, small closet. I was living in Topanga, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=812.4s)]
*  kind of self-appointed sabbatical. It was the pandemic. Everything shut down. My Bulldog, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=816.0s)]
*  Bulldog Mastiff Costello. And he passed away at some point. 2021, I had to put him down. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  I had to do it myself. No, I will at home. I had them come. He hated the vet, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, I mean, a Bulldog is an amazing animal. The contract between a Bulldog and owner is very [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=831.52s)]
*  simple. They will die for you and you can feel that they will die for you. But if your life is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=835.92s)]
*  not on the line, they're not doing shit at all. Yeah. That's the contract. They will die for you. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=841.84s)]
*  They also take areas. They've also taken nap for you. They will take a nap for you. So he used to [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=846.16s)]
*  just snore. You can hear him snoring in our early episodes and fart and you know, that's what they [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=850.72s)]
*  do. But if there was a threat, they don't hesitate, you know, shit. He was skunked something like 27 [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=855.12s)]
*  times because they don't learn. He was stung by bees. No, skunked. Oh, yeah. They always say [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=861.84s)]
*  they're two kinds of dogs, dogs that get skunked once and then all the other kinds of dogs. But in [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=866.72s)]
*  any case, you know, we started the podcast and we weren't thinking about, oh, we're going to make [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=870.8s)]
*  money with this or it'll be a big podcast. Sat down, put up a couple of cameras and me and, you [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=874.64s)]
*  know, my, what I now call my producer, but my friend Rob Moore just did that. Mike Blayback from [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=879.52s)]
*  DC because I knew people from skateboarding. He took the photos. And then what happened between 2021 [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=884.24s)]
*  and 2025 is you all, right. Thanks in large part to Joe, right. We could talk about, I have theories [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=889.44s)]
*  about why Joe is the king of podcasting and the biggest media channel on the planet, not just [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=896.4s)]
*  podcasting. What happened was people wanted to hear conversation where it's not scripted and where [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=901.6s)]
*  the ads and commercials are things that people actually use. Right. You know, and, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=910.48s)]
*  and it went from this little niche community of comedians and people that like to talk about UFC [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=915.12s)]
*  to, you know, Lex Friedman was the one that would inspire me to start a podcast. So he was my kind [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=921.28s)]
*  of, uh, my brother in crime in terms of podcast Eskimo or whatever. Yeah, because he was an [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=926.56s)]
*  academic. He is an academic. Right. I mean, he, he has a PhD. A lot of people don't know this, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=931.36s)]
*  but it's a doctor Lex Friedman. So he's not a medical doctor, but he has a PhD. And he was [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=935.28s)]
*  the AI computer science guy. And I was the neuroscience guy, but then I'm also very [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=940.48s)]
*  interested in health and health and fitness. But you guys didn't podcast together. No, we've done [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=945.68s)]
*  a few, but a few episodes together, but we were kind of the science podcast. Oh, for sure. And [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  then it just, you know, the comedians led the way, right. You, Joe, uh, you know, Mark Marin, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  Mark Marin, and then it just kind of Pete Holmes. Pete Holmes was a big one early. Remember Pete [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=960.0s)]
*  Holmes was before everybody. Yeah. It was a very early podcast, but no, I, it's definitely gotten [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=966.64s)]
*  where, um, I think it's nice not having people like, you know, sometimes I'll, I'll see things, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=973.12s)]
*  people seem like, oh, this, this group, now you're working with this group or you're working with [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=978.32s)]
*  this group or you've been like, uh, infiltrated by, uh, this country or this idea. It's like, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=981.44s)]
*  no, it don't work for anybody. It just, I try my best, you know, and, and, um, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=988.16s)]
*  Oh, you do an amazing job because it's so, it's pure. So the parallels I was setting out with [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=991.76s)]
*  skateboarding and neuroscience, and then this, I realized at some point, and I, and you know, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=996.9599999999999s)]
*  I'll get accused of name dropping, but I'm very blessed to be very close friends with Rick Rubin. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1001.76s)]
*  I spent a lot of time with Rick either here when he's in the States or fascinating. Rick Rubin is, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1005.28s)]
*  I know almost he's a music producer, music producer. You know, he's also produced comedy. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  He did, uh, he worked with, uh, Andrew Dice Clay and he has great stories about that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1015.28s)]
*  Oh, I bet he does. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1021.12s)]
*  You know, and so what's interesting is I talked to Rick about this. I was like, why is podcasting [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1022.56s)]
*  experiencing this surge? The question you asked. And he said, and this is kind of how Rick talks. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1028.48s)]
*  He, he actually talks like this. He's like, because it's real, you know, people, when they're, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  when something's early, they're not thinking about how it's going to be received. You're not [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  thinking about whether or not your corporate sponsors are going to be happy. This is why Rick, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1042.0s)]
*  you know, remember Rick produced Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1045.6s)]
*  Adele, Kanye. Um, he's doing classical music stuff now, country, and he tends to work with [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1053.28s)]
*  people at the beginning and then not necessarily again, maybe on a song or two. And I asked him [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1060.32s)]
*  why. And he's like, because at the beginning they're in what Josh Waitzkin, the great chess [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1066.16s)]
*  player has described as the pre-consciousness phase of creativity. You're not trying to defend [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1070.16s)]
*  a title. You know, you're not trying to defend a title. You're not thinking about how it's going [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1074.88s)]
*  to be received because you really have nothing to compare it to. You have nothing to lose. Yeah. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  Listen, when Chris Cole, 360 flipped down Wallenberg, someone was filming it, right? But [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1082.88s)]
*  after he did that, I'm sure that he thought about, God, like, how do I, how do I like supersede that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1089.1200000000001s)]
*  the next time? How do I, but when, when it's the next big thing, you're just thinking about the next [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  thing and there's something really beautiful to that. And that's what people tend to gravitate [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1098.96s)]
*  toward, whether or not it's media podcasting, skateboarding, motocross, I don't care what it is. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1103.44s)]
*  We can feel when something is real. In fact, Rick has this great saying, and I love it because [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1108.4s)]
*  one time I saw this whole thing in the media related to somebody I knew, and it turned out [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1113.52s)]
*  that their whole company was just a complete sham. At least that's what the media was claiming. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1117.2s)]
*  And he said to me, he goes, it's all lies. And I said, yeah, apparently it's all lies. And he said, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1122.08s)]
*  no, no, no, no, everything is made up. He said, there's only two things that are true [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1127.68s)]
*  nature, like the laws of chemistry, biology, physics, and professional wrestling. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1133.2s)]
*  He said, because everyone knows professional wrestling is made up. And Rick watches 12 hours [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1141.04s)]
*  a week of professional wrestling. And when I go and see him and we watch professional wrestling, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1146.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm like, why do you, why do you watch so much professional wrestling? And he said, you know, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1150.4s)]
*  it relaxes me. And also you can see all the theater of life there. And he also likes that [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1154.24s)]
*  people don't actually get hurt. But you're also wondering, wait, was that really part of the act? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1160.32s)]
*  Yeah. And when you look at politics or you look at the world, you know, a lot of it's made up, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1164.56s)]
*  like Bitcoin's on a run today. Everyone's excited, broke 109 or 110. I mean, great, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1170.0s)]
*  but Bitcoin's made up. Right. I mean, its value is dependent on people's kind of perceived value [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1175.76s)]
*  of it. Right. And so he's right. Everything basically is made up. And so when you capture [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1182.08s)]
*  something that's real to a person, like a song and the way they sing it, and they're not comparing [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  it to the way they sang it last time, they're not thinking about whether or not their tour is [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1193.6799999999998s)]
*  bigger than the other big tour that's out there. There's something that I think really resonates [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1197.1999999999998s)]
*  with people. And we just go, wow, like that's, you know, I see it as like, that's the human spirit [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1201.04s)]
*  in action. It's really beautiful. Yeah. It's like seeing a duck, like a little duck, try to take it, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1206.0s)]
*  learn to fly or whatever, you know, that's the funnest part. Once you see a duck flying, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1210.4s)]
*  you're like, ah, it's fine. You know, it can fly. That's great or whatever. Looks cool. Still [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1214.0s)]
*  beautiful. But seeing that duck give those, give those tries and take that shot out of the nest, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1218.88s)]
*  whatever, that's kind of like the funnest part, you know? Well, and the, I think that's the beauty [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1223.52s)]
*  of childhood, right? You know, is, is everything's new. Oh yeah. You know, it's, and you know, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1227.44s)]
*  this is actually a, an interesting segue to dopamine because, you know, dopamine is triggered [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1232.3200000000002s)]
*  by a bunch of things, but mostly by anticipation of something. Okay. Right. So let me think about [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1238.08s)]
*  that. So dopamine is when people say dopamine, cause you hear it all the time, right? Dopamine [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1243.12s)]
*  hits dopamine. Right. You hear about dopamine or give it, you know, you're getting dopamine out of [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1247.52s)]
*  that. You're so what is it? It's a, it's something that's in your body naturally. Okay. So, and [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1252.08s)]
*  where is it hidden in your body behind your ears? Yeah, basically. So real quick lesson in dopamine, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1258.08s)]
*  a neurochemical, some people call it neurotransmitter, neuromodulator. Let's just say [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1264.5600000000002s)]
*  it's a chemical chemical. So it's a liquid. It's a, yeah, basically it's released from neurons, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1268.0s)]
*  neurons are nerve cells and it's going to bind to the next, it's going to park in a parking spot. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1273.92s)]
*  We call it receptor on the next nerve cell and trigger the activity of that nerve cell. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1279.04s)]
*  Nerve cells communicate through electricity and chemicals. The chemicals stimulate electricity. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. And neurons can make the next neuron more active. They can make the next neuron [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1287.6000000000001s)]
*  less active. So this is important. In fact, a good kind of mechanical example is if you flex [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1293.44s)]
*  your bicep, you are inhibiting, you are preventing the neurons that flex your tricep. They are [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1298.16s)]
*  antagonistic muscles. Got it. And as just kind of a parallel where we can get to when you, for [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1304.56s)]
*  instance, smell something you like, it's what's called an appetitive response. It's kind of [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  appetite that inhibits the repulsion response. When you smell vomit or something really putrid, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1318.56s)]
*  you tend to retract and it tends to shut down at the same time, the circuits that would bring you [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1326.24s)]
*  closer to something. So it's, you know, every circuit in the brain is like that there's a push [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1330.8s)]
*  and a pull and accelerator and a break. And if you do want it, let me see others. Yeah. Think of it [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1335.52s)]
*  like a seesaw. One goes up, the other goes down. You know, everything from, if you step on a pin, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1339.92s)]
*  you move your foot up and guess what? What happens? Your other leg automatically extends. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1344.24s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. This is called the monosynaptic stretch reflex. If you touch a fish on the side, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1348.8s)]
*  there's a big old neuron, giant neuron called the Moudner neuron. And what does the fish do? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1353.84s)]
*  It heads in the opposite direction. This is just a, you know, these circuits have been selected [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1358.32s)]
*  for because the dumb fish that went toward the thing that touched it probably got eaten. So [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1363.52s)]
*  all these responses are hardwired responses. This chemical dopamine exists in a couple different [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1368.56s)]
*  places in your brain. It has several roles. The most important ones to know about are that it's [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1374.32s)]
*  involved in generating movement. People with Parkinson's lose the neurons that create dopamine [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1379.04s)]
*  in an area called the substantia nigra. If you were to cut open a human brain, you'd see two dark [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1385.52s)]
*  areas at the bottom of the brain. And in Latin nigra, dark black is down at the bottom of the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1390.64s)]
*  brain. And those are the neurons that degenerate. And there's a picture of it. Maybe we can find, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1396.0s)]
*  it's really impressive. You can see even without a microscope, if you just say, I don't know if you [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1400.48s)]
*  said like actual brain tissue or something. There you go. Look, so see that first, that first one, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1404.32s)]
*  look at that. That's probably without any staining. You're just looking at the brain with no microscope. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1411.04s)]
*  In Parkinson's, those degenerate. You can see it on the right. And what happens is when they're, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1416.32s)]
*  so dopamine is critical for movement. And it's important to keep that in mind because the other [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1420.48s)]
*  thing that dopamine does is it's involved in a set of brain circuits that are involved in [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1425.12s)]
*  motivation. So if you think about any animal, human, dog, rat, cat, monkey, bat, that animal [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  has three choices for movement. You can move towards something. You can stay still, or you [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1437.84s)]
*  can move backward. Dopamine is involved in motivation, not reward. So when you, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1442.7199999999998s)]
*  like what's something that you really enjoy doing? Making quesadillas? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1449.6s)]
*  Making quesadillas. When you get the ingredients and you put them out, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1453.76s)]
*  your dopamine is starting to rise. If you're somebody who likes gambling, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1458.72s)]
*  it's on the way to Vegas. You're walking in, you're getting your chips. It's the feel of the chips. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1465.28s)]
*  The dopamine is going up. This is a hardwired set of circuits that were designed to have us [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1469.68s)]
*  do things that were adaptive. So dopamine starts to rise in anticipation of food when we're hungry, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1476.0s)]
*  cold when we're hot, heat when we're cold, sex when we're horny, and it's going to be involved [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1481.04s)]
*  in anything that we think is going to bring a feeling or a resource. So a lot of dopamine [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1489.12s)]
*  is based on perception? Absolutely. You nailed it. In fact, whether or not we're talking about Bitcoin, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  US dollars, likes on Instagram or X, followers, views, or any of that, the currency is dopamine. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1500.6399999999999s)]
*  There's one currency of motivation. So dopamine is about wanting and craving, not about having. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1513.36s)]
*  Then something happens. You make the case. Okay, hold on. Let me slow down real quick. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1519.28s)]
*  Because sometimes it's hard for me. So I know it might be hard for some of our listeners, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1523.6s)]
*  so the dopamine is based on the motivation. So it's not about the fact that when I'm sitting [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1526.96s)]
*  there and I'm making my quesadilla, the dopamine is knowing that I'm going to get the quesadilla [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  soon. That's dopamine. But then when I actually get the quesadilla, what? Okay. So it depends on [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  the quesadilla. Let's go with three different scenarios. And we could change out quesadilla [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1544.64s)]
*  here for jackpot at the casino, sex, winning a UFC fight or winning the bet on the UFC fight, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1549.84s)]
*  being nervous about asking a girl out and then actually doing it comedy when you move to crowd [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1557.36s)]
*  work and you're like, this feels like I'm out on a tightrope. Okay. Yeah. So any of those things, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1561.6s)]
*  anything where there's a potential payoff, then something happens. Let's use the quesadilla [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1568.1599999999999s)]
*  example because it's straightforward. You have the quesadilla and it's pretty good. It tastes [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1572.6399999999999s)]
*  like the quesadilla you usually make. Okay. What happens? Your dopamine starts dropping a little [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1578.4s)]
*  bit. Not a lot, but you're okay. Yep. It starts dropping. Let's say just by way of example, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1583.52s)]
*  you eat four quesadillas each time. It's going to be a little bit less dopamine from the actual [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1589.92s)]
*  eating of the quesadilla. Yeah. The second quesadilla you can barely even taste it. Sometimes [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1596.5600000000002s)]
*  let's say you bite into the quesadilla and it's like, Oh, this tastes weird. Like there's [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1600.24s)]
*  something off here. Dopamine plummets. So how much dopamine you get depends on the anticipation [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1605.92s)]
*  minus what you actually get something called reward prediction error. But the language doesn't [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1614.16s)]
*  really matter. That's a bunch of nerds speak for when an experience is worse than you expected, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1618.0s)]
*  your dopamine drops below where it started. Wow. When an experience is better than you expected, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1622.48s)]
*  surprise, it's way above where you started and it stays up there for a while. So the dopamine [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1629.36s)]
*  system loves surprise. Now, all of this is related to learning. This is an ancient system designed [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1637.6799999999998s)]
*  for you to learn where are the payoffs, where's the water, where's the food, where are the mates, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1643.4399999999998s)]
*  where's the money, where's the resources. These are ancient circuits that we are doing [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  non-ancient things with. And so for instance, if you do comedy tours, right? When you do your [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1652.88s)]
*  comedy tours and like you really nail it one night, like really nail it. It does two things. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1659.92s)]
*  It raises your baseline level of dopamine. So the next time you go out, you have confidence, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  right? You're still feeling that, but it also raises the threshold for dopamine, right? Now [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1669.8400000000001s)]
*  it's harder to get dopamine. You can't have the same experiences that you had prior to that [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1675.44s)]
*  really killer night and get the same amount of dopamine that you used to. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1681.28s)]
*  It's officially the best time of the year for Hoops fans, playoff drama, buzzer, beaters, and [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1685.68s)]

*  And when you think about dopamine, the most important thing to think about is how quickly [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1921.36s)]
*  does it go up, how quickly and how far does it go down? Because every time it goes up, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1927.4399999999998s)]
*  it goes down. Why? Because remember earlier we were saying everything's like a seesaw. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1933.1999999999998s)]
*  If you feel motivated, there is, and this is so important for people to understand, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1936.8799999999999s)]
*  especially people with compulsions, addictions and this kind of thing, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1940.8s)]
*  the better it feels, the lower you're going to feel afterwards and the longer it will take you [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1944.4799999999998s)]
*  to get back to baseline. So the drug of all drugs for this to really nail home dopamine as a concept. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1949.1999999999998s)]
*  Sex or what? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1956.32s)]
*  Well, behavioral, behaviorally sex, you're right. So, and people have behavior addictions, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1958.32s)]
*  process addictions, methamphetamine. If you were going to look at what creates the biggest rise [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1963.6799999999998s)]
*  in dopamine, the fastest, so it's dopamine over time. Okay. Because listen, when you write jokes [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1970.32s)]
*  or when I'm reading papers, I love reading science papers. I'm like mining for papers. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1976.48s)]
*  Every once in a while I take a little break and I'm super into cephalopods, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1981.6s)]
*  octopuses. I'm building an octopus tank at home right now. So that's kind of my indulgence is [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1984.72s)]
*  octopuses. It's a little bit of dopamine. Methamphetamine is a huge rapid increase in [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1989.6s)]
*  dopamine. Then what happened? How much do we get off that? Bring it up. I just want to see. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=1995.9199999999998s)]
*  So it's how fast it occurs. It occurs within minutes. This is why crack cocaine was so much [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2000.0s)]
*  more addictive than snorted cocaine, right? It was the speed with which it hits the system. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2005.92s)]
*  How much dopamine does an activity release? Baseline is 100%. Food is 150%. So an 50% [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2011.92s)]
*  increase. Video games, 175%. Sex, 200%. I disagree with sex, by the way. I think it depends on, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2018.56s)]
*  you know, if you're, and people should know this, if you live with somebody and you guys are having [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2025.04s)]
*  sex a lot and you've known each other a long time, there's a lot of the reason why people are [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2028.8s)]
*  like looking for novelty in their relationship, et cetera. I'm not trying to be salacious here, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2032.56s)]
*  but new sexual partner is probably about 400, 500%. Yeah. Yeah. And I think most people [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2037.28s)]
*  would not dispute that. Cocaine goes to 450% amphetamine, 1000% methamphetamine, 1300%. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2043.84s)]
*  That meth, that methyl group increases the speed. That speed increases dopamine. So it's almost, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2053.68s)]
*  it could potentially almost be kind of the same, but the speed at which it happens is so much [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2061.7599999999998s)]
*  greater that it intensifies it so much. Right. And remember that the brain is thinking in terms of [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2065.8399999999997s)]
*  approach, pause or retract. So when there's a ton of dopamine, listen, anyone on cocaine or [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2070.9599999999996s)]
*  methamphetamine, everything's a good idea to them. Oh, yeah. Anything. Right. Oh, and then you think [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2075.6s)]
*  about cannabis. Cannabis has its own discussion, its own effects, but very different system [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2080.16s)]
*  and tends to make people pretty happy with right where they are. The opioids tends to make people [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2085.12s)]
*  overly happy with right where they are. They tend to be a motivated, not motivated. So dopamine [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2090.0s)]
*  in this context, what happens is then dopamine drops below baseline after a drug or porn, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2095.8399999999997s)]
*  or even somebody's, let's say they make the huge mistake of like going outside their marriage or [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2101.92s)]
*  prostitute or something. It's the anticipation, the fear, the excitement, boom. Then it drops [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2107.84s)]
*  below baseline. And now here's the real rub in order to get back to baseline. Most people, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2112.0s)]
*  when they're in that trough, what do they do? They use more, but each time they use while they're in [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2118.4s)]
*  that trough, when dopamine is low, this is the key thing. When dopamine is low, no matter how much you [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2123.84s)]
*  do of that substance, no matter how much you engage in that behavior, that dopamine is going [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2129.84s)]
*  to have less and less of an effect. And it's not even going to get you above baseline. You have to [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2134.72s)]
*  wait. The period of abstinence is when these circuits return to normal. And with the exception [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2140.24s)]
*  of alcohol, where people can die from rapid withdrawal, this is why every addiction recovery [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2145.52s)]
*  program has a period of abstinence. They don't tell you to kind of taper off cocaine. They're [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2150.72s)]
*  like, listen, this has got to stop. And then when people relapse, the problem is they get, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2156.08s)]
*  you know, no pun intended, they get a bump, but that dopamine level is not where it used to be. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2161.2s)]
*  And they're constantly, quote unquote, chasing the dragon or whatever you want to call it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2167.52s)]
*  So, you know, these dopamine circuits evolved for a good reason to drive us toward adaptive [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2171.6s)]
*  behaviors. But listen, I have friends in the tech sector, in the finance sector, you see this in [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2176.16s)]
*  the finance guys. It's often science that they're doing Adderall, they're day trading, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2180.7999999999997s)]
*  they're night trading, you know, their friends are making a ton of money. And we also have the social [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2185.3599999999997s)]
*  comparison thing. So I'm not going to say that social media hijacks all of this, but let's just [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2188.72s)]
*  say, and I love social media. I'm on Instagram and X, I teach there, I learn there, love your [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2194.56s)]
*  content, love Cigurra's content, Rogan. You know, I'm learning there, Tim Dillon, right? Like I'm, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2199.6s)]
*  I love it. But there are elements of this where if you find yourself on social media, but you're [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2203.52s)]
*  kind of like, what am I doing here? Like this is like, nothing's happening here. You are in a [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2210.72s)]
*  dopamine trough. You're in a trough. So we've already gotten your high. You've gotten it and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2215.6s)]
*  we hear dopamine hits. If it were really dopamine hits, you'd be going, whoa, yeah, amazing. Cool. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2219.2s)]
*  No, that happens now and again. But what's happening is the threshold for what really draws you in is [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2224.88s)]
*  getting higher and higher. Which goes to show why when it comes sometimes to like sex addiction and [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  pornography addiction, that people's, what the kink that they need or the thing they need to see [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2235.12s)]
*  gets more out there because they have to just to even get back to the baseline, they have to, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2240.24s)]
*  they have, they've got to find more. They need a higher arc. Definitely. I had a couple of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2247.68s)]
*  questions. Sorry. No, no. And say where you're at. Can you, can you distill dopamine? Like is there, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2252.16s)]
*  is it manufacturable dopamine? There are things, yes. So there are things that are precursors to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2259.4399999999996s)]
*  dopamine and things that stimulate the release of dopamine. So things that stimulate the release [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2266.0s)]
*  of dopamine, the amino acid, L tyrosine. Okay. It's found in hard cheeses like Parmesan cheese, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2271.68s)]
*  believe it or not. Some people think they're a little bit addicted to cheese in some ways. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2278.96s)]
*  Oh, they do. Some people think that. Yeah. It's a L tyrosine as a supplement as well. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2282.96s)]
*  Tyrosine. He sounds like he's from Rome. There's a, there's a very interesting, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2288.08s)]
*  um, hairy little bean. No joke. This is a hairy little bean called mcuna purine. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2293.52s)]
*  Mcuna purines. Mcuna purines. Mcuna purines. This is a velvety bean. If you just put velvet bean [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2300.56s)]
*  L dopa, it is 99% L dopa, which is the precursor. It gets converted to dopamine. I'll take L8 ball [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2308.08s)]
*  of it. Remember that movie awakenings where people were frozen? Yes. With Robert De Niro. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2316.48s)]
*  That's right. And Robin Williams. Yes. Robin Williams. And they gave those patients, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2321.76s)]
*  it was a true story. It's based on a story by the neurologist writer, Oliver Sachs. And [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2326.1600000000003s)]
*  they gave those people L dopa. That velvety little bean is L dopa. So you say, can you [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2332.1600000000003s)]
*  manufacture it? You can take the thing that is the precursor. Now, if you do that, you'll feel [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2337.0400000000004s)]
*  dopaminergic as neuroscientists say, you'll be like buzzed, energized. That's Shakira. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2342.96s)]
*  Yeah. Absolutely. And then, and then you'll feel the drop. So, and then methamphetamine [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2349.52s)]
*  stimulates the release. As we saw cocaine stimulates release behaviors. Listen, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2356.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't want to demonize dopamine. No, not at all. Dopamine is, you know, I'm sure I had a surge of [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2359.84s)]
*  dopamine walking in here today. I'm a fan of your show. I had a surge of dopamine when I saw you. I [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2364.88s)]
*  was excited, nervous about it. And then it happened. And hopefully I will, the reward [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2368.6400000000003s)]
*  prediction error won't be less than you anticipate. That's my goal. So it's already fascinating. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2374.1600000000003s)]
*  So I think that, you know, can you manufacture it? Well, there are things that can stimulate [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2378.48s)]
*  its release. Now what's beautiful. What's really beautiful is when I usually, I think usually it [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2382.8s)]
*  happens when you're a teen for me, it was 19 when I discovered biology, you know, wasn't good at [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2388.72s)]
*  skateboarding, wasn't bad, but you know, I liked running and working out, but I never thought about [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2393.68s)]
*  becoming a professional athlete. And then I discovered learning and biology. And I thought, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2397.44s)]
*  wow, this is something that I'm highly motivated to do. I didn't really understand dopamine then. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2403.12s)]
*  We didn't know that much about it, but I'm motivated to do it. So there's dopamine from [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2408.0s)]
*  doing it. It brings me resources at first degrees and knowledge later, you know, the ability to buy [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2411.52s)]
*  a house, right? So much of my life is built around the work that I did like a maniac really, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2417.2s)]
*  between the age of 19 and I'm 49 now just working nonstop. And so there's functional dopamine and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2423.04s)]
*  pretty soon you start weaving it in like, Oh, I can also rest and have some recreation. And that's [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2428.96s)]
*  giving me dopamine. So our lives are built around this molecule we call dopamine. And so the way [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2432.88s)]
*  that you can manage it almost orchestrate dopamine to use it to your advantage. It's very usable. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2437.6s)]
*  That's right. I think the thing to remember the following dopamine is not about the [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2442.4s)]
*  pursuit of pleasure. It's about the pleasure of pursuit. It's about motivation. The other thing [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2448.56s)]
*  to remember about dopamine is it can, if it's increased very dramatically and very fast, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2454.7999999999997s)]
*  it can drive addiction. And I define addiction as a progressive narrowing of the things that [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2461.7599999999998s)]
*  bring you pleasure. A great life is where many, many things bring you pleasure. And then the, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2466.72s)]
*  perhaps the most important thing for people, especially if they're concerned about porn, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2471.2s)]
*  gambling, internet use, or whatever, even if they're not a full blown addict, they're just [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2475.04s)]
*  kind of feeling like a slave to everything going on that, you know, just everything, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2479.52s)]
*  highly processed foods, all of that is that any high amount of dopamine that comes to you without [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2484.72s)]
*  effort before it will eventually destroy you or bring you close to destruction. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2491.2s)]
*  So something that just feels so good that you, that all you had to do is open a package. All you [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2497.2799999999997s)]
*  had to do was take a pill or open a website or open a website. That is the slippery slope. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2501.52s)]
*  And if we think more in terms of, you know, yeah, Pandora's box doesn't really have a key on it. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2507.2s)]
*  Huh? Yeah. Like I'd listen, I'm not a huge UFC fan, but I'd, I've been to a few fights and it's fun [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2512.08s)]
*  and I see you guys down there in the front row and this kind of thing. Look, someday I imagine [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2517.2s)]
*  given my friend set and given my interests, maybe I'll just buy a ticket and it'd be a great thrill. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2521.52s)]
*  Right. But if I were a kid and I suddenly were just planted there every single night, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2526.16s)]
*  guess what you move one row back, it's going to feel like bad seating, you know? And it's, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  this is why the children of very wealthy people, unless your father is like a Warren Buffett, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2535.6s)]
*  who insists that you actually work in this kind of thing, that children of very wealthy people [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2541.04s)]
*  often destroy their lives. You know, they destroy their lives because they haven't had to work to [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2545.44s)]
*  have all this stuff. And there's this huge cushion below them. In fact, my graduate advisor, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2550.8s)]
*  they're almost swimming in dope and they're almost in the hot tub, but they never been in the pool. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2556.7200000000003s)]
*  And then they're exactly, and then they're, and then they're down below baseline. And then it [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2559.84s)]
*  takes more and more and more. That, you know, that show is that genetic and sorry to interrupt you, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2563.6s)]
*  but is that genetic that your baseline level for dopamine? Is that genetic? No, this is all [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2568.08s)]
*  behaviorally driven. And, you know, I'm not saying parents should, you said it's all [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2574.8s)]
*  behaviorally driven, all behaviorally. Yeah. Say if like you had a, like, you know, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2577.84s)]
*  your father was an addict or somebody, and then it could the, to the next generation [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2582.16s)]
*  have that same like need to get back to that baseline and it could be inherited type of thing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2585.84s)]
*  Well, okay. So there are certain addictions that appear to have some genetic component, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2590.0s)]
*  but it's confounded. As we say, it's mixed up with the behavioral stuff around that. Like for [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2596.7200000000003s)]
*  instance, the probability of somebody becoming a severe alcoholic, they now call it alcohol use [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2601.2s)]
*  disorder. And I'm not trying to be a reverent, but I just call it alcoholism. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2605.52s)]
*  going to, I'm going to try and stay out of the lanes of political correctness. Great. So the [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2611.3599999999997s)]
*  probability that somebody will become an alcoholic greatly increases if their first drink, just their [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2617.9199999999996s)]
*  first sip comes before age 13. Okay. Now some parents think, Hey, listen, if my kid has a beer [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2624.3199999999997s)]
*  when they're eight and 10, then they won't have this, you know, kind of mysterious feeling around [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2629.92s)]
*  alcohol. That's one theory, but we know on good statistics that drinking before the age of 13 [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  greatly increases the probability of becoming an alcoholic. So now you can imagine in what households [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2640.16s)]
*  will that happen? Well, where they're trying to normalize high alcohol intake. So it can be both [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2644.56s)]
*  genetic and circumstantial, but do some countries in suffer with the higher alcoholism rates then? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2648.88s)]
*  Yes. Even European ones. Northern European countries, especially in the winter. I have [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2654.56s)]
*  Northern European relatives. I'll tell you in the winter, uh, they can drink up there and it's dark [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2657.84s)]
*  and, and, you know, alcohol is a depressant. There's also about 8% of people have a gene variant that [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2662.56s)]
*  when they drink, they don't feel the same sedative type quality to alcohol. When you drink, the first [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2669.1200000000003s)]
*  thing that happens for everybody is your prefrontal cortex. This is like the part of your brain right [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2676.1600000000003s)]
*  behind your forehead. It's the part that sets context, like what's, what's appropriate in [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2680.0s)]
*  different places. It inhibits you. Everybody gets a little more talkative, right? Everyone's talking, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2684.8s)]
*  talk, talk, but then you drink more and people are starting to pass out on the couch and people are [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2689.92s)]
*  slurring their words. About 8% of people get a dopamine surge and an energy increase from alcohol [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2693.76s)]
*  with increasing alcohol intake. These are the people remember, um, oh, so in your twenties [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2700.5600000000004s)]
*  and there's that guy and he's still awake at like three in the morning. He's in the kitchen and he's [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2705.36s)]
*  bumping around in the cupboard and you see him the next morning. Yeah. And he's like, Hey, and you're [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2708.8s)]
*  like, we were passed out, blacked out, drunk. He's doing laundry or whatever. He's just like, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2713.36s)]
*  Hey, let's go running. Yeah. He's doing, yeah. You make it a lemonade or whatever. That's a [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2718.32s)]
*  genetic predisposition. Wow. And so, but is that a positive one? It sounds like it is kind of, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2722.32s)]
*  well, it's probably adaptive in some, you know, they've got, you got the cursor on Russia. I mean, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2727.76s)]
*  listen, I'm friends with Lex Friedman. I mean, that kid can drink compared to me. Oh, dude, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2732.96s)]
*  yeah, he does. I don't drink. I had my last sip in 2019. Hey man. Well, and let's have the depression [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2736.88s)]
*  to show it, man. He's got that emo side of that takes over him. You know, he's definitely, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2741.92s)]
*  I think he just put something out again on X. I mean, it's perfect. No, I love Lex cause he, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2745.28s)]
*  there's this transparency about him to me that is remarkably human, you know, like this, like ever [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2750.16s)]
*  hopeful, talented, but also very like honest. He's just so, he just said, I'm an introvert who hides [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2758.7200000000003s)]
*  in the world often way too much. One thing I wish I did more is call and text my friends. I think [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2765.04s)]
*  about them often and feel lucky to know them, but experience a strange anxiety that prevents me from [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2769.04s)]
*  texting and calling silly introvert. Introvert brain wants to pull me into isolation and darkness. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2773.2s)]
*  Then again, once I hang out with said friends, it's like, we've been talking every day, so maybe [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2779.04s)]
*  there's no problem. And it's just how dude friendships are. BSC thoughts brought to you by brain on six [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2782.8s)]
*  shots. That's perfect. And I, you know, with luck, you know, I won't claim that he posted that cause [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2788.0s)]
*  of me, but I'd been texting for like three weeks now and it's just crickets. And then I'll get [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2794.56s)]
*  something back that just says here. And you just learn with him over time. That's just, you know, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2799.28s)]
*  that's just that. That's Russian communication. I mean, it can take five generations to get a hug [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2805.2000000000003s)]
*  out of somebody, you know, it's like, Oh, they're unbelievable. And they, you know, a lot of them had [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2809.76s)]
*  carried stone dolls as children. Like imagine if your doll, your baby doll is made of stone. It's [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2814.0s)]
*  like that's your whole concept of the world is going to be so different. Bring up stone dolls, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2818.2400000000002s)]
*  bring back that chart up again. I want to see what they were doing over there. Alcoholism by [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2822.16s)]
*  country. Um, United States, 13.9%. Um, Canada only 8% UK 8.7. And what's the darkest one over there? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2826.3199999999997s)]
*  It's Russian. What's it at 20.9% hell yeah. Oh yeah. You gotta be fucking brain dead. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2838.3999999999996s)]
*  North Korea is lowest, but, but we don't really know what's going on. And no, we don't know. This [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2844.48s)]
*  is just a fun chart, but it's also exciting to just make just one place I never want to visit. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2848.24s)]
*  Be reminded that the Russians live like that. I want to ask you about this, about, um, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2853.12s)]
*  so one of the big things that I think is a huge problem that's about to happen in the world is, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2858.24s)]
*  um, uh, pornography addiction, right? I think it's, I believe it's humongous. I believe it's [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2864.08s)]
*  bigger than alcoholism. I believe it's like the wave of it that we're, we're starting to see like [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2870.16s)]
*  people really suffering from it. I think it's one of the reasons why there's a lot of divorce. Um, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2875.28s)]
*  what do you see like neuroscientifically, uh, about how we can, how people can start to manage [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2881.6000000000004s)]
*  that. And then even as what you just talked about about dopamine, it's like, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's helping people realize with that, that it's like such a hole that you're getting into. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2892.5600000000004s)]
*  No, uh, no, whatever that thing is called, no pun intended. Um, how does that, how can people [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2896.88s)]
*  start to cut that off for themselves? Is there anything they can do manage like, or do they have [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2904.56s)]
*  to get help if they believe that they're suffering from like pornography or, uh, sexual addiction? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2908.96s)]
*  Yeah. Uh, super important questions. Um, so glad you're raising this because, you know, it's, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2914.88s)]
*  it's interesting if you look at the research on pornography and sexual behavior generally, right? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2920.4s)]
*  What you'll find mostly in the academic studies of those areas is kind of an attempt to normalize [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2927.6s)]
*  a lot of behavior. There are reasons for that. Some pseudo political, some, um, just kind of the way [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2934.72s)]
*  those studies were done for a long time, but it's really important to emphasize that it takes a [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2940.48s)]
*  while for science to catch up to culture. Okay. It takes a while for science to catch up to culture. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2945.36s)]
*  Yeah. And the reason is not because scientists are lazier. They're uninterested is that doing science [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2950.2400000000002s)]
*  well takes a long time. Look, I've run studies in my lab on animals, on humans, clinical trials. It [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2955.28s)]
*  takes a long time, like three, four years sometimes to get real information, to get a really good [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2961.04s)]
*  study done. Meanwhile, life is happening. And in the last, in the last five years, especially, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2966.16s)]
*  there's been an exponential growth of the amount of pornography available online, the different [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2972.88s)]
*  formats, right? Only fans, um, you know, all the different sites that people can go to free, AI, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2978.08s)]
*  and within each of those, there's also been a huge amplification of the, of what's called like [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2986.32s)]
*  high intensity porn. What's high intensity porn. It's more than two people. It's, um, BDSM. Now BDSM [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2990.88s)]
*  is its own discussion that maybe we could talk about at some point, you know, just separately [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=2997.36s)]
*  about this merge of pain and pleasure that the reason I'll just, the punchline, um, is that [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3000.96s)]
*  dopamine is also increased by what we call the cessation of pain. When pain starts and then stops, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3008.1600000000003s)]
*  you get an amplified dopamine surge. So a lot of people are watching or engaging in what we [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3014.4s)]
*  would call violent porn, right? And we're as primate species, humans, we have an empathy. So [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3020.56s)]
*  when people are watching pornography, they're obviously not experiencing the same things, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3026.72s)]
*  exactly those people are doing and experiencing, but they're tuning into it, right? They're getting [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3030.7999999999997s)]
*  to it. And we can only speculate as to what they're doing to themselves, right? Typically, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3035.52s)]
*  when we're talking about porn, let's just be direct that we're also talking about masturbation, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3039.12s)]
*  right? Typically, when we're talking about watching video porn, sometimes it's women, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3042.56s)]
*  most often it's men by a huge majority. Oh yeah, the men are the one watching it. Yeah. Although, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3047.28s)]
*  you know, years ago I had a girlfriend, a woman I was dating very seriously and she confessed to me [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3052.6400000000003s)]
*  that prior to our relationship, she had developed a porn compulsion. It wasn't an addiction. Um, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3057.84s)]
*  you know, addiction again, is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3063.6000000000004s)]
*  It hadn't taken her to the point where it was destructive, but she had the wisdom to cut herself [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3067.0400000000004s)]
*  off from it early on. Okay. So it does happen with women, but it's much more frequent with men. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3072.0s)]
*  So here's the thing. We can think of pornography now as like the methamphetamine of pornography [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3076.88s)]
*  compared to the pornography of, you know, we always hear about, oh, you know, like when I was [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3084.96s)]
*  growing up, the playboy or, you know, that, the thing when I was a kid, like I'll confess this, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3088.4s)]
*  first didn't know I was going to do a confession, but they had those like, um, sex education books [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3093.12s)]
*  where they were like sketch drawings and pencil. Oh yeah. Bring them up. You know, when I was, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3097.44s)]
*  you know, probably 14, 13, I was like, this is awesome. Yeah. You know, this was awesome, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3101.84s)]
*  but it was about, you know, teaching you basically about sex. It was teaching about body parts. And [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3107.6000000000004s)]
*  that was, you know, pencil drawings. I can't believe we're looking this up. No, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3114.08s)]
*  it's interesting because I think a lot of people, if you do a pencil drawings, uh, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3118.48s)]
*  who knows what kind of freaky stuff's gonna jump up here. No, we have a blocker on. I'm pretty [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3123.6000000000004s)]
*  sure. Yeah, there we go. There we go. So yeah, see human loving. This is very different than [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3127.52s)]
*  today's porn. Sex and Hugh. I love how they used to call it human loving. That's nice though. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3134.96s)]
*  There's something at least it makes more sense. It puts even your head into something, you know, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3140.32s)]
*  instead of like a Brittany's butt world or whatever, you know, which takes it to a whole [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3145.2s)]
*  different deal. And there was no discussion whatsoever of elements of pain or BDSM or power [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3149.68s)]
*  play. There you go. You know, yeah. I mean, you know, God, for a heterosexual young male, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3154.16s)]
*  the fact that they put her naked facing us as opposed to the guy on the other side, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3160.24s)]
*  you're like, okay, cool. But you know, the other thing about pornography is that it, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3164.0s)]
*  in a young brain, this, this is very important. It relates to everything we're talking about today [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3168.8799999999997s)]
*  from about age zero to 25, your brain is incredibly plastic. It's modified by experience [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3173.2799999999997s)]
*  just by being in those experiences. When you say plastic, you mean it's more like it's not [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3179.44s)]
*  solid yet? That's right. You can literally wire neurons, plasticity, wire neurons, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3183.52s)]
*  stother neurons very readily. I mean, this was known for a long time, but it was really [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3188.08s)]
*  formalized by my scientific great grandparents, David Hubel and Torrance and Weasel. They won a [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3192.48s)]
*  Nobel prize for showing that if you take it a cat, a monkey or a kid, and you close one eyelid for [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3196.56s)]
*  just a few hours each day, the brain becomes blind to visual input through that eye. Once you [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3204.64s)]
*  open the eye up, unless you do something else, like close the other eye in order to reverse [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3210.72s)]
*  that plasticity. However, if today I just say, yeah, that's how fast and permanent it is, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3215.2s)]
*  unless you do something to reverse it. But if I did that same thing to you now or me now, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3219.8399999999997s)]
*  there'd be no brain change. You close your eye. Obviously you can't see through a closed eye, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3224.56s)]
*  pop open the eyelid later. You see just fine. So we know that from a, until about age 25, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  the brain just modifies itself based on experience. So if you're doing cocaine, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3233.2s)]
*  amphetamine, or let's just stay with this example, you're watching high intensity, violent porn [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3238.08s)]
*  with more than two people, right? You know, we forget that every time you add another person, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3243.04s)]
*  you have it's two women and one guy or it's, you know, what's this woman on X? I mean, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3247.2799999999997s)]
*  I have to say it makes, it gives me an aversive response, which I think is the healthy response. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3251.6s)]
*  Every time she announces, I think she's like sleeping with a hundred and then a thousand [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3257.52s)]
*  people. And listen, she's obviously in control of her own life. Western conference right now. I [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3261.6s)]
*  think I saw the other day, I don't know what it Barbara. Is it Barbara blues? Bonnie blue, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3265.8399999999997s)]
*  body blue. Yeah. I mean, this is like, this is like methamphetamine with heroin and you know, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3270.72s)]
*  what you get the picture is starting to layer in all these different things. And so the young, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3276.0s)]
*  you think about the young male brain in particular, young female brain watching this stuff. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3282.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's not just setting a behavioral expectation because we always hear about that. You know, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3287.2s)]
*  they think sex is like that and it's not, it's setting this incredibly high threshold for what [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3291.04s)]
*  they consider stimulated, not just stimulating sexually, but stimulating mentally. I mean, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3297.12s)]
*  it's crazy. It's like, you know, listen, I like playing cards every once in a while. So you go [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3303.12s)]
*  play a card game with your friends. Be like the first time you play cards, you got a million bucks, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3307.12s)]
*  you know, you're, or you're back there in the high state. You're in like the Dana white room, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3313.52s)]
*  right? Like, I know it, like when I see sometimes his gambling hands, right? He's, you know, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3317.04s)]
*  it's wild, but he can afford to play. Right. And he also knows where that fits into the rest of [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3320.48s)]
*  his life. But you think about a kid, you know, you have a chance to win a, you know, a million [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3326.0s)]
*  dollars. Actually, there's this scene in that movie, that show, remember succession? Yes. A show that [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3331.52s)]
*  it's all about dopamine, this family of rich brats who are completely corrupt. Everything's about [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3337.52s)]
*  more, more, more dopamine has been called in a book. I forget the author, the molecule of more. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3343.12s)]
*  It's all about wanting more. And there's this dreadfully sad scene where they go out to play, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3348.64s)]
*  I think it was like a baseball game or something. And they bring their, their garden help and they [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3353.6s)]
*  take the kid and they say, Hey, if you can hit a home run, these people's kids, people are clearly, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3358.48s)]
*  and they say, if you hit a home run, you have a million dollars. And you see the anticipation, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3363.2s)]
*  this would transform these kids and their parents' life. And then he doesn't get the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3366.7999999999997s)]
*  million dollars. And they give them like some watch that's probably worth $25,000. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3371.52s)]
*  This is dopamine reward prediction error in a, in a nutshell, had they given him the watch, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3377.04s)]
*  the family probably would have been pretty thrilled. They could sell it. They could use it. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3382.88s)]
*  Had they not been involved in the game, their dopamine is the same as when they go home at [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3386.4s)]
*  night, but they had a chance at a million dollars. And when they didn't get that, it drops them below [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3390.96s)]
*  baseline. And then you see the kid that evening, like sitting around his apartment, just completely [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3397.6s)]
*  despondent with the watch sitting there as if it was worth nothing. That's dopamine. And when you [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3402.48s)]
*  think about pornography, that's what young people are being exposed to. So therefore sexual experiences [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3408.0s)]
*  not only are quite different. Remember pornography is about, obviously people are getting aroused by [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3414.4s)]
*  watching other people have sex. And, you know, I don't know what kind of sex people are having out [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3421.44s)]
*  there, but in my experience, you know, the whole, the whole business of sex and learning how to have [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3425.6s)]
*  great sex is about learning to be in the, in the experience with somebody. And it's a communication. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3429.8399999999997s)]
*  It's an ongoing communication. And it's about being in the experience, being present, not watching [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3435.04s)]
*  someone else have sex. Oh yeah. I was thinking the other day, watching some other dude, like have sex [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3440.16s)]
*  with a woman. It's kind of, I don't even know if it's home or erotic. I don't know what it is. It's [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3446.3199999999997s)]
*  definitely, when you really, when you take a step back from it, it's a little bizarre. It's [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3450.88s)]
*  definitely intrusive, right? But for surely it alters the way that you think about things. I mean, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3455.28s)]
*  I know in my own life, I got exposed to pornography real early. I would bike across town and get a [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3460.08s)]
*  little look at some pornos. Perfectly normal behavior for a young male. Pretty normal. I was [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3464.6400000000003s)]
*  breaking into houses to frickin, you know, get that. I have friends like you growing up. Where did you [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3468.8s)]
*  grow up? Louisiana. I had friends growing up. I mean, in the, in South, South Bay Palo Alto was [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3474.1600000000003s)]
*  pretty tame. But when we, when I started getting into the skateboard thing, you know, we drew from [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3479.2s)]
*  kids from all over and listen, I'm very grateful for that early exposure. Oh yeah. It's easy to [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3483.04s)]
*  jerk off to if you've got some good graffiti. Oh no, I meant early exposure to kids that from [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3487.2s)]
*  all walks of life. But I knew kids like you breaking into houses. Oh dude. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. It [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3490.72s)]
*  would be crazy. You would like, you know, yeah, just like breaking in and just like, yeah, we made [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3494.56s)]
*  some poor choices. But I think the fact that, um, here's one thing I noticed for myself, right? So [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3499.68s)]
*  well, I had like a lot of distance, like I had kind of a disorder, I guess, where like I had some [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3507.2s)]
*  intimacy issues where I couldn't, um, I'd had like some issues like just like probably with my mom [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3512.08s)]
*  from growing up of not having a connection. And so if a woman, if I got around a woman, I got very [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3518.3999999999996s)]
*  nervous, right? It was like a very extremely nervous, right? So I think it made it like, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3523.52s)]
*  once I saw pornography, I was like, okay, well here's a way that I can be near a woman [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3530.3999999999996s)]
*  or near as a female where I can, uh, have some form of intimacy without having to have a real [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3534.7999999999997s)]
*  person there. So that for one, for me was, um, it was okay. It made sense that, that that's how I [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3542.3199999999997s)]
*  adapted to it as a kid or how I understood it as a kid. It makes sense. Uh, but as an adult, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3548.7999999999997s)]
*  it didn't help me at a certain point. Um, and then the secondary part for me was, uh, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3553.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, you would just see, you would see sex like an images or scenes or a way a camera's set [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3559.52s)]
*  up. And so then that's how you start to think of it, of intimacy. It's like, you know, it's like, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3564.7200000000003s)]
*  okay, well we have to do this scene. You know, it's not like you would stage things around your room [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3570.88s)]
*  or anything. You didn't have any cameras or anything, but you would just like, you thought [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3574.4s)]
*  of each thing as like a scene or a scenario. So, um, yeah, you're not out there shooting baskets. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3577.92s)]
*  You're trying to like recreate the NBA final, you know, right? You're, and that's a lot, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3583.52s)]
*  that's a lot of pressure. So it was a ton of pressure. So it was like, and you almost couldn't [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3587.76s)]
*  even, yeah, there was no real connection. So that for me was a real cul-de-sac of like trying to [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3592.6400000000003s)]
*  figure out how to evolve like, um, intimately, you know, and, and, and it's, it's some of that's [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3599.44s)]
*  taken a long time to get through and different like, uh, class, not classes, but like ayahuasca [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3606.4s)]
*  really helped me a lot. Different medicines helped a lot with like just unbinding all that anxiety [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3613.52s)]
*  that was just like this young person who just, uh, didn't know how to relate to females, you know? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3619.84s)]
*  You know, so I've been speaking recently about MoonPay and what it is and what it ain't baby, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3626.0s)]
*  because you know, I've, I've had that, I've been, I've had one foot in crypto and one foot out over [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3630.32s)]
*  the years. I'm walking that line, you know, but I'm not going to stop telling you about MoonPay [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3634.8s)]
*  because it's where I'm at now. It's what's brought me back into the crypto game. MoonPay powers the [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3639.68s)]
*  entire world of crypto. Some people say they are the PayPal of crypto. Seriously, nearly every [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3646.3199999999997s)]

*  lose your investment. MoonPay is a tool to facilitate your transactions, not a source [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3696.24s)]

*  slept with this other guy. All I knew about him was he was like some buff football player. I'm like [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3876.48s)]
*  the skinny skateboard kid. Oh dude, my first girlfriend slept with a dude before me who wore a [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3880.48s)]
*  cape. Dude, a fucking. You wore a cape? Yeah. Like fuck dude. What the heck? Yeah. Listen, I mean, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3885.04s)]
*  I remember going into that like any young male thinking like, my goodness, you know, this is like, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3894.32s)]
*  is a lot of pressure. And one of the things I'm so grateful to her for is, you know, we were able to [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3900.72s)]
*  talk a bit at first. No, you know, it was just like, you're just wanting to go perfect, right? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3908.96s)]
*  You just wanted to go perfect. And I will say one of the huge mistakes people make, maybe we can save [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3913.6s)]
*  some people, some men and women, young, young men and women, some serious stress. One of the huge [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3918.08s)]
*  mistakes people make is to try and take that edge off with alcohol. First of all, it starts to really [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3923.52s)]
*  muddy all the consent stuff. So you're already like, you're already playing with fire, right? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3929.52s)]
*  Because, you know, when people are inebriated, there's all they're not in their right mind. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3934.56s)]
*  Yeah. So the other thing is that by chemically removing that stress, you, many people come to [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3938.72s)]
*  depend on those chemicals to relax and they don't learn the skills. Right. As I always joke, you [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3947.44s)]
*  know, now it's not a joke. It's serious. You know, nowadays, like every young male who wants to like [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3952.7999999999997s)]
*  get a little bit, you know, jacked is like, should I take TRT? And I'm like, dude, you're 25. You're [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3956.72s)]
*  already filled with testosterone. They're like, yeah, but you know, and you're like, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3962.48s)]
*  learn how to train, learn how to eat. And when you're in your late forties, talk to a doctor, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3966.4s)]
*  freeze some sperm, cause it's going to shut down your sperm production. Maybe then, but like [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3970.64s)]
*  just chill. And in the same way, it's like, I think there's immense pressure. There's also something [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3974.48s)]
*  that's happening now that I hear about a lot, which is from the beginning of time, women have [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3978.96s)]
*  talked to one another. Okay. I had the chatty Cathy, you heard of that term? Is that what it's [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3984.72s)]
*  called? It's a famous term. Who brought it up? I'm going to get to the bottom of that term really [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3990.96s)]
*  quick because people have heard it a lot and you don't know where it really started. Do we know that [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3994.88s)]
*  the phrase chatty Cathy originally came from the name of popular talking doll manufactured by Mattel [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=3999.52s)]
*  in the 1960s. The doll's pull string mechanism played prerecorded phrases when the string was [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4004.4s)]
*  activated, like you don't make any money or you get your own dinner. I made those up, but damn [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4010.08s)]
*  Cathy's a vibe. Look at her. She had buck tooth, a little buck tooth there. Yeah. Back when you get [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4017.52s)]
*  a good British gal, but go on. Was there anything left on that information? Over time, the term [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4022.08s)]
*  chatty Cathy became a common idiom to describe someone who is especially talkative. And I'm just [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4026.72s)]
*  joking ladies, but, but that's interesting where that came from. I never knew, always heard that. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4031.7599999999998s)]
*  I never heard that term. You know, so I had the great benefit and the disadvantage as well of [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4035.28s)]
*  having a sister, right? Having a sister is great because you don't think women are weird. Like I [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4042.16s)]
*  grew up with a girl living next door to me and my sister, we shared a bathroom, all that. But I also [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4046.64s)]
*  heard the way her and her friends talk about boys. And so from a young age, I was like, man, I can't [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4052.0s)]
*  make a mistake on a first date. I got to do everything perfect because it's going to be the [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4057.3599999999997s)]
*  rundown. But back then there was no social media. Now young guys tell me they are terrified to go [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4062.3199999999997s)]
*  out on dates because let's say they do something wrong. Let's say they're less than perfect. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4070.7999999999997s)]
*  They are very concerned. It's going to end up on some site and they're going to be shamed. And I'll [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4076.72s)]
*  tell you, I do think, and of course I take the male perspective because that's the only body I've [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4080.48s)]
*  ever lived in. But I do think that a lot of the complaints about, you know, young, you know, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4084.48s)]
*  there are no men today, young, young males, like in the twenties and thirties, you know, a lot of [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4091.04s)]
*  these guys are terrified because they feel like everything's potentially going to become public, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4095.68s)]
*  positive or negative. And I hear a lot from young males about the pornography question, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4100.5599999999995s)]
*  about all this. And I like, there's one kid that I've kind of mentored over time. I know [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4105.2s)]
*  since he was a little kid and now he's in his twenties and he's doing great in life, but he's [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4108.88s)]
*  had his, um, his challenges and he, I'll tell you, it's really interesting. He said to me, he goes, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4112.8s)]
*  look, you know, it's hard, good looking kid. He's working right now. He's working construction. He's [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4120.08s)]
*  doing great. And he said, look, it's hard to find someone who just kind of want to keep your [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4125.12s)]
*  relationship. Just the two of it. Yeah. But he did. He, he had a girlfriend and she wasn't the one. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4130.08s)]
*  So he found one and they have a closed container. They call it, you know, there's like the new, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4134.56s)]
*  new language or something. And he's like, man, it's awesome. And he's like, you know, if I'm [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4139.52s)]
*  nervous about something related to intimacy, we talk about it. It turns out she's nervous too. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4144.96s)]
*  And he feels super safe. And, but he had to literally ante that up because where he went [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4149.200000000001s)]
*  to school, I won't say where he went to school because he'll murder, he'll murder me. But you [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4155.280000000001s)]
*  know, it's, it's like the opposite Arizona state, right? Cause there, there's all this stuff about [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4159.52s)]
*  people talking behind the scenes and then posting it to the internet. And that's enough. And so that [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4164.24s)]
*  drives guys more into the, the loneliness and isolation of porn and substance abuse. And so [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4168.08s)]
*  I'm not blaming women here. I'm not blaming men here. I'm just saying that when it comes to intimacy, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4174.88s)]
*  everybody's nervous about that. Right? When I was a kid, there was like Dr. Ruth and there were those [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4179.44s)]
*  books. And then you had this thing called experience and you'd have to, well, that went less well, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4183.36s)]
*  that went really well. And then over time you learn how to have the communication and enjoy [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4188.08s)]
*  yourself in it. But it's hard. It's difficult. Now you can have a thing where it's like, say you [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4193.52s)]
*  go out on a date with a girl and then they could make a video like, Oh, this guy tried to kiss me. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4198.4800000000005s)]
*  What a lose. Just like, but I guess guys could do that too, but just, just the risk of that on [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4203.040000000001s)]
*  either side. It's like, then that wins, you know, it's like, how many times are we going to let [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4208.400000000001s)]
*  technology defeat what just means being human. Right. And like, and at what point do we start [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4215.120000000001s)]
*  to choose like, Hey, I want to make a moral, like a choice for myself and whoever I'm going to date [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4222.64s)]
*  with, maybe I have a talk with them first or something like, you know, but it's like every [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4226.72s)]
*  time it's like technology is the one that seems like take away like things that used to be so real [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4231.280000000001s)]
*  to us. Yeah. Because then you're both in a cave. You're both just masturbating or whatever. And [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4237.12s)]
*  you're both like brokenhearted in a, in some semblance. It seems like, is that crazy to say [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4241.12s)]
*  that? No, I don't think so at all. I mean, listen, text messages. I hate telling people this, but like [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4245.360000000001s)]
*  everything you text is potentially public. I don't care if you're a public facing AKA famous person [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4251.2s)]
*  or not. And that terrifies people at the same time, you know, there can be great intimacy [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4256.16s)]
*  through writing. You know, my first girlfriend, I wrote each other letters for years, for years. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4261.5199999999995s)]
*  I still have letters from girlfriends. You know, I cherish those. I don't break them out too often. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4266.0s)]
*  If you have a new girlfriend, you basically, you got to hide those away pretty carefully, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4270.5599999999995s)]
*  but I assume anyone I dates got those, you know, from their former relationships and I'm not [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4273.12s)]
*  bothered by that. I mean, that's part of the experience. You go get them out, but I agree, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4277.84s)]
*  man. I get nervous because sometimes like for a date or something I would like to do, well, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4281.04s)]
*  let's do a zoom call or something first, because it's like, you know, especially if we live a [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4286.24s)]
*  little bit away from each other, let's see if we even talk well or something. But then you're [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4291.28s)]
*  worried like, well, is somebody recording this or what's going on? Yes. But then it's like, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4294.32s)]
*  yeah, I'm just kidding. I mean, listen, well, the old stereotype was girls feared getting slut [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4297.92s)]
*  shamed. Right. Guys feared getting dork shamed, like loser shamed. Yeah. Right. Big, you know, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4304.8s)]
*  that it's been said by the evolutionary biologist. Donny's a loser, dude. And they speculate a lot, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4311.84s)]
*  but the evolutionary biologists will say, you know, a woman's greatest fear is violence from a man. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4317.84s)]
*  Man's greatest fear is being laughed at by a woman. Right. And you're right. Exactly. And so [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4324.16s)]
*  there's this battle nowadays. I'm glad we're talking about this because there's this kind of [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4330.4800000000005s)]
*  unspoken battle between the masculine and feminine forces. Well, it's just funny. You say that [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4333.92s)]
*  because I just realized that the majority of my childhood was some woman. I don't even know who [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4337.76s)]
*  it was laughing in the distance in my head. Oh man. Well, and like, especially when I got in [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4342.0s)]
*  the pervert and that kind of time of time. But well, and there's nothing that feels better than, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4346.8s)]
*  you know, feeling like you can deeply satisfy your partner and they're devoted to you and [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4351.4400000000005s)]
*  you're devoted to them. It's a wonderful, I mean, that's the stuff that, you know, love and marriages [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4355.52s)]
*  and families and to be direct, great sex are made of. Right. But this is one of the most important [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4359.28s)]
*  conversations to our audience because I think this is the thing that's it's killed, you know, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4364.8s)]
*  relationships are falling up. It's like, if we don't, if this doesn't get fixed now, it's going to be, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4369.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's, you know, societies can change and end really fast, especially with like, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4375.04s)]
*  technology now. To me, it's, it's just like, we're at a crucial moment for relationships. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4380.88s)]
*  I totally agree. I mean, you know, young guys approach me a lot about the porn thing, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4387.68s)]
*  about concern about like, are they going to be shamed on one of these sites if they, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4391.280000000001s)]
*  you know, do something wrong or, and I'm not talking about like wrong, like they were forceful. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4395.04s)]
*  I'm talking about wrong. Like they, they made a mistake. Yeah. They said something dumb or, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4399.76s)]
*  you know, I think a lot of one, Nick, didn't you have a site you're pulling up? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4403.84s)]
*  This is one right here. Are we dating the same guy? Women turn to Facebook to uncover cheating [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4406.96s)]
*  and violence. Experts say use of groups to warn others about dangerous men is indictment on [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4411.12s)]
*  government's failure to keep women safe. This is from the guardian. So it's obviously very pro [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4416.8s)]
*  the groups, but there's negative consequences, like people being reported just for dating multiple [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4421.76s)]
*  women that they're not exclusive with and stuff like that. But it's also, it's very pro who you [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4426.4800000000005s)]
*  said the guardian is very pro the app as like an empowerment for women, the way they can stay safe. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4430.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think apps that protect people against violence are great. I think that, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4435.84s)]
*  you know, if you look at the data on infidelity in and out of marriage, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4441.2s)]
*  it's equally distributed between men and women. Okay. So there's no, there's no men cheat more [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4445.04s)]
*  than women. It's, it's, it's clearly equally distributed. So the data play that over and [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4450.48s)]
*  over again, you look at divorce data, but you just look at self-report data, all different forms of [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4455.76s)]
*  data collection that really orient towards honesty. Cause people lie all the time and [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4459.44s)]
*  studies and statistics point to that. I think that, you know, the most important thing really, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4464.48s)]
*  if we're talking about forming intimacy, whether or not sexual intimacy, emotional intimacy, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4471.52s)]
*  or both is that people feel that their communications are vaulted between them. Right. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4475.6s)]
*  What does it mean? It means it's just between them. What happened, what, what, what's exchanged [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4481.360000000001s)]
*  between them stays, stays between them. That's intimacy in its own right. Is that it's something [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4486.0s)]
*  here. It's, it's between us. Right. Right. I mean, I, you know, I have a half joking solution to this, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4490.240000000001s)]
*  but I'm only half joking. Oh yeah, for sure. And I should say I've had some [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4497.28s)]
*  great relationships and I've had some not great relationships, right. I'm on great terms with [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4503.04s)]
*  most all of my ex girlfriends, you know, and I'm so grateful to, especially one from about, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4508.32s)]
*  it was a long relationship, about seven years where she really taught me how to like have the [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4516.4s)]
*  uncomfortable conversation. Wow. And I'm still learning. Right. And we're still good friends, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4521.2s)]
*  but I'll tell you one of the solutions to this. Men find a good lesbian friend. You want to really [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4527.04s)]
*  understand where you're strong, where you're weak. And you want to learn to just kind of relax around [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4536.4s)]
*  women, be around a woman that you have no chance of sleeping with. That buddy oyster. You know, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4541.44s)]
*  I have a couple of lesbian friends and I'll tell you, I've always had a couple of lesbian friends. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4546.72s)]
*  I'm convinced lesbians are going to save us all. God, I got to get one. They are, you know, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4550.56s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? And you got to get it out of your head that you're going to sleep with them. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4554.64s)]
*  Yes. Cause these are what we call platinum star lesbians. They are interested in women and women. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4558.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. I'm talking some chicken a Westbrook Jersey. So, and they, it's interesting because [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4561.280000000001s)]
*  they have an amazing perspective on men. That's from a women's perspective. And they also have [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4566.4800000000005s)]
*  an amazing perspective on women. They can say things like she's crazy. Andrew, you date her, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4571.360000000001s)]
*  you're going to be in pain. And they can also say things like she seems pretty cool. I would date [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4578.64s)]
*  her except she's not into women. And you, that's good. Women can see things in women that men can't [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4582.88s)]
*  see. Men can see things in men that obviously women can't see. I mean, I grew up in a big pack [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4588.0s)]
*  of guys. Like I only hit bull's eyes when it comes to assessment of friends and business partners, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4592.240000000001s)]
*  men and women. But you know, with men, I can just tell he's a sociopath. He's cool. He's not cool. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4598.72s)]
*  I can just tell it's like a six cents. The other thing, you know, across the sexes, you know, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4603.12s)]
*  a macaque monkey blindfolded on LSD has better optics. And I don't think I'm alone in that. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4610.08s)]
*  Right. Cause we get stirred. It's not all about the anticipation of sex. It's that the styles [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4616.16s)]
*  of communication are different. The way that stories and information is turned into things [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4620.96s)]
*  by one sex and it's like a whole different world. Lesbians normalize all of this and they're [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4624.64s)]
*  extremely direct. And some of my best friends are lesbians. I love them to death. I would, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4630.96s)]
*  we got to get some damn lesbians over here. Lesbians are going to save us all. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4636.64s)]
*  Yeah, I love that. That would be a great musical. Lesbians are going to save us all. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4639.76s)]
*  And I believe that I would love to see that. And I think that, yeah, I think there is this, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4644.72s)]
*  you know, for a while there, people were like gays and gays and you know, don't be gay and that [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4651.6s)]
*  kind of stuff. Probably like 50 years ago, that was like a thing, you know? And then, but now I [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4657.76s)]
*  think one of the neat things about gay folks is there are that they have like a special recipe, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4663.52s)]
*  you know, that's built into them. Like I have a good friend I've known since childhood. It was [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4671.84s)]
*  wild because he basically slept with like more women than any of us in high school. He's a gay [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4676.08s)]
*  gentleman. He ended up being gay. Went off to college. He's as gay as could be. And, you know, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4680.08s)]
*  and the communication, he's explained like the communication in the gay community, gay male [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4686.88s)]
*  community. Well, it's just very direct. People ask for sex if they want, they say no if they [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4690.72s)]
*  don't want to. Want lunch, want to come. That's it. Straight up. I mean, the stereotype is it [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4695.28s)]
*  matches, there are some married gay couples, obviously monogamous, et cetera, but it aligns [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4701.28s)]
*  with all the male stereotypes of promiscuous multiple partners. That's the kind of stereotype, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4705.84s)]
*  right? You know, the grill and come, that'd be my team, dude. If you had a gay flag football team [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4712.72s)]
*  in college, dude, for the, at the rec center, grill and come. You want to hear some wild data [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4719.84s)]
*  on homosexuality and hormones? Okay. So years ago, when I was a graduate student at Berkeley, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4728.320000000001s)]
*  I was part of a study. I wasn't the main author that looked at finger length ratios [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4732.8s)]
*  and homosexuality in men and women and how much testosterone was in utero. Now I don't want anyone [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4737.6s)]
*  to freak out and just start staring at their fingers, but because it has to be measured [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4744.16s)]
*  correctly. All right. All right. So, so if you hold, if you hold up your right hand, like I'm [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4748.400000000001s)]
*  holding up my right hand, my ring finger here is a little bit longer than my pointer finger. Okay. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4752.96s)]
*  Which one's a ring finger? Yeah. So, uh, turn it, but turn it the other way around for me. Yeah. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4759.52s)]
*  Okay. So your ring finger is a little bit longer than your pointer finger. Yeah. Okay. That is the [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4764.48s)]
*  typical heterosexual male pattern. Okay. Now people are going to be like, this is bullshit. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4769.28s)]
*  Listen, this has been replicated more than five times in humans. Okay. So on the right hand, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4773.679999999999s)]
*  and you don't know this, sometimes they look a little more equal, but it's replicated five [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4778.799999999999s)]
*  generations. Five different studies have repeated this and it holds up every single time. So, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4782.5599999999995s)]
*  and if sometimes you have to measure from that first crease on the Palm side, because it's [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4786.879999999999s)]
*  weird to measure it. Yeah. So, so this, this pointer finger is smaller than the ring finger. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4791.28s)]
*  Okay. It's called the D two to D four ratio. Scientists are super nerdy. Okay. Turns out [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4796.08s)]
*  that if you look at gay men, men that identify as gay, there, there are very few men that identify [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4801.84s)]
*  as bisexual actually, but if you look gay, gay men, that difference is much more pronounced, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4808.48s)]
*  much bigger. They have a hyper male pattern. Now it can't be due to behavior, right? You could say, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4814.56s)]
*  well, they're having sex with a lot more people, sexy increases testosterone. No, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4821.6s)]
*  it's directly related to how much testosterone you were exposed to in utero when you were in your [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4825.28s)]
*  mommy's belly. Now, can you get exposed to testosterone in your mom's belly? If someone [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4830.0s)]
*  ejaculates into the mom that hasn't been looked at, but I don't think so. There's a lot to talk [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4835.44s)]
*  about. So yeah, you can put that hand out. So, so gay, gay men have a hyper male pattern that the [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4841.52s)]
*  index finger, excuse me, the pointer finger tends to be relatively shorter than the ring finger. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4848.400000000001s)]
*  So the pointer finger is shorter than the ring finger. Yeah. Yeah. On the right hand, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4854.240000000001s)]
*  on the right hand is where it's there you go. See, so, yep. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Okay. So [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4858.56s)]
*  it's close. Well, no, no, it's a very small difference in everyone. Okay. But in gay men, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4864.240000000001s)]
*  it tends to move much greater now. So in the game end of the pointer fingers is a little bit [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4869.6s)]
*  more shorter than the ring finger. Correct. Wow. We're not talking about absolute. We're talking [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4873.68s)]
*  about the ratio. Okay. Now check this out. Now check it out. Lesbians tend to have the same pattern [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4877.68s)]
*  as heterosexual men, which is not to say they are men, right? Believe me, I got lesbian friends. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4886.88s)]
*  They are women. A lot of people, when they hear lesbian, they think of like a sort of [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4892.0s)]
*  cartoon stereotype of lesbian. There are a lot, trust me, there are a lot of different lesbians. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4895.28s)]
*  Actually, my lesbian friends recently have been trying to school me on how you spot a lesbian. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4900.16s)]
*  Turns out there's all sorts of interesting things that the lesbian community is going to get. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4904.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not supposed to give away these secrets. It's kind of like magicians, you know, but let's just [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4908.32s)]
*  say like number of rings and stuff is our like interesting correlates. Okay. Love the lesbian [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4911.679999999999s)]
*  community. Okay. We got to find some good lesbians, man, in the future. So here's what's wild. Yeah. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4917.92s)]
*  The more older brothers a guy has, the more testosterone he's exposed to in utero and the [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4922.56s)]
*  higher probability it is that he'll be gay. Wow. Now that's not always the case. It doesn't mean [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4928.4800000000005s)]
*  you have five older brothers, you'll be gay, but much higher probability of being gay. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4933.68s)]
*  If you have more older brothers with each older brother, the probability of a male [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4937.76s)]
*  baby growing up into a gay man increases significantly. Gosh. Okay. Super interesting. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4943.92s)]
*  Now, all of this is interesting because it shows that there's what we call organizational effects [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4948.72s)]
*  of hormones in utero. None of this can be because of behavior. In fact, these differences are [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4954.0s)]
*  present at birth. Okay. Okay. And then of course the question I asked when I was on the study is [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4958.0s)]
*  if I would chop off my index finger, does my testosterone go up? The answer is no. So, you know, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4962.08s)]
*  so when we think about like partner selection, like, you know, heterosexual, homosexual, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4967.6s)]
*  you know, I think years ago it was thought that this was, you know, there were still people that [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4972.16s)]
*  thought this was a behavioral choice. Listen, newsflash. This is clearly a biological phenomenon. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4977.12s)]
*  None of it clearly like, you know, and I understand that, but there's, but there's of course also [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4983.68s)]
*  flexibility. You could imagine that some people because of experience decide that they're going [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4988.4s)]
*  to, you know, bat for the other team. Oh, for sure. A lot of my gay friends, like it's not a choice, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4993.2s)]
*  right? It's just like, it's who you are. And I'm like, well, why after you've had a drink, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=4997.5199999999995s)]
*  are you trying to get me to choose it? That's a thing for me. It's like reverse psychology. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5001.92s)]
*  They're trying to trick you or something. Weiner trick. That's interesting. My lesbian friends [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5007.28s)]
*  have never tried to convince me to be a lesbian. But the, but I don't blame gay dudes if they, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5012.08s)]
*  cause I think the ultimate, the ultimate thing you can get as a gay dude is a straight dude. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5017.28s)]
*  Do you know that's the hot shit? Well, okay. So in the, I can't speak for lesbians with my close [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5021.6s)]
*  lesbian friends tell me that also, yeah, like flipping somebody for them is like considered [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5026.400000000001s)]
*  a trophy, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, so the last sort of study in this, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5031.2s)]
*  touching a big foot or whatever, there's a neuroscientist by the name of Simon Lavey, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5037.04s)]
*  who years ago looked in the brain for brain differences between gay and straight men. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5041.92s)]
*  And he found one. There's a little area of the hypothalamus called the interstitial nucleus of [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5047.12s)]
*  the anterior hypothalamus area four. That is different in size between gay men and straight [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5051.76s)]
*  men. And, you know, it's hard to argue that that comes from behavior. It could have the, the, the [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5057.92s)]
*  problem with that study is they got the brains from deceased AIDS patients and AIDS is a known [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5064.32s)]
*  neurodegenerative condition. So, you know, there's no perfect study of any of this. I don't know how [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5069.68s)]
*  we got into this, but I think basically we're talking about lesbians are going to save us all. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5073.92s)]
*  But, you know, one, one thing that I think is so important about the work you do, and seriously, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5077.92s)]
*  one of the reasons I wanted to come here today is because you're normalizing conversations about [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5083.44s)]
*  addiction, porn, sex, intimacy. You know, you asked why I think you answered your question earlier. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5090.639999999999s)]
*  Why is podcasting so big and important now? Cause you're not going to get this kind of conversation [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5097.759999999999s)]
*  on a legacy news channel. They're going to bring in somebody who was like the expert and they're [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5103.04s)]
*  going to talk about things from the perspective of never having done them. They're not going to [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5107.12s)]
*  reveal anything about themselves. And here we are kind of, you know, like, uh, like, you know, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5110.24s)]
*  brushing up against the barbed wire of some of these topics in an effort to really talk about [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5114.48s)]
*  them, because this is what a lot of people are struggling. Yeah. Some of that intimacy, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5119.04s)]
*  that intimacy disorder stuff was a nightmare for me because when I was in my twenties, I was so [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5122.719999999999s)]
*  nervous around women that I'll like a lot of times I had erectile dysfunction, you know, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5127.44s)]
*  could you talk to your partner about it? Oh, right. Back then it was probably taboo, right? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5132.719999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. No, I think I just felt defeated. You know, it felt very much like, damn, something's [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5138.16s)]
*  wrong with me. I don't know what's wrong with me, you know? And it was like, um, I remember I had, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5143.36s)]
*  uh, it's funny because kind of what, like my first girlfriend, I didn't really have it. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5151.5199999999995s)]
*  And then it started to happen. And then the same thing happened with my second girlfriend. And then [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5157.12s)]
*  after that, once I kind of got into like age 23, it was our like 24. It was like a problem for a [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5162.88s)]
*  long time. So I was like a bug in your brain. Oh yeah. So once it was like, I knew it was there, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5170.0s)]
*  then it was like always this thing. So, oh, fuck. I can't even, I forgot about all these nightmare [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5174.08s)]
*  times where you'd be on a date and you'd be like, how's this date going? And then like, are we going [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5180.4800000000005s)]
*  to get like intimate and what's going to happen? And I would like, you know, I remember like, um, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5184.400000000001s)]
*  I would eat like, you know, those gas station wiener pills, like, uh, you know, like black [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5190.400000000001s)]
*  attack 40 or whatever. I've seen them on the camera. They don't work, dude. I think they're [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5195.68s)]
*  all just caffeine and stimulus. Oh, bro. It can't be good. One of them I took. Yeah. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5199.4400000000005s)]
*  Just zoom in on some of those. No, that's day quill. I mean, that's not going to help anybody. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5205.76s)]
*  Uh, yeah. Triple green, Rhino 87, macho man, um, white black guy. That's a crazy name for one. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5210.08s)]
*  Wait, what? Yeah. I made that up. Okay. I didn't see that there. I thought I might, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5218.16s)]
*  I have a visual defect or something. Oh yeah. Uh, body beast or whatever. King Kong. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5221.36s)]
*  But nowadays a lot of this has worked out because, you know, the, the drug to dollop fill, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5226.24s)]
*  also known as Cialis was developed as a way to increase blood flow to the prostate. By the way, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5230.96s)]
*  every male 35 or older, this was suggested by the director of male sexual health at Stanford [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5237.2s)]
*  school of medicine, Mike Eisenberg. So I'm not just pulling this out of nowhere. Every male 35 [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5242.4s)]
*  or older should probably be on a low dose, 2.5 to five milligrams of to dollop fill per in the [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5247.92s)]
*  evening. It's very inexpensive. It does require a prescription. Why? Because the prostate needs [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5253.6s)]
*  blood flow and it also serves, you know, it has this pro erectile function, right? And then, and [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5258.08s)]
*  of course one has to do all the other things correctly. You gotta be sleeping, exercising, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5263.6s)]
*  et cetera. Also, a lot of guys think they should be doing kegels, you know, that thing where you're [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5267.2s)]
*  like, you know, kind of tight, that actually will tighten your pelvic floor and block blood flow to [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5270.32s)]
*  the penis and make erection more difficult. Yeah. So they, you know, a lot of this stuff wasn't [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5274.48s)]
*  taught. I, yeah, I remember I would take some, so much sometime. I remember one time I was trying to [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5279.5199999999995s)]
*  like perform, like have sex with this gal or something. And my, I'd taken some of those [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5285.36s)]
*  winter pills, my nose just started bleeding all over this woman. And I was like, what is happening? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5290.0s)]
*  Did she freak out? Huh? I don't know. It was in Miami. Everybody, we had like a belly full of crab [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5296.0s)]
*  or whatever, but it was like this nice crab place. But it was like, and my nose just, it was just like, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5300.24s)]
*  that was crazy. But it just became this crazy dance in my head where it was like winter pills, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5304.96s)]
*  trying to be normal, like trying to calm down, like put an ice in my shirt, just all these things to [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5312.16s)]
*  like chill, like just be able to be normal for sex. That shit was a nightmare. Yeah. I mean, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5317.92s)]
*  it was a nightmare. And then you're stuck in this universe where that is becomes like your whole [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5324.4s)]
*  battle. And then you get afraid to even talk to girls sometimes or relate to them. Cause you're [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5329.84s)]
*  like, well, what, you know, if I take a girl down this road and it's not able to work out, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5333.28s)]
*  then who am I then? Where am I at? You know? Yeah. And then imagine that, but layered on top of that [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5338.4800000000005s)]
*  is the fear of being shamed by, oh, listen, I don't know that I, you know, I'm just going to bring it [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5344.400000000001s)]
*  up. I don't know the specifics, but I remember hearing a few years ago, there was a comedian who [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5349.52s)]
*  was like shamed for being bad in bed or something. Was it just like, uh, and that was one of the first [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5354.24s)]
*  he was kind of canceled for being bad in bed. Wasn't that that was, all right. Well, and listen, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5359.360000000001s)]
*  if there was like coercive stuff or whatever, I don't know, but I wasn't there. Obviously, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5364.4800000000005s)]
*  obviously didn't read the article either, but I think, you know, you layer on top the fear of [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5368.320000000001s)]
*  being shamed, right? And all of a sudden, you know, like you're talking about collapsing a [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5373.04s)]
*  young male's existence. I mean, you know, I think, yeah, I, like I said, for the fourth time, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5379.04s)]
*  forgive me for repeating myself 49. So I, you look young, man. Thanks, man. I feel good. Well, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5384.8s)]
*  listen, I quit drinking. I never drank that much, but also I've been doing things that I love. I [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5389.4400000000005s)]
*  wasn't going to say that one of the things that will keep you young is dopamine, not from [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5393.04s)]
*  pharmacology, but being in pursuit of things that you love. Positive anticipation. But I think that [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5396.88s)]
*  let's go into that in just a second, but let's finish out this. Yeah. You were saying, yeah, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5402.56s)]
*  I think that, you know, I benefited tremendously from being open with that first girlfriend, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5405.76s)]
*  yes. That first girlfriend just saying, Hey, like, you know, like she had this like buff boyfriend [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5416.0s)]
*  in another school, but actually it was wild because he ended up killing himself. And that was years [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5423.68s)]
*  later. And I remember thinking this guy was like the football hero, right? He ended up becoming [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5429.6s)]
*  spied. And I remember thinking, wow, I thought in my mind he was like, couldn't be outdone. Right? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5433.84s)]
*  And so talking to her, I remember her just saying like, first she said something like, we were kids, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5439.76s)]
*  right? We were like 16, you know, she said, you know, you're, you're wonderful. And I remember [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5444.72s)]
*  thinking like, I don't want to be called wonderful. Like I'm trying to get good at this thing. Right? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5449.28s)]
*  And I think if I've learned anything, like if I could send like a, like all points bulletin out, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5453.28s)]
*  it's like everything we know about the erectile response is that it's what we call [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5458.32s)]
*  parasympathetic. It comes from the relaxation response. Orgasm is related to, it's almost like [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5462.8s)]
*  a stress of sorts. It's pleasureful, but high arousal. The key to all of it is a lot of exhales, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5467.360000000001s)]
*  lot of nasal breathing, and just slow the whole thing down. Slow the whole thing down that you, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5475.04s)]
*  you know, later, once you're comfortable with somebody, if you got like five minutes and you're [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5483.04s)]
*  going to like go for the quickie thing in the kitchen before you leave to work, okay. That's a, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5486.24s)]
*  a whole program. Okay. That's like that, that guy, lethal shooter on Instagram, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5490.48s)]
*  the guy can make a basket from anywhere. Like he worked up to that. The, what you're trying to do [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5496.0s)]
*  is slow down the whole thing, like, and get into sensation. You got to get out of your head. Now [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5501.76s)]
*  it's one thing to say, get out of your head. It's another to do it. So the whole process there starts [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5507.76s)]
*  with just only going so far as then you communicate with first, slow down. These things have a real [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5512.4s)]
*  beauty to them because when people start entering that dance and communicating well with one another, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5518.64s)]
*  all of a sudden, like the magic of biology takes over and then someone thinks, oh, well, now it's [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5525.280000000001s)]
*  going to go back. Then you just kind of restart and do the whole thing. And nowadays I think young [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5530.4800000000005s)]
*  males go quickly. They're like, I'm going to take 20 milligrams. It's a dollar fill this out. Listen, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5534.64s)]
*  that probably would help, but learning how to do this, this thing that we call intimacy, right? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5538.88s)]
*  I mean, intimacy is a lot of things, but knowing that what's happening there is between the two [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5544.0s)]
*  of you. And that also means you guys, because there's also been a long history of men talking [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5548.48s)]
*  about all the women they slept with. And then that doesn't feel good necessarily to other women. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5553.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5557.919999999999s)]
*  So the real, the art of intimacy is something that we've lost. And listen, I'm not saying that [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5559.04s)]
*  all sexes has this element. Sometimes people just want to get together and get raw, but that's [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5564.719999999999s)]
*  an advanced skill that you may or may not want to engage in. And I think that slowing the whole [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5571.04s)]
*  thing down, like, Hey, we're going to be together in bed four times before we ever actually have [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5576.4s)]
*  intercourse. Like that's weird to look at you while I say that, but you know what I'm talking about. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5581.839999999999s)]
*  No, hell no. It would have been great. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5585.599999999999s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that can transform, not only avoids problems, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5587.599999999999s)]
*  but can transform your notion of like what's possible in relationship. Slow, slow, slow, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5592.48s)]
*  and then once that intimacy is set, then there can be some more adventurous exploration at speed. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5600.08s)]
*  But it's all about, it's all about slowing that thing down, slowing the whole process down. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5607.52s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I remember, Oh dude, I remember this freaking, my girlfriend at the time. I was like, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5615.68s)]
*  I thought I couldn't get an erection, right? So I had her call me a different name. Like we're [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5622.88s)]
*  making out. That was your, that was your solution. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5626.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, this dude, Robert in our, in our grade was getting mad erections. Everybody was saying, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5628.32s)]
*  and I'll be like, call me. And I, Oh, this is so embarrassing, but I'll be like, call me Robert, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5632.16s)]
*  call me Robert. And it didn't fucking help. And she's like, it was just the most embarrassed. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5636.719999999999s)]
*  That shit was super embarrassing, dude. Cause even if I was Robert, I couldn't even get an [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5641.679999999999s)]
*  erection at the time. So that was horrible. Try and think of what else happened, dude. Oh, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5645.2s)]
*  I've gone, I mean, you know, over the years I've gone, you know, down the gamut of all of it, like [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5648.5599999999995s)]
*  hiring escorts or, you know, thinking like, Oh, we need more than one part. Like all that, like [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5652.96s)]
*  just thinking like all these things would change it, you know, drugs, alcohol, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5660.24s)]
*  like all these different things to like trying to fine tune how I would feel. Okay. I think even [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5663.84s)]
*  just to be in like a conversation, like just to be like an intimate conversation, like, Oh, I wished [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5670.4800000000005s)]
*  I would have from the beginning been like just with a girl I've been, Hey, like this is what's [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5677.44s)]
*  going on and this is how I'm feeling. And this is what's popping, you know? And like, and even made [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5681.2s)]
*  it cool or whatever. And it would have brought us closer together, but instead I took this huge [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5685.679999999999s)]
*  bypass of like things that I thought would like, I thought that intimacy was just a, um, one man [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5690.4s)]
*  show. Well, that, yeah, it's so important what you're saying that it was all your responsibility. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5698.16s)]
*  Does that make any sense or not? Yeah. Listen, newsflash men and women, there are women who are [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5702.48s)]
*  great in bed and there are women who are not great in bed. You know, there are great lovers who are [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5706.8s)]
*  women. There are not great lowers. I'll tell you what makes a great female lover. Yeah. Somebody [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5712.400000000001s)]
*  who can relax and enjoy herself. And part of that is the communication and also somebody who's tuned [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5716.96s)]
*  into what works for you. You know, it took me a long time because I listen, I think all young men [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5723.28s)]
*  deal with this, right? You want to perform well. And it's interesting. You mentioned Robert, and I [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5727.6s)]
*  mentioned this other guy that sadly eventually killed himself, but every young male knows the [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5731.360000000001s)]
*  experience of there's like this satellite male, you're holding yourself up against this image in [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5736.16s)]
*  an idea, right? This image and idea, that's very dangerous thinking. You know what I think? I think [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5740.08s)]
*  that every male should understand that at some point you're the satellite male. You're the [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5746.08s)]
*  satellite male. So you got to get out of that kind of thinking and understand that like, like dancing, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5751.5199999999995s)]
*  like athletics, like it takes time to get good at, you need reps and you need reps under conditions [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5758.5599999999995s)]
*  where you can learn. You know, I think, you know, it sounds like you put the pressure on yourself to [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5763.92s)]
*  be like a sexual athlete from go and like, you got to learn layups, no pun intended. You got to learn [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5768.32s)]
*  that your free throws, you got to lay downs, but I look at all that pornography. That's what it was. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5774.8s)]
*  I've been looking at all that Parno, you know, and it got me all bent out. Yeah. It's like, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5779.12s)]
*  if you want to play basketball, you don't go look at lethal shooters, Instagram and go, I'm going to [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5782.8s)]
*  do that tomorrow. Yeah. I mean, he built up to that, you know, so I think we're using an analogy [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5787.44s)]
*  here and metaphor, but it's just so important that this guy is like, he's just like that. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5793.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And I'll tell you, no, it's reps. It's reps, reps, reps. He did a live one night that I caught [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5802.4s)]
*  really late at night when I was in New York. He's, he can visually measure the angle. The ball has [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5807.839999999999s)]
*  to go in. He's not shooting. He is shooting for the basket, but he's trying to put the ball in a cone [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5813.12s)]
*  of a particular angle. He's looking above the basket at the, at the angle. He needs to sink that [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5818.72s)]
*  thing. He'll put a gummy bear into a 16 ounce bottle from across a court. And then he yells at [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5823.28s)]
*  you for doubting him. Oh, I love that. What's he doing here? Oh, he's, what do they call that game? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5828.48s)]
*  Game, uh, corn hole or what a weird name for a game. Yeah. You wonder how it started. Boom. Look [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5834.64s)]
*  at this guy, bean bag. And he goes, I understand it now. So yeah, he's really good. That man, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5840.88s)]
*  lethal shooter right there. Yeah. He reps. He worked up to that and he didn't work up to it by [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5846.64s)]
*  picking up a basketball, metaphorically speaking and saying, okay, I got to make this or else my [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5852.0s)]
*  life is destroyed and people are going to be talking about it. No. So I think there has to be [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5855.92s)]
*  a private world, an intimate world where people can explore in a healthy way, communicate in a [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5859.92s)]
*  healthy way and know it's between them. And then you get to this beautiful vista with intimacy, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5865.2s)]
*  where you're like, I love this or I love that. And, you know, I mean, uh, and it brings people [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5870.8s)]
*  together. Oh, I mean, listen, I mean, I want to be respectful to, you know, my former partners, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5876.48s)]
*  but you know, it's one of these things where you go like, wow, like I really, I really learned [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5882.0s)]
*  something from that person. Now, of course, as a man, you also have to have an ego intact enough [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5886.24s)]
*  to know she learned a few things from somebody else too, right? Unless you, unless it's a first [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5890.4s)]
*  relationship, this notion that you're the only person that's ever been there is quite rare. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5894.08s)]
*  And part of being a grown male is accepting that. And frankly, you know, different, different strokes [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5899.28s)]
*  for different folks, you know, but I think you got to understand like we're all, we're all here [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5904.64s)]
*  because either in a dish or in a human sperm, egg, okay, this drive that's dopamine driven to [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5909.92s)]
*  reproduce and sex, the reason those things are so closely woven is that drives so much a culture [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5916.4s)]
*  and behavior and shame and addiction and pleasure and all this stuff is because it's why we're here. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5921.68s)]
*  Like, right. I mean, this is, this is, this is everything. And you know, now Elon and other [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5927.52s)]
*  people are talking about how the, you know, the, the replacement rate for humans is way, way down [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5932.4800000000005s)]
*  because we have birth control and people aren't having sex as much. I mean, it is possible [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5936.96s)]
*  that humans fail to replace themselves as a species, you know? And then you got guys like him [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5941.68s)]
*  who are trying to make up for that deficit. Oh yeah. He's popping off, dude. He's got like, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5946.72s)]
*  what, like 14 kids or something. He'll knock up a parking meter. He's the only dude who put, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5950.72s)]
*  yeah, he put definitely he'll get it. I want to pivot a little bit. I saw an, there's, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5957.76s)]
*  we're starting to see stuff. Like I've been, I've been noticing recently these [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5963.280000000001s)]
*  articles about measles. Have you seen this stuff hitting the airwaves? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5967.2s)]
*  Is that realistic? It just starts to seem, if you can see one of them, Nick, and bring it up. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5971.6s)]
*  Person may have spread measles at Shakira concert in MetLife stadium. Health officials say, right? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5976.16s)]
*  This just seems like a person who attended a Shakira concert at MetLife stadium on May 15th [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5984.32s)]
*  was infected with measles and may have spread the highly contagious virus at the event. Health [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5989.28s)]
*  officials say this almost reads like the beginning of a movie, right? Like highly contagious, infected [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=5993.76s)]
*  spread at a concert. So it makes it super scary, right? All these, but like all the viruses tend [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6000.08s)]
*  to spread more quickly indoors. Measles can live in an airspace for up to two hours and it's highly [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6006.08s)]
*  transmissible, especially amongst the unvaccinated. So this is an article. What's this in? This is [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6010.88s)]
*  North Jersey.com, which is owned by USA today. Okay. Okay. Conventional media. So, so I'm just [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6017.6s)]
*  like, what is going on here? Are we, are they just trying to see another thing that will stick to [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6022.88s)]
*  society? Would you, as a scientist, what do you even think when you read something like this? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6027.6s)]
*  Okay. Super important specific and general question you're asking. First question as a [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6032.4s)]
*  scientist, I would ask is what was the frequency of people with measles coming into the hospital [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6038.16s)]
*  before there was a focus on measles? Got it. Like two years ago, before the discussion about measles [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6044.32s)]
*  and vaccines was as prominent, at least measles vaccines, right? Back then it was all about COVID [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6049.28s)]
*  vaccines. But so I'd say how, you know, if we were to look in the medical history, because hospitals [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6053.28s)]
*  keep records, you know, in the, this was in East Rutherford, okay. So in New Jersey, I have relatives [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6057.84s)]
*  in New Jersey, how many measles cases were identified in the last 10 years? Right. And [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6063.84s)]
*  what percentage of those reported having been in a public place prior? That's what I'd want to know, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6070.72s)]
*  because that will tell you whether or not this is the media amplifying. Here we go. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6076.96s)]
*  Texas outbreak drives up early US measles cases in early 2025. Number of measles cases reported in [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6081.76s)]
*  the US per year. Yeah. Well, we hear about these things like bird flu. Remember a few years back, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6086.72s)]
*  it was monkeypox. Yeah. Monkeypox. We don't hear about monkeypox anymore. That was like monkeypox [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6091.68s)]
*  is coming for us. Every, every, every couple months, there's something that pops off like this. Every [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6096.88s)]
*  few months, it's like hoof mouth syndrome or canary baby. There are cases of measles that can be very [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6101.04s)]
*  detrimental, but there's an episode of the Brady Bunch. Do you remember this episode of the Brady [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6107.6s)]
*  Bunch where they all get measles and then at the end, Alice walks in and she's got the spots and [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6111.360000000001s)]
*  she goes, I've got measles too. You know, when I was a kid, I had the chickenpox. Now I'm not trying [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6116.16s)]
*  to make light of the measles, right? Like any infectious disease, there's inflammation of the [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6120.32s)]
*  body and brain. There are cases where these diseases cause serious long-term effects. And then [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6125.68s)]
*  there are cases where it has less of an effect. The most important thing to understand for me would [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6130.48s)]
*  be what are the real statistics of like, is measles becoming more frequent? Is that tied to the shift? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6135.68s)]
*  Because let's face it, regardless of where you stand on the issue of vaccination, people are now [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6141.84s)]
*  taking a look again at vaccination. The vaccine schedules have expanded, right? You know, I'm part [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6146.16s)]
*  of the medical community. I'm an employee at Stanford School of Medicine. And I would say I [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6151.68s)]
*  fall more, just full disclosure, into the more conventional standpoint of this. I want to be [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6155.68s)]
*  really clear because of, I do believe that there are certain vaccinations that are highly beneficial. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6160.639999999999s)]
*  I also think there are a number of vaccinations that for public health reasons should be explored [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6168.08s)]
*  further if for no other reason to discover that yes, we were right or no, we were wrong. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6174.96s)]
*  It's just critically important. I mean, you know, I think any good, any self-respecting scientists [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6180.08s)]
*  would say, those are the data, let's look again. Now there's this real twist in the data around [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6185.6s)]
*  the autism vaccine thing. That's very, that's really unfortunate. And this is one of the reasons [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6191.28s)]
*  why this is such a hot button issue is that the guy, Andrew Wakefield, who originally tried to tie [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6196.32s)]
*  the vaccine to autism, he was found guilty of fraud. Okay. Now I wasn't involved in the papers [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6201.36s)]
*  of the case, but like that puts a twist in everything because I believe he did, or he at [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6207.04s)]
*  least lost his medical license. Okay. There have been other instances, you know, of scientific [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6212.32s)]
*  fraud, but that one in particular caused the entire field to assume he was completely wrong [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6217.92s)]
*  about everything. And now there are folks like Robert Kennedy, who is like him or not, is our [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6223.599999999999s)]
*  head of HHS. Okay. I actually know Robert. I actually, I'm going to host Jay Bhattacharya, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6227.68s)]
*  who was my colleague at Stanford on the, he's the head of NIH. And so I think right now there's a, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6232.160000000001s)]
*  there's here, what were the consequences? Andrew Wakefield did not go to prison, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6237.76s)]
*  although he was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the UK general [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6240.72s)]
*  medical council and was struck off the medical register, effectively ending his career as a [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6243.68s)]
*  physician. There was no record or evidence that he was ever criminally prosecuted or imprisoned [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6247.52s)]
*  for his actions related to the fraudulent 1998 Lancet study linking the MMR vaccine to autism. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6250.96s)]
*  The sanctions against him were professional and civil, not criminal. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6256.4s)]
*  So an important thing that must be done. I know this issue is, you know, I'm going to catch hate [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6260.4s)]
*  either way. What's a hot issue. Right. It's a super hot issue. Listen, as a parent, can you imagine [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6265.5199999999995s)]
*  you have a kid and your kid seems for all measures, perfectly healthy, has some treatment vaccine or a [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6270.639999999999s)]
*  pill or a trip to, you know, at the supermarket and that kid fundamentally changes their behavior [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6277.839999999999s)]
*  afterwards. You know, the one thing we know is, you know, this is also a deep hypothalamic circuit. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6283.44s)]
*  As we say, there is a hardwired circuit for mothers, especially, you know, dads can be protective, [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6289.04s)]
*  but mothers to protect their young. So, you know, when the moms are pissed off and curious, they are [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6294.16s)]
*  on re Lenting and no amount of discussion about that was resolved because the Wakefield thing was [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6300.879999999999s)]
*  gone is going to satisfy them. So my, my personal take is run the studies you need to run. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6306.32s)]
*  Make sure they're run properly from it with an unbiased look at all of this. So important because [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6313.759999999999s)]
*  the thing about vaccines and autism is really a microcosm for a much larger theme about how much [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6319.599999999999s)]
*  can we trust the medical community. And listen, I know scientists, I was weaned in this. My dad's a [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6323.759999999999s)]
*  scientist. Like most scientists, like 99.9% of scientists want to get things right. We are in the [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6328.5599999999995s)]
*  business of trying to un-tease the secrets of nature and do good things with them. Okay. And [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6334.5599999999995s)]
*  yet there are those that will manipulate the system. No one goes into science to get rich. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6341.92s)]
*  They go into biotech to get rich, but you don't become a bench scientist at a university to get [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6347.68s)]
*  rich. Trust me. But how can those scientists be manipulated as a group? Like when you look back [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6351.52s)]
*  at like, how can that happen? Like is it journals that are compromised? Is it the medical energy [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6355.44s)]
*  that gets compromised? But how do you have like a whole, you know? Sure. So I'll try and keep this [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6360.72s)]
*  relatively succinct. This is a whole landscape and it's something that is like really deep [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6366.16s)]
*  and important to me as a science communicator, health communicator who has friends on both sides, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6371.76s)]
*  you know, of these debates. The most important thing to understand is scientists are trying to [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6376.5599999999995s)]
*  figure out the truth. They are also human and they're highly incentivized to advance their [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6381.36s)]
*  careers. One of the things that I've observed in science is not people making up data. That's [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6386.72s)]
*  exceedingly rare, but scientists sometimes when they don't get the answer they want in an experiment, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6393.36s)]
*  they'll come up with reasons for why that experiment probably wasn't run right. And [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6399.92s)]
*  maybe we should discard the data. Okay. Let's say that one time when they don't get, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6404.24s)]
*  when they don't get the answer they want, they will come up with reasons why, oh, that antibody [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6407.44s)]
*  wasn't as a fresh or, you know, the conditions weren't right. And they will start to steer the [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6411.92s)]
*  data, steer the experiment. I have observed that. Okay. I've observed that a lot in my career, [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6417.2s)]
*  sadly. Far less common are people outright making up data, what we call fudging data, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6422.639999999999s)]
*  just like making up numbers. There's a famous case in nanotechnology of this kid whose last name was [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6429.04s)]
*  Shone. He was like a wonder kid in the sense that he had like, it's very hard to publish papers in [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6433.28s)]
*  science or nature. This is like the Superbowl rings of science. I've had a couple in nature, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6437.5199999999995s)]
*  a couple in science, and I feel immensely blessed for that. Shone was publishing 12 papers a year [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6442.24s)]
*  in nature and science. And at some point, people start looking more closely at their data. Okay. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6447.5199999999995s)]
*  And what happened? They saw that the random noise plots, random should be random, right? You don't [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6454.639999999999s)]
*  need to be a scientist or a genius to understand that random should be random. He was so lazy [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6460.639999999999s)]
*  that he was replotting the random noise in two different experiments. You can't get the same [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6465.44s)]
*  random noise in two different experiments. So there are bad apples like him. He's gone now, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6470.0s)]
*  but most scientists are trying to get it right. And yet there's this thing that we have to [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6475.28s)]
*  constantly check ourselves on. This is why you have to, what we call blind the data. You look at it, [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6480.08s)]
*  not knowing what condition you're looking at. This is why replication is so key. And the big [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6484.24s)]
*  problem in science, and I do think this new administration cares about this, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6488.16s)]
*  it's hard to get a job as a professor for replicating work. Everyone wants to see the [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6493.76s)]
*  new thing. So a PhD student comes into my lab. They want to study something. We rarely say, [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6499.04s)]
*  oh, let's go do what someone else did, make sure they're right. No, you pick something new. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6503.28s)]
*  So a lot of mistakes have passed, get kind of baked into the field. And this is what happened [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6506.96s)]
*  in the Alzheimer's field. This is why, you know, one mistake, which probably was somebody outright [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6511.44s)]
*  fudging as well, making stuff up, kind of get woven into the lineage. Then other papers get [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6517.36s)]
*  published more easily. And then lo and behold, 25 years later, we said, we don't have a single [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6521.5199999999995s)]
*  good treatment for Alzheimer's. Best thing you can do is get good sleep. There's a little study out [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6525.28s)]
*  today about creatine may be helping, but we're just nipping around the corners of this extremely [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6528.64s)]
*  important problem. I must say, and this is not for political correctness. Listen, I'm a tenured [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6532.8s)]
*  professor at Stanford, so I don't have to worry about quote unquote losing my job. I mean, there [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6538.72s)]
*  are ways you can lose your job even with tenure. But I just want to say with all the bad things [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6542.320000000001s)]
*  about science, the Wakefield thing, the Alzheimer's thing, the replication crisis, the lack of [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6546.88s)]
*  incentive for people to replicate work. I do have to say something very important. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6552.88s)]
*  There are so many treatments for diseases that exist nowadays that we take for granted that [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6559.04s)]
*  were born out of basic research. Scientists in the lab just trying to figure things out without the [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6564.96s)]
*  idea of a treatment someday. My scientific great grandparents, I mentioned them earlier, David Hewlett [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6569.4400000000005s)]
*  and Torrance and Weasel did that experiment of closing one eye in a kitty cat and monkey [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6573.76s)]
*  showed that the brain is immensely plastic. That gave birth, excuse me, that gave birth to an [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6578.56s)]
*  entire field of the molecules involved and the hormones involved and why it shuts down with age, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6582.56s)]
*  how to open plasticity in adulthood. In many ways, it's given rise to this whole field of psychedelics [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6587.280000000001s)]
*  for the treatment of brain disorders in order to reopen plasticity. They did not do those [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6591.68s)]
*  experiments thinking there would be any medical application. But we now know as compared to the [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6599.120000000001s)]
*  70s when a kid has a lazy eye or a cataract or what we call strabismus or any of that, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6603.76s)]
*  we now know to get in and treat those eye diseases early while the brain is still plastic. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6609.6s)]
*  Their work has saved the vision. In other words, has prevented blindness of countless people around [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6614.4800000000005s)]
*  the world. And there's this whole initiative in places overseas to remove cataracts, save vision. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6620.88s)]
*  So I can give you a million, not a million, I can give you thousands of examples of that. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6626.0s)]
*  Immunotherapies for cancer, neuroplasticity, the incredible work being done on psilocybin [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6630.88s)]
*  for depression, MDMA, which hopefully will be approved by the FDA soon for the treatment of [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6636.64s)]
*  PTSD, incredible 70% remission rates. The understanding of that drug, methylene, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6641.52s)]
*  dioxin, methamphetamines, methamphetamine with a little twist, okay? The understanding of that was [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6648.4800000000005s)]
*  born out of serious scientists slaving away in their labs for very little pay because they love [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6653.52s)]
*  discovery. And I'm not saying that to just kind of say, oh, all scientists are great, but I think [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6661.200000000001s)]
*  we have to be very careful. The replication crisis is real. We need to take another look at all issues [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6667.4400000000005s)]
*  related to public health. You can tell I'm very passionate about this. Listen, I text Bobby all [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6672.64s)]
*  the time. I'm like, listen, man, we got to look at this. We got to look at, and you know what? We [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6676.72s)]
*  can't allow ourselves to go too far in one direction or the other. I say let's not waste [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6680.72s)]
*  any time. Let's take a look at all these vaccines again in great controlled studies. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6686.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, what do we lose by looking at them? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6689.84s)]
*  Nothing. But I'll tell you, to say what I'm saying here, like I'm going to, this will be cut and [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6691.12s)]
*  clipped and contorted. You know, I'm just going to come out with it. Trad medias, you know, the [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6697.2s)]
*  moment I started showing up on Rogan, listen, I think Joe Rogan has done tremendous amount of good [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6702.08s)]
*  for science communication. Matt Walker, me, David Sinclair, other people on there, physicists, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6707.04s)]
*  you know, but then the adjacency to anyone who's asking these larger questions puts you in the [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6711.44s)]
*  bullseye of, oh, you know, he, you know, Andrews of science denier, flat earth or whatever. No, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6717.12s)]
*  I believe that any solid field should be subject to self scrutiny and outside scrutiny. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6723.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6729.04s)]
*  And this is why, listen, I published a number of papers and I always say, listen, I'm happy to be [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6729.36s)]
*  wrong for the right reasons. Like we were trying our damnedest to get it right. You can't be wrong [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6734.16s)]
*  for the wrong reasons. Like making shit up. You make a mistake, you correct yourself. It's called [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6738.72s)]
*  being an adult. And you can tell that like my, this gets my energy going because I will tell you, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6743.2s)]
*  I am very concerned about the future of science in this country either way, because we've got to [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6748.48s)]
*  split right down the middle. And there's all this finger pointing and somebody, hopefully Jay [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6752.88s)]
*  Bhattacharya, our new director of the NIH, God willing, he's going to bridge this gap. I'm trying [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6757.5199999999995s)]
*  to do what I can behind the scenes to really get people talking. Cause there's so much shit talking [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6763.36s)]
*  behind the, you know, I hate them and I hate them. And then, but listen, we all got to live in this [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6768.24s)]
*  world. Forgive me for going on a monologue, but I'm telling you, we need, we need to take a hard look [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6772.799999999999s)]
*  at ourselves. And we really, really need to, whatever we explore, we need to explore it [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6779.5199999999995s)]
*  properly. But scientists are good people, man. And I don't make my living doing science anymore. So I [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6784.24s)]
*  can say that with no bias. They're good people, 99.9% of them. And then, and those bad apples, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6789.28s)]
*  excuse my language, but fuck them. Oh, for sure. Fuck them. Because they ruin it all for everybody. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6794.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. Well, and it also leads to impairment. It leads to disease. It leads to, you know, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6799.92s)]
*  atrocities that happen to people. And it's for, usually for the sake of profit. Do you believe [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6806.16s)]
*  that big pharma would lobby against, um, certain, uh, tests being done or, uh, residual testing, [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6811.36s)]
*  re-examination of, of, of past findings, et cetera, in order to keep things a certain way. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6821.759999999999s)]
*  Okay. So does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. So two things about big pharma. First of all, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6828.4s)]
*  I don't have any direct links to big pharma. You know, people think, cause I'm at Stanford, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6833.599999999999s)]
*  I've been accused of being part of MK ultra. I don't even know what that is, but sounds scary. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6837.2s)]
*  I don't know, dude. Fucking lost. I've been told, I've been told I'm a CIA plant MK ultra. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6841.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, this stuff is crazy. Oh dude. Somebody told me I went to the middle east or something. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6847.2s)]
*  Somebody said I was working for something, Bangladesh or something. I was like, dude, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6850.799999999999s)]
*  I don't, I've never had anybody asked me to do anything. I wasn't even born. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6854.719999999999s)]
*  I wasn't even born. I was born in 75. Yeah. Well, so big pharma, look, they're a business. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6858.88s)]
*  Okay. So there are drugs like SSRIs where, which we will say have been not so helpful for the [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6865.12s)]
*  treatment of depression for most people, but guess what? SSRIs are tremendously helpful for [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6872.16s)]
*  people with OCD. Real OCD is a condition where the compulsion, the behavior makes the obsession [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6877.36s)]
*  worse. Imagine mosquito bite every time you scratch it, it is worse and worse and worse [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6882.8s)]
*  destroys lives. SSRIs have helped those people a lot. The drug companies are highly incentivized [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6887.44s)]
*  to keep drugs out of generic so that the prices come down. They do a game. I know this because I [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6892.64s)]
*  was involved in exploring drugs for eye disease years ago and I would learn from these companies. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6898.160000000001s)]
*  If you can have a drug that goes through all the research and development costs millions of dollars [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6902.64s)]
*  and then is used, say for the treatment of a heart condition, if you can bypass the need to do all the [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6907.6s)]
*  safety studies because you discovered that that drug is now also useful for say preserving vision [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6912.4800000000005s)]
*  and macular degeneration or glaucoma or diabetes, whatever. You save yourself a lot of money, same [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6916.96s)]
*  drug, you maintain the patent and you can't have generic competitors. So drug companies, I don't [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6923.12s)]
*  think people talk about this enough, are highly incentivized to not discover new drugs, but rather [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6927.84s)]
*  to continue with the same drugs and find new uses for the same drugs. That's rarely talked about. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6932.72s)]
*  That's a serious problem. The other thing about drug companies- Because the negative side effect [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6937.68s)]
*  of that is what? That something gets kind of shoehorned in and working for something, but the- [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6941.76s)]
*  Very expensive drugs for everybody because if you look at the difference between a- Like there are [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6945.68s)]
*  these new sleep medications called the Doras. They shut down the wakefulness system as opposed [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6949.92s)]
*  to making you sleepy. They have a lot less abuse potential. They're like $300 a month and as long [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6953.68s)]
*  as they can maintain the patent on that, there won't be the generic version because it probably [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6958.72s)]
*  costs the profit margins on these things are huge because they're trying to cover the research and [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6962.16s)]
*  development they did. There's, you know, so that's just one example, but the drug companies are [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6966.4800000000005s)]
*  incentivized. Yeah, the Doras. I've tried them. I felt lousy. And is that like Ambien or whatever? [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6971.36s)]
*  No. So Ambien is a problem because it can give you memory issues. This works through something [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6979.839999999999s)]
*  called the hypocretinorexin system. It was discovered in narcoleptic dogs in the basement [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6983.92s)]
*  of Stanford, believe it or not. There's all sorts of cool stuff there, but the drug companies are [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6988.88s)]
*  a concern in one sense, which is that, look, dopamine, as we learned, is involved in movement. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6994.24s)]
*  It's involved in reward. Schizophrenics take drugs to block dopamine. And if you see someone [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=6999.44s)]
*  on the street corner nowadays, it's complicated with fentanyl, but you see the person kind of [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7004.879999999999s)]
*  writhing. It's called tardive dyskinesia. That's because those drugs, the neuroleptics, as we call [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7008.48s)]
*  them, reduce the auditory hallucinations. They relieve a lot of those symptoms of schizophrenia, [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7014.08s)]
*  but it also hits dopamine in the spinal system, the motor system. And then they have these motor [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7018.639999999999s)]
*  side effects. So there are, the problem is most pharmaceuticals have side effects because most [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7023.5199999999995s)]
*  chemicals like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, they're in multiple places in the brain, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7030.32s)]
*  not just the area that you're concerned about repairing. So I'm not super anti-big pharma, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7035.44s)]
*  but I will say I am very pro self-directed healthcare. That's why I'm a big part of my [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7042.0s)]
*  initiative with the podcast is get people getting sunlight in their eyes in the evening, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7047.28s)]
*  get some sunlight in your eyes in the morning, hydrate, exercise, get on a normal circadian [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7050.96s)]
*  rhythm. One of the most important things for mental health is bright mornings and days, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7058.08s)]
*  dark nights. And how do you get on that circadian rhythm, man? That's something that I've struggled [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7064.0s)]
*  with. I think my circadian rhythm is God, it's a, I'm going to turn into a cicada. Well, we got to [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7068.0s)]
*  get you some of the red lens glasses. I'm not doing a promotional here, but getting the screens dim [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7072.4s)]
*  or wearing red lens glasses in the evening to block the blue and green lights. But how to even [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7076.5599999999995s)]
*  set up a circadian rhythm, bright light in the morning. If you wake up and the sun's out, get [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7080.72s)]
*  outside, take that brimmed hat off, take the sunglasses off, look in the direction of the sun. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7084.96s)]
*  You don't have to force yourself to get five to 15 minutes of sunlight, drink your coffee, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7090.0s)]
*  get some exercise, maybe even do like a hundred jumping jacks, get your system going. Very simple [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7094.4s)]
*  way to put this is early in the day, you want movement, caffeine, hydration, sunlight. If you [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7098.64s)]
*  can't get sunlight, you get bright light from like an artificial light. You can get a 10,000 lux light [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7103.68s)]
*  on Amazon for like a hundred bucks. I have no relationship to any of those companies. Get your [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7108.0s)]
*  morning kind of going. You know, it's hard to be jocke-willing. It's hard, but you got to kind of [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7112.0s)]
*  force a little bit of that on yourself. And then the afternoon taper off the caffeine, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7117.92s)]
*  dim the screens, lower your heart rate, do some long exhale breathing, you know, just take it down [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7123.12s)]
*  a notch. And over about three days of doing that, what you'll find is I start to wake up in [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7129.68s)]
*  anticipation of the day. You have this circadian rhythm that learns, well, I'm going to be active [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7134.8s)]
*  in a few hours and you start waking up in the morning. You had a particular time, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7139.76s)]
*  that whole phenomenon. You set your clock for 7 AM and you wake up at 6 59. Your brain is clocking [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7143.68s)]
*  time. So does that mean you need to go to bed at like 8 PM for a week to get your circadian rhythm [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7148.8s)]
*  set? Or what's the truth? Everyone's slightly different, different chronotypes. So I do best, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7153.12s)]
*  for instance, I know if I had total control going to bed sometime between 10 and 11 PM and I wake [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7157.52s)]
*  up around 6 AM. Okay. Yes, I can go to bed at nine and wake up at four, but I can't stick to that [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7163.280000000001s)]
*  schedule very long. My system just genetically is not wired for it. Some people are real night [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7169.12s)]
*  owls. They do best going to sleep at 2 AM and waking up at 10. They just feel better. Try a [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7173.599999999999s)]
*  couple of different schedules for at least three days. And then wherever you feel kind of most [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7178.48s)]
*  yourself, kind of like, you know, for me going to bed by 10 30 and waking up by six is kind of a [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7182.88s)]
*  natural antidepressant. When I sleep in and go to bed late, I start feeling off. Then I start abusing [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7187.76s)]
*  caffeine because I love caffeine, love, love, love caffeine. And I'm a big fan of caffeine. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7193.44s)]
*  But then I start abusing it. I start taking too much and then, you know, and then it, you know, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7199.04s)]
*  potentially can drift into other stimulants, you know, and then you're, then you're a mess. So, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7203.36s)]
*  but you know, some people do really well going to bed at eight 30 and waking up at 4 AM. But [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7208.08s)]
*  look, the world is not really wired for that. If you're going to have any kind of social life, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7212.88s)]
*  like Mark Wahlberg or something, he's always things like, I wake up at three. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7217.84s)]
*  Well, him and, and Ari Emanuel from WME, like, yeah, those guys are like the 4 AM club. They're [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7221.28s)]
*  like texting each other and like up. I get texts from Ari every once in a while. He's like, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7226.88s)]
*  up early, hyperbaric chamber, but he's, he, I mean, he's got like 12 cylinders. That guy's like, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7230.64s)]
*  go, go, go, go, go, go. And listen, some people need more sleep than others. I do great on six [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7235.6s)]
*  or six and a half. When I sleep eight, I actually feel more groggy. So if you get your schedule [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7239.76s)]
*  right, you don't need quite as much sleep. But before I came out here today, I did a half hour, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7245.36s)]
*  what I call, it's used to be called yoga nidra. It's non-sleep deep rest, NSDR. You just do long [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7249.84s)]
*  exhale breathing. You listen to a script, you relax your body. The data show you come out of that [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7255.12s)]
*  with your dopamine levels, 60% higher than you went into it. It replenishes your vigor. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7259.76s)]
*  Yoga nidra? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7264.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, yoga nidra or NSDR non-sleep deep rest. And these are zero cost tools, right? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7265.84s)]
*  So how many milligrams of caffeine are you taking a day? Are you usually taking a day for this? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7271.12s)]
*  Yeah. All right. A normal cup of coffee would be about 200 milligrams of strong coffee. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7275.68s)]
*  I consume about 800 milligrams of caffeine a day. I'm half Argentine. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7281.52s)]
*  Damn, you a damn firefly. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7286.64s)]
*  I drink yerba mate. A cold brew zero sugar yerba mate or I drink yerba mate alfagord. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7287.92s)]
*  If you're going to drink yerba mate, don't get the sugary kind. Nope. Get the loose leaf. No, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7293.68s)]
*  I have a yerba mate brand. It's not that one. Ours is Matina, which is, I'm not going to do [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7299.04s)]
*  a promotional here, but the point here is that if you like energy drinks, you like [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7303.92s)]
*  yerba mate, you like coffee. I'm like more power to you. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7308.4s)]
*  So there's 200 in a cup of coffee? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7311.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And what's in one of these? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7312.879999999999s)]
*  So there was actually a study just published on taurine that everyone's worried about, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7316.639999999999s)]
*  but that study was in vitro. I need to see a lot of data. There's a lot of data actually [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7319.28s)]
*  that taurine is beneficial for the heart and it has kind of an anti-aging thing. It's in, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7323.04s)]
*  you know, a lot of energy drinks. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7327.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. That's like a lysine in a taurine. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7328.719999999999s)]
*  Um, I love caffeine. I mean, man, caffeine and nicotine. I, right now I'm kind of easing back [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7330.879999999999s)]
*  on it. The delivery mechanism, you don't want to smoke vape, dipper snuff. You get cancer. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7338.24s)]
*  People go, well, vaping is not bad. Popcorn lung is real. People hate me for saying that [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7343.04s)]
*  vaping is bad. Not as bad as smoking. Vaping ain't good for you. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7347.839999999999s)]
*  And what flavor is the worst flavor? Any flavor? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7351.36s)]
*  It's all bad for you, man. But the gums and the pouches provided it's a low dose. It's [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7353.599999999999s)]
*  very habit forming, but you know, three to six milligrams or something on occasion. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7359.92s)]
*  This is the problem. People go to pretty soon. They're doing a whole canister a day. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7364.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. But I got a buddy got a mouthful of my buddy, like damn cotton, Joe over there. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7367.52s)]
*  Nicotine is a very interesting, um, drug because it's a stimulant, but it relaxes you too. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7373.52s)]
*  But it does cause, excuse me, vasoconstriction. And that's not good for all the stuff we were [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7379.12s)]
*  talking about earlier. You want blood flow to the brain and to your extremities, you know? [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7384.4800000000005s)]
*  And so some nicotine early in the day, little bit, no big deal with caffeine to get work done. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7389.52s)]
*  Remember effort that precedes dopamine in constructive areas of life, writing comedy, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7396.400000000001s)]
*  podcasting, school, sports, socializing in healthy ways. Like this is good. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7401.76s)]
*  Can you get just as much dopamine from doing those positive things as you can from doing things that [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7407.280000000001s)]
*  we would consider, you know, that off sometimes add a level of a disappointment or shame. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7411.4400000000005s)]
*  And maybe that's not the word I want to use. Yes, you can. It just, you need to be more [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7417.679999999999s)]
*  determined and focused on it. You know, remember it's how quickly the dopamine comes in with porn [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7424.48s)]
*  and methamphetamine, cocaine, and all of that. It's how quickly gambling raises dopamine. You [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7429.679999999999s)]
*  know, the stuff we're talking about work, focus, learning all that it's, it's work. I mean, it's, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7437.2s)]
*  it's hard work, but the effort that precedes dopamine is got completely different beast. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7442.32s)]
*  Because you're in control and it doesn't put you in the trough. But I did see a, you know, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7447.04s)]
*  I guess we don't call them tweets now. What do we call them on X some guy made a billion dollars [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7451.92s)]
*  and a couple of weeks later, he said, I don't know what's going on, but I feel like I'm [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7456.8s)]
*  sidely depressed. And I just said, that's dopamine. He got the reward and what he misses is the hunt. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7460.639999999999s)]
*  You have to stay in the hunt. This is like the will to live is the hunt for new things. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7468.08s)]
*  Ah, the will to live 31 year old guy who sells his startup for 100 million shares, why he is [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7473.04s)]
*  depressed and how to think about your career and life. I sold my company MVMT. I know that company [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7479.6s)]
*  that made watches, right? A few years ago for a lot of money and thought all my problems would be [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7486.4s)]
*  solved. I made my life really cushy and comfortable. I optimized for being as stress free as possible. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7490.72s)]
*  I play video games when I want, I wake up when I want and really have no reason to think out of, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7497.12s)]
*  get out of bed if I don't want to. I always thought this was a dream that I'd be happy forever. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7500.72s)]
*  I realize I'm in an incredibly unique situation and wanted to share some things I've learned [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7505.12s)]
*  and I'm still working through. I mean, for you, you know, and forgive me, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7509.280000000001s)]
*  I've been monologuing a bit because I just want to make sure I blast through some of this info that [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7514.400000000001s)]
*  hopefully people can make to use. But I, you know, for you, right, you've got the podcast, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7518.320000000001s)]
*  you do your comedy tours, you know, I'm not a comedian, but I love going to see live comedy. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7523.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's fun. And I just have to imagine that staying busy in pursuit has got to be [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7528.4s)]
*  super important to your overall wellbeing. What's funny you say it. I think it's like, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7535.44s)]
*  yeah, I didn't know that I liked to work really, you know, I mean, I knew that I was persistent [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7540.799999999999s)]
*  maybe and I liked comedy, but then like, as other things have started to arise and like [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7545.839999999999s)]
*  learning a podcast and then you're running a business and then, you know, I, I like to work, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7551.04s)]
*  you know, I really enjoy it. I think I'm probably competitive in some ways. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7556.48s)]
*  Do you have a, you don't, I'm not going to ask you to tell us, but do you have a couple of [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7561.44s)]
*  comedians in your mind that like, you're like, I can, I can best that or is it besting against [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7564.879999999999s)]
*  yourself? Oh no, I think it's just, can you still make yourself laugh? That's my thing. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7569.44s)]
*  Is that what's your writing? I'm very curious about this. What's your writing process? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7573.919999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'll talk to somebody. Usually I'm telling, I'm trying to talk with a gal and entertain her [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7577.36s)]
*  or talk with one of my buddies and entertain them. And there's something that'll get said. That's [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7581.5199999999995s)]
*  just kind of like, Oh, that's perfect, man. So that's kind of how I'll do it. And then I'll put [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7585.2s)]
*  it on a stage from there, you know, and I'll record my sets and, and I've started to put some of them [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7590.24s)]
*  into like chat, GPT or AI. So it can like, show me what was new during this one to the last one [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7595.92s)]
*  and learn little intricacies and things like that, things that worked and things that changed. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7600.48s)]
*  Do you get ideas in your dreams? Do you ever wake up laughing? [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7604.32s)]
*  Ayahuasca. I've gotten ideas. I've gotten, I got like some good bits. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7607.2s)]

*  DMT work. Wow. And Nolan has discovered there are these changes in brain errors, like the [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7637.92s)]
*  Insula, which are involved in kind of self-reflection bottle, self-body relationship, [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7643.04s)]
*  all sorts of things. The data from those studies are incredible. I mean, these tier one operators, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7648.16s)]
*  you know, which is code for have to be ready in 24 hours to go overseas and [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7654.48s)]

*  dependent on alcohol, drugs, and other substances that go down there and do it once or twice [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7664.24s)]
*  and never even feel the desire to use again. It's just striking. Yeah. The Ibogaine sounds amazing. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7669.200000000001s)]
*  I also hear it's terrifying. A couple of those guys told me and they, and they have a high bar [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7675.6s)]
*  for this. A couple of those guys have told me it is the most terrifying experience of their entire [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7680.320000000001s)]
*  life, but also brought them the most amount of peace. Well, it's 22 hours psychedelic journey [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7684.64s)]
*  followed by DMT. Are you asleep during it? No, you're awake. And what I hear is that you don't [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7689.84s)]
*  hallucinate when your eyes are open, but when you close your eyes, you get high definition recall [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7694.96s)]
*  of previous experiences, but you have agency. You can act differently in there and rewire. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7700.16s)]
*  I've never done it. I'm very curious to, I've never done ayahuasca. I have had some incredibly [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7704.72s)]
*  beneficial clinical experiences with MDMA and with psilocybin. And it's just complete. I was, [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7709.12s)]
*  you know, I don't encourage kids to do it, but you need a really good practitioner. You have to [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7716.56s)]
*  find a way to do it legally. And there are ways, but man, it is a game changer. A lot of bootleg [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7720.4s)]
*  stuff going on out there, but I do think that, yeah, it's like getting back to nature, getting [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7725.36s)]
*  back through it. And literally you're getting back to the roots of like, what will, what can [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7728.5599999999995s)]
*  reorganize. I think the nature inside of us that gets so rattled by us maneuvering it and existing [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7733.759999999999s)]
*  in the world. I don't know how we manage to damage our own nature so much over time. Well, maybe it's, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7740.16s)]
*  instead of saying lesbians will save us all, it's lesbians and psychedelics will save us all. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7744.639999999999s)]
*  That's kind of my new campaign. Look at this guy right here. That's Rick Rubin. That's, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7749.84s)]
*  you know, what I was saying earlier, you know, that's me when it comes to being able to see [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7756.08s)]
*  clearly along certain dimensions of life. But that's when you come to rely on good friends [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7759.68s)]
*  and you do your inner journey work and figure it out. Yeah. I mean, I think it's fascinating. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7765.04s)]
*  And I think just the fact that we can get, this thing is awesome. How'd y'all get that? [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7771.68s)]
*  Just chat, GPT. Oh, it's so great. Cock a monkey blindfolded on LSD. Yeah. Sometimes I've looked at [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7778.16s)]
*  decisions I've made in my life and go, you know, I pretty much had the clarity that that guy right [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7785.12s)]
*  there had. Yeah. And, uh, but in other areas of my life, like the decision to go into skateboarding [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7790.08s)]
*  and leave the decision to pursue science and then podcasting and, you know, my life's a dream, man. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7794.96s)]
*  Yeah. Like I can't tell you, like, you know, people will think I'm just trying to puff you up, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7800.4s)]
*  but like to be sitting here talking to you, I'm a fan to be able to explore ideas and to learn from [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7805.36s)]
*  such a diverse array of people. Like I love talking to scientists, but I love talking to [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7812.32s)]
*  comedians and creatives and like my childhood hero became one of my best friends because he [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7817.2s)]
*  heard the podcast and really, yeah. My, I mean, it's kind of embarrassing to say, but Tim Armstrong, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7824.48s)]
*  the singer for rancid and the transplants, he has that band with Rob Aston and Travis Barker. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7829.44s)]
*  Tim's like my hero and we've become very good friends. He's a, he's a real life poet. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7834.72s)]
*  He's an incredible musician. He's produced a ton of music for others. He's a very, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7840.32s)]
*  you know, soft spoken, he's, he's a true music producer and performer. That's fascinating. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7844.32s)]
*  And he, we became, he's one of my best friends. Like me and David Spade, I just can't even believe [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7852.32s)]
*  that we're buddies. And then I get to like ask him about stuff or even listen to him, tell jokes [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7856.48s)]
*  over dinner at like, yeah, sometimes things like that, like not to name drop, but yeah, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7860.8s)]
*  it just blows your mind. Some of the people you'll get to come across, you know? [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7865.6s)]
*  Well, and for people listening, I, I, you know, I have to say like I used to watch and, you know, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7868.64s)]
*  watch things and read and listen to podcasts and like, I wanted to be part of it, but like being [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7874.56s)]
*  myself and that's really the key. Rick always says this. He's like the way to succeed in any genre [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7880.320000000001s)]
*  that you're interested in is to be you. Cause no one's done that yet. The moment you try and be [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7884.96s)]
*  like the other guy, you know, or the other gal is when it falls flat. Right. The reason Tony Hawk's [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7888.96s)]
*  Tony Hawk is cause he's a pioneer and he just kept going. There's only one of him, you know? [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7895.28s)]
*  And there are others in skateboarding and others in podcasting, but like, like it's like that trust [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7899.84s)]
*  in, in self, you just have to, if you just show up you and do your personal work too, I do think, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7905.36s)]
*  you know, journaling, meditation, working out. Yeah. Like you, and you just show that you just [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7911.6s)]
*  show up you. So like, you know, I think we got the answer to your initial question. Why is podcasting [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7917.12s)]
*  what it is is because like we just show up. We didn't have a, we didn't have a template. There's [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7922.4s)]
*  no script, nothing. We just show up and a couple of guys in their closets, man. We're talking about [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7925.92s)]
*  finger lengths and lesbians and monkeys on LSD and measles vaccine and some of the biggest issues in [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7930.32s)]
*  public health. And, and you know, your name was mentioned in, in, in a moment of praise at the [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7935.599999999999s)]
*  inauguration of the president of the United States. Yeah, that's crazy. We are living. I don't think [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7942.32s)]
*  we're living in a simulation. I think what's so awesome about this life is it's real. Not that [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7947.36s)]
*  it's fake. It's all the, it's all the shit that's real. It blows my mind. And just, I think what you, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7952.96s)]
*  what you, what you can be called upon to be a part of, you know, and taking agency, having some more [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7958.4s)]
*  agency, the biggest thing I noticed in my life is how do I get to know myself better and get to [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7963.599999999999s)]
*  utilize myself better and not just for me, but for like, uh, and really to listen to God better. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7968.4s)]
*  How do I learn to have a relationship with something that's bigger than me so that I can [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7973.44s)]
*  get better direction, you know, in better, um, and better peace at times, because God's not just there [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7977.759999999999s)]
*  for direction. I believe, I believe that he's also there, uh, for reflection and for rest, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7983.36s)]
*  you know, and just to be able to, you know, I don't know. Do you pray every day? I pray every [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7989.36s)]
*  day. Yeah, me too. I'm, I'm a scientist, but I'm a believer. You know, I've always believed in God [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=7994.96s)]
*  and I used to hide praying because I grew up in a complicated home religiously for different, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8000.4800000000005s)]
*  we've got a real mixed family, but also like the attitudes about religion, very mixed, some very [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8005.36s)]
*  positive, some not positive. But a few years ago, a friend of mine, who was a former tier one operator [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8010.08s)]
*  and he's run some of my security stuff, like he encouraged me to start reading the Bible. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8014.96s)]
*  I was like, wow, there's so much wisdom here. And then he encouraged me to start praying. And it's, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8019.52s)]
*  I know people are going to, some people roll their eyes. Some people will be like, get it. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8024.72s)]
*  I mean, when you start praying before sleeping in the morning, yeah, I prayed right before I came [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8027.6s)]
*  in here in the bathroom. I literally get on my knees and pray before anything important this [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8032.88s)]
*  morning at night. And you know, people, how can be a scientist and believe in, in God? And it's like, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8037.4400000000005s)]
*  well, easy because as a scientist, you learn that like, even as a, let's just say a vision scientist, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8042.4s)]
*  there are animals that can see parts of the visual spectrum that we can't see. UV light, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8049.5199999999995s)]
*  infrared light, pit vipers can see it. Mosquitoes see things we don't see. So the moment you start [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8054.639999999999s)]
*  just thinking, wait, our human brain can understand and make sense of certain things, but not others [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8059.04s)]
*  through logic and reasoning and emotion. You go, well, there's this not just possibility of an [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8064.96s)]
*  entire set of energies out there that we're not aware of. It's absolutely certain. And then you [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8071.12s)]
*  go, well, that's a big leap to the idea that there's a guy or, you know, and his son is the, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8075.68s)]
*  you know, is, you know, is Christ and Christ was resurrected. But when you start reading the [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8080.240000000001s)]
*  stories and you start like looking at our real world experience, you go, you know, so much of [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8085.76s)]
*  this makes sense. And it doesn't make nature and science any less interesting. It makes it more [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8091.12s)]
*  interesting. It makes it more important. It's like we're here. I believe that we're here to like [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8096.320000000001s)]
*  access that energy, allow it come through us. Yeah. I don't, I don't think like we podcast, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8104.0s)]
*  I think energy comes through us and we podcast. Oh, I think the funnest thing sometimes is like [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8108.96s)]
*  getting an idea. Cause I'm like, this didn't come from me. Right. What the hell am I doing? I'm just [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8113.5199999999995s)]
*  like something out here that's trying to position myself to be the best receptor. It's almost like [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8118.4s)]
*  when you're trying to like put those dog ears out for a television or whatever, like an old black [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8122.4s)]
*  and white TV, you're trying to pick up the signal. It's like, I'm just trying to best get myself in [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8126.799999999999s)]
*  situation to receive a decent signal. Do you believe sorry to yesterday, I was in a conversation [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8132.32s)]
*  with a Stanford and Harvard trained psychiatrist, one of the smartest people I know. And he said to [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8138.24s)]
*  me, he said, you know, he's him talking, he said, you know, I believe in miracles. He's like, there [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8142.16s)]
*  are miracles. And I was like, really? And he explained a case of a patient, like there is no [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8148.0s)]
*  way this person should still be alive, let alone flourishing as they are the number of things that [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8153.28s)]
*  had to organize for that to work out. And, you know, so I'm kind of obsessed these days with like [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8157.5199999999995s)]
*  this notion of miracles. Oh, I love that. Have you considered, cause we, we will sometimes interview [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8162.879999999999s)]
*  people who have had a miracle experience happen to them. And it's really fascinating sometimes just [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8166.96s)]
*  to hear some of their stories. It's something I would like to do more. One of the things I want [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8170.96s)]
*  to do is just, I want to come over to your pod, man. Next time I'm in town and we can do this again. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8174.96s)]
*  Sometimes we, I feel like we only got to talk about a few things, but that's perfect. It'll give us [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8179.44s)]
*  more stuff to talk about in the future. And just thank you, Andrew, for just being a good voice. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8182.639999999999s)]
*  You have a lot to say and you share information well. And it's like, I think we're at a time where [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8187.04s)]
*  people just need to have information that isn't compromised by like a bank or an advertiser that's [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8191.2s)]
*  telling someone they have to speak a certain way, you know, unless it's an advertisement where [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8197.28s)]
*  you're reading for Tacovia's or for a liquid IV or something, you know, but yeah, thank you for [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8200.24s)]

*  like put people in a box and people really, people really feel your heart in everything you do. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8224.32s)]
*  And it, in part, it's the vulnerability. It's also when you, when you say like the hell with that and [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8230.8s)]
*  really stretch your wings, the way you've developed this incredible expertise at the various things you [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxHktBHVY5I&t=8235.439999999999s)]
