*  That's a pretty good guess, about 1800. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=355.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  So there are a hundred members of the Senate [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=357.68s)]
*  and 435 members of the House. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  Got it? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=362.24s)]
*  535. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  And you got 1800 lobbyists. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=364.6s)]
*  Well-paid, former leaders of the Democratic Party, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  leaders of the Republican Party. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  They're there to say, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=371.12s)]
*  hey, Congress, do everything you can to make sure [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  we make as much money as possible [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=375.0s)]
*  and who gives a damn whether people can afford [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=376.88s)]
*  the prescription drugs they need. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=378.68s)]
*  So that's power. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=380.16s)]
*  So you have a whole other drug government almost going on. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=383.88s)]
*  That's even bigger than our own government. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=384.72s)]
*  Well, not big, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=387.4s)]
*  that's about what we could define what we mean by bigger. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=389.24s)]
*  But that's fair. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=391.56s)]
*  But if you look at Wall Street, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=392.52s)]
*  the power of Wall Street, the drug companies, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=394.68s)]
*  the insurance companies, the fossil fuel industry, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=397.12s)]
*  you have enormous wealth, enormous power. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=400.08s)]
*  And if your question is, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=402.32s)]
*  is it government that tells them what to do [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=404.44s)]
*  or they tell what the government to do, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=406.36s)]
*  more or the latter, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=408.64s)]
*  they tell the government what to do. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=410.0s)]
*  Very powerful. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=411.8s)]
*  Does it feel like that's changed over your time [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=412.68s)]
*  in politics or has it always been that way? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=415.36s)]
*  I think to some degree, money talks, right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=418.2s)]
*  No great secret, that's always been the case. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=420.88s)]
*  It's worse now and I'll tell you why. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=422.68s)]
*  As a result of this Citizens United Supreme Court decision, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=425.16s)]
*  you're familiar with that? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=429.6s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=430.6s)]
*  So people brought action, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=431.68s)]
*  billionaires really brought action. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  They said, hey, it's undemocratic, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=434.0s)]
*  you're taking away my freedom of speech, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=436.04s)]
*  I had a First Amendment right, we're on TV now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=438.2s)]
*  You could say whatever you want to say, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=441.8s)]
*  and I'm a billionaire. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=443.32s)]
*  And I want to spend unlimited sums of money [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=444.72s)]
*  to defeat this candidate or support this candidate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=447.36s)]
*  And you have laws on the book side [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=449.96s)]
*  which restrict my freedom to buy the election. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=451.48s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=454.6s)]
*  100%. Okay. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=455.44s)]
*  And Supreme Court said, well guys, you're right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=456.76s)]
*  You're billionaires, you should be able to spend [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=459.12s)]
*  as much money as you want to buy elections. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=460.56s)]
*  And that's what you have. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=463.92s)]
*  So right now, this is literally the truth. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=464.88s)]
*  You have super PACs where billionaires [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=467.2s)]
*  can put unlimited amounts of money, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=470.24s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  to defeat people they don't like [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=474.16s)]
*  or to support people they do like. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=475.88000000000005s)]
*  That's power. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=478.24s)]
*  And that is a corruption of what democracy is supposed to be. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  Look, you and I can disagree on an issue, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=482.56s)]
*  10 people. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  We argue it out, we vote. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=485.92s)]
*  I get the majority, you get the majority. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=487.64000000000004s)]
*  Somebody wins, somebody loses. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think billionaires should be able to buy elections. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=491.36s)]
*  And I think most people think that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  Most people are like, why are corporations [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  or companies allowed to like give money to candidates [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=498.56s)]
*  and influence elections, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=502.48s)]
*  Almost every person I know says that that should be no. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=505.0s)]
*  Whose responsibility is it to make sure it doesn't happen? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=508.24s)]
*  Is it ours or is it the politicians? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=510.4s)]
*  What happened is there were laws put in place, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=512.76s)]
*  not as strong as I would like, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=515.96s)]
*  which did limit the power of big money, okay? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=517.92s)]
*  And what that Supreme Court decision said [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=521.52s)]
*  is what Congress did was unconstitutional, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=523.36s)]
*  denied big money, their freedom of speech. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=525.68s)]
*  If you're a billionaire, you have freedom of speech. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  That means you can run ads all over the day [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  and to beat Bernie Sanders, beat anybody. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=533.16s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=536.48s)]
*  So what we have got to do now is once again, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=537.4s)]
*  pass legislation that will do that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=540.84s)]
*  Are there politicians that aren't viable kind of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=544.88s)]
*  or aren't influenced by lobbyists? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=550.52s)]
*  Of course there are. There are. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=552.2s)]
*  There are, yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=553.04s)]
*  I think there's some very good people. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=553.88s)]
*  But many people, look, just to run an example, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=555.64s)]
*  you're running for election, okay? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=559.04s)]
*  Your opponent is spending millions of dollars, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=561.24s)]
*  and these TV ads are up there, all right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=563.8000000000001s)]
*  You think you're gonna stand up [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=565.24s)]
*  to powerful special interests who say, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=567.44s)]
*  you know, Theo, listen, I like you, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  but you're gonna take that position on that issue. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=571.24s)]
*  I gotta be running millions of dollars of ads against you. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=573.4000000000001s)]
*  What do you think you're gonna do [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=575.96s)]
*  if you wanna get elected? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=577.32s)]
*  You could say, well, go to hell. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=578.32s)]
*  I'm gonna do it anyhow, and many would do. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=579.94s)]
*  Or you run the risk of seeing [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  that kind of money come against you. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=585.12s)]
*  Or you then have to find a lobbyist [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  that has an interest of yours [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=588.88s)]
*  and you have to try and fight back. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=590.0s)]
*  Which is a pretty pathetic thing, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=591.32s)]
*  To some degree, which I have right now, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=593.72s)]
*  it's a funny kind of thing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=595.32s)]
*  Let's say you were running against me. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=597.44s)]
*  It's not you against me. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  It's your moneyed interest versus my moneyed interest. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=599.8000000000001s)]
*  That's what super PACs are. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=603.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, corporations cannot directly contribute [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=605.08s)]
*  to your campaign, but they, big money interests, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  billionaires, can contribute to a super PAC. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=610.2800000000001s)]
*  So you have all these, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=613.2s)]
*  I would say to you, people who watch the show here, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=614.6800000000001s)]
*  look at the ads that are on television. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=617.44s)]
*  They'll be underneath it, you'll see, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=619.12s)]
*  paid for by supporters of the American way of life [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=620.68s)]
*  or whatever the hell it is. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  Understand that in most cases, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=625.8s)]
*  these are billionaires putting money into a candidate. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=627.28s)]
*  So the super PAC is kind of the loophole. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=630.4s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  Is how they do it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=633.16s)]
*  So it's not directly from there. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=633.98s)]
*  Exactly, there are limits. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=634.8199999999999s)]
*  All right, you wanted to contribute to my campaign. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=636.28s)]
*  They're pretty stringent limits. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  You can't contribute, I think it's, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=639.3s)]
*  I don't know, it's 5,000 bucks. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=640.64s)]
*  Through a super PAC, you can contribute $100 million. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=642.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=646.08s)]
*  That's a big issue. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=647.48s)]
*  We don't talk about it enough. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=648.64s)]
*  And then you can understand [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=649.8s)]
*  that if you're an ordinary person, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=652.68s)]
*  who's gonna listen to your interests, your needs, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=655.76s)]
*  When billionaires are putting in this kind of money. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=659.4s)]
*  Right, if the best I can help you out with is 5,000 bucks, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=661.0s)]
*  you might show up and shake my hand, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=663.9599999999999s)]
*  but when something really, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=665.3399999999999s)]
*  when the rickshaw hits the road or whatever, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  you're gonna be working for the big dogs for the cash. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  You got it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  And that's the way the system works. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=672.74s)]
*  And how do we change that? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, this campaign finance reform [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=676.04s)]
*  is a big deal, just this one issue. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=678.28s)]
*  And I'm glad you raised it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  We gotta do away with the citizens unit. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=681.12s)]
*  We have to have restrictions, okay? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=682.76s)]
*  When I ran for president, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=684.9s)]
*  the average contribution was $27, okay? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=686.16s)]
*  Roughly speaking. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=690.12s)]
*  And we've got millions of people to contribute. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=691.04s)]
*  So I think there has to be a real stringent limit [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=693.6s)]
*  on the amount of money that any individual [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=696.12s)]
*  can put into the political process. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=698.48s)]
*  And I also believe that we should move [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=700.4s)]
*  to what we call public funding of elections. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=701.92s)]
*  You're a candidate, you wanna run for governor, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=704.1999999999999s)]
*  you wanna run for senator. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  If you show that you have a certain amount of support, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=707.96s)]
*  you got X number of thousands of people [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=710.44s)]
*  willing to put $5 into your campaign, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=712.48s)]
*  you can be able to get public funding [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  and there's a limit at how much you can spend. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=717.2s)]
*  These are not radical ideas. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  They exist in many countries around the world actually. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=720.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty normal. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=722.72s)]
*  Do you think that our election process is still democratic? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=725.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you think it's still? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=728.32s)]
*  Yes and no. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=730.58s)]
*  I mean, you wanna run for office, can you? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  You got a certain number of signatures. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=736.04s)]
*  But if you're gonna win and I have 10 times more money [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=738.0s)]
*  than you do, I will beat you 95% of the time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=740.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=743.28s)]
*  I mean, that's a fact, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=744.12s)]
*  Right, 100%. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=744.96s)]
*  You'll beat me, maybe if you're really an exceptional [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=745.8s)]
*  candidate and I'm a real idiot, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=747.64s)]
*  you will beat me once in a while. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=749.2s)]
*  But by and large, money people will win. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=750.4s)]
*  So if you're asking me, are we a democracy, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=753.16s)]
*  in one sense we are. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=755.48s)]
*  All right, you can run for office, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=756.92s)]
*  you can raise your issues. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=758.12s)]
*  On the other hand, in terms of who has the real power, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=759.52s)]
*  money people do and I use the term oligarchy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=762.44s)]
*  And oligarchy is a society where small numbers [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=766.2800000000001s)]
*  of very wealthy people control the economic [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  and political life of the country. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=772.48s)]
*  I think we are moving rapidly in that direction. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=774.12s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's, to me it feels like [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=777.48s)]
*  a almost privatized communism in a way. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=778.84s)]
*  Right, that's a very good point. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=781.36s)]
*  It's a very good, it's an interesting way of looking at it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=783.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know exactly sometimes everything [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=786.36s)]
*  of what communism is and what socialism is, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  but sometimes that's how it feels. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=790.36s)]
*  Well, let me give you an example. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=792.48s)]
*  Let me pick, can I pick up on your point? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=793.32s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=794.64s)]
*  Okay, I believe we are the only nation on earth, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=795.48s)]
*  major nation, wealthy nation, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=799.88s)]
*  that does not guarantee healthcare to all people, okay? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=801.72s)]
*  Get in your car, go 50 miles where you are sitting right now [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=804.84s)]
*  in Burlington, Vermont. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=807.36s)]
*  You have a terrible automobile accident. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=808.96s)]
*  You're in the hospital for a month in Canada. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=810.6s)]
*  You know what the bill is when you come out? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=813.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=816.72s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  You know how much the Canadians spend per person [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=818.6s)]
*  on healthcare compared to us? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=820.76s)]
*  One half as much. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=822.4s)]
*  They spend half as much, you don't take out your wallet [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  if you get sick, you're the doctor that you want, okay? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=828.0s)]
*  I believe in that type of system. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=830.68s)]
*  They guarantee healthcare to all of their people. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  It's publicly funded the way we fund police departments, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=834.9599999999999s)]
*  fire departments, and libraries, okay? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=838.04s)]
*  You gotta pay taxes for it, but at the end of the day, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=839.84s)]
*  it is less expensive for your healthcare. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  You follow what I'm saying? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=844.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=845.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=846.6s)]
*  You're a proponent for healthcare for all, right? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=848.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=850.4000000000001s)]
*  Yes, and you always have been. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=851.24s)]
*  But how, the system seems, that system seems so rigged [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=853.7600000000001s)]
*  because you have, like one of the number one causes [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  of bankruptcy in America is medical debt, right? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=861.44s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  Like people can't, you know, people, they go in, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=866.6800000000001s)]
*  they don't even know the cost. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=870.8800000000001s)]
*  They sign an agreement that they're gonna be billed later, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=871.8800000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=874.32s)]
*  And then they get the bill and it's astronomical [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=875.56s)]
*  and they spend the rest of their life, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=877.88s)]
*  literally a slave to the healthcare system [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=880.12s)]
*  or to the medical billing system or the insu, you know, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=883.64s)]
*  dealing with their insurance and not to mention they're sick. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=886.68s)]
*  So the added stress of that, it just feels like, yeah, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=889.3199999999999s)]
*  like something so much better could be done. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=893.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, that is so pathetic and so sick and so cruel. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=895.88s)]
*  I mean, we did a hearing on this and roughly speaking, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  and I know the viewers will think this is like [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=903.88s)]
*  hard to believe. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=906.08s)]
*  Half of the people who are dealing with cancer, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=908.72s)]
*  now cancer is a terrible disease, right? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  Your point. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=912.4s)]
*  100%. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=913.24s)]
*  You're struggling for your life, right? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=914.0600000000001s)]
*  Bad, yeah, bad. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=914.9s)]
*  Maybe you make it, maybe you don't, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=915.74s)]
*  you got radiation, chemotherapy, bad stuff, right? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  Half the people who get cancer treatment [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=920.36s)]
*  either end up in bankruptcy or utilizing all [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=923.8000000000001s)]
*  of the financial resources of the family. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=928.28s)]
*  They're depleted, they're broke. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=930.1600000000001s)]
*  So imagine that, you go into the hospital, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=931.6s)]
*  doctors, it's zero, sorry, you got cancer, terrible. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=933.76s)]
*  You're worried to death, right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=936.08s)]
*  Your friends, your family are worried. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=937.24s)]
*  And then on top of that, what are you worried about? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=938.92s)]
*  Oh my God, what, I'm gonna have to sell my house? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=940.96s)]
*  Or I have to go bankrupt in order to pay medical bills. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=943.96s)]
*  That is insane. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=946.64s)]
*  And it adds, if you're trying to deal with cancer, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=948.32s)]
*  then you gotta worry about financial stress. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=950.36s)]
*  Think it's gonna make your condition any better? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=952.6s)]
*  No, the worst. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=954.24s)]
*  You spend half your day, you can't even, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=955.24s)]
*  in the insurance companies, it's all a rigmarole, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=956.6s)]
*  it's constant stress. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=958.6800000000001s)]
*  But how is it set up like that? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=960.72s)]
*  What is the gimmick between insurers and the hospital? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=963.52s)]
*  What's the, that's the thing I don't know. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=967.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=969.08s)]
*  Take it a step, let's take a step further. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  Let me talk about the Canadian system, all right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=972.0s)]
*  Simple system. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=974.0400000000001s)]
*  You pay taxes. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=975.52s)]
*  And progressive, the more you make, the more you pay. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=977.0s)]
*  But everyone pays taxes, all right. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=979.4000000000001s)]
*  End result is you walk into the hospital, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=981.1600000000001s)]
*  you sign your name, you have all the treatment you need. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=982.84s)]
*  And it's good quality healthcare. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=984.96s)]
*  You don't have to argue with insurance companies. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  You get the care that the doctors think you need. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=989.1600000000001s)]
*  End of discussion. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=992.12s)]
*  And in my view, that's the way it should be. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=994.32s)]
*  We spend, it's not just that the insurance companies [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  make huge profits, they do. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=999.84s)]
*  Not just they pay their CEOs whose orbit and salaries, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1001.5600000000001s)]
*  which they do. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1004.72s)]
*  Everybody's gotta fill out a thousand different forms, right? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1006.08s)]
*  Goes crazy filling out forms to see what you're entitled to, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  what you're not entitled to, deductibles, right? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1011.76s)]
*  Yeah, the bureaucracy, it's ridiculous. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1014.2800000000001s)]
*  Is that called bureaucracy? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1015.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what it is. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1017.2s)]
*  All right, so look, you may have health insurance, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1018.48s)]
*  I just talked to a person the other day, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1021.72s)]
*  we had a meeting, you know what their deductible was? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1022.96s)]
*  $13,000, what does that mean? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1025.56s)]
*  It means that the first $13,000 of illness, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1028.44s)]
*  they gotta pay out of their own pocket. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1031.96s)]
*  How many people can make $13,000? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1033.48s)]
*  So if you get hit by a truck [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1035.36s)]
*  and you earn up a million dollar bill, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1036.56s)]
*  yeah, the insurance companies will kick in, presumably. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1037.88s)]
*  All right, so the whole idea that healthcare in America, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1041.0s)]
*  unlike every other major country, all right, go to Europe, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1045.52s)]
*  go to Canada, go to many Latin American countries, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1048.84s)]
*  it is a bloody right, not a privilege, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1051.48s)]
*  and that's what I think it should be. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1054.52s)]
*  So we have a system that works very well [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1056.04s)]
*  for the insurance companies and the drug companies. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1058.8s)]
*  In some cases, you're gonna pay 10 times more [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1061.6s)]
*  for medication in America than they do in other countries. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  That's a whole other story [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  we're trying to deal with right now. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1067.72s)]
*  But it's a corrupt system benefiting the people who own it, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1069.4399999999998s)]
*  not the ordinary American. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1072.72s)]
*  You go out on the street, go out on the street, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1073.72s)]
*  say to people, do you think healthcare is a human right? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  All people in America shout out, yeah, we do. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1077.68s)]
*  That's what I'm fighting for. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1080.2s)]
*  Who are the lobbyists that are against that then? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1081.72s)]
*  Who do you think? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1083.92s)]
*  Guys from the insurance companies and the drug companies. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1084.96s)]
*  Okay, and then what politicians work with those? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1087.08s)]
*  Like, why don't we know what politicians are cheating us [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1089.12s)]
*  so that we don't have them in anymore? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1092.52s)]
*  All right, you're a smart guy. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1094.4s)]
*  You tell me, how often have you heard a discussion [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1096.08s)]
*  in this country about how broken the healthcare system is [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1099.88s)]
*  in comparing it to other countries? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1104.16s)]
*  A lot. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1105.88s)]
*  All right, you've heard a lot about this? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1107.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think I hear a lot about, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1108.68s)]
*  I look into it a lot. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  You look into it, but how many people even know [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1111.64s)]
*  that we are the only major country on Earth [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1114.28s)]
*  not to guarantee healthcare to all people? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1116.0800000000002s)]
*  So when people say, oh, Bernie Sanders is a radical idea. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1117.6000000000001s)]
*  He thinks everybody should have healthcare. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1122.2s)]
*  That exists in Canada, it's in France, in England, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  in Denmark, in Sweden, in every bloody country on Earth, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1126.16s)]
*  virtually, rich country. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1129.2s)]
*  So it's not a radical idea. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  Even Mars, I heard they have healthcare there now. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1131.92s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1133.92s)]
*  Now, some people would say that the argument against that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1136.52s)]
*  would be that then there's less personal responsibility [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1138.76s)]
*  to take care of yourself, right? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1141.72s)]
*  But do you... [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1143.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1145.48s)]
*  But that would be in other countries anyway, right? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1146.4s)]
*  That would be in anywhere. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1148.84s)]
*  If God forbid, you or I came down [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1150.16s)]
*  with a serious illicit mark, am I gonna blame you [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1151.84s)]
*  for coming down with cancer? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1153.84s)]
*  I mean, is that a personal responsibility? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1155.96s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1158.44s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1159.84s)]
*  That might just be kind of a ghost of an argument. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1160.68s)]
*  But to pick up on that point, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1164.92s)]
*  what should one of the priorities [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1167.32s)]
*  of a good healthcare system be? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1169.32s)]
*  It should be to try to keep people healthy. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1170.92s)]
*  So we should encourage people to have good diet, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1173.4s)]
*  to do exercise, to stay away from addictive stuff, right? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1175.52s)]
*  We do a particularly good job on that? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1179.96s)]
*  Not so much, because where do the insurance companies [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1181.4s)]
*  make their money? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1183.76s)]
*  Hey, if you're really sick, pretty good. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1184.68s)]
*  We keep you healthy, not so much. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1188.28s)]
*  Are they one of the largest lobbyist groups? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1191.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1194.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1195.04s)]
*  Very, very, they're huge. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1195.86s)]
*  I mean, we started this discussion, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1196.84s)]
*  you talk about privatized communism, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1198.92s)]
*  whatever the expression you used, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1201.36s)]
*  is I believe that Medicare is the health insurance program [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1203.68s)]
*  for the elderly, Medicaid is for lower income people. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1208.64s)]
*  I think we should combine all these [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1212.0s)]
*  and guarantee healthcare to all people. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1213.32s)]
*  But your point is that in the private sector, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1215.8s)]
*  we are moving to a monopoly, and it's true. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1218.52s)]
*  People like UnitedHealth, unbelievable, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1222.52s)]
*  UnitedHealth to the best of my knowledge, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1225.36s)]
*  has under contract or hires 10% of the doctors in America. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1228.24s)]
*  Got that? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1234.08s)]
*  One insurance company. One company. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1234.9199999999998s)]
*  10% of the doctors. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1235.84s)]
*  And so how would you even start to undo something like that? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1237.3999999999999s)]
*  Like what's a realistic path to reform, I guess? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1240.08s)]
*  Thanks, great question. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1243.6799999999998s)]
*  Because I wrote the bill, I know the answer. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1245.2s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1247.32s)]
*  Right now you have Medicare, which is very popular program. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1248.84s)]
*  It's life-saving to many elderly people. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1252.48s)]
*  That was developed in the 1960s by President Lyndon Johnson. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1254.6s)]
*  Okay, very popular program. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1258.24s)]
*  You got Medicaid for the lower income people, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  also a popular program. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1261.24s)]
*  What I would do is over a four-year period, take Medicare. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1263.32s)]
*  First thing you do is expand Medicare, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1267.1999999999998s)]
*  because Medicare does not now cover dental, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1270.28s)]
*  hearing or vision. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1273.8s)]
*  A lot of people can't afford to go to a dentist. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1275.6s)]
*  Got me? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1277.84s)]
*  You expand it. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1279.4s)]
*  And then you say right now to be eligible for Medicare, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1280.5600000000002s)]
*  you got to be 65 years of age. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1283.16s)]
*  First year lower to 55. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1285.6000000000001s)]
*  So you have 57, congratulations. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1287.52s)]
*  You don't have to worry about [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1289.88s)]
*  whether you have insurance on your job. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1291.0s)]
*  You want to hear something else crazy [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1292.52s)]
*  about the private insurance system. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1293.8400000000001s)]
*  You work for a big corporation, okay? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1296.5600000000002s)]

*  That's pretty crazy. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1304.48s)]
*  Where you work determines the kind of healthcare you get. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1305.3200000000002s)]
*  Anyhow, so we go from 65 down to 55. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1307.16s)]
*  55 next year down to 45. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  45 to 35, fourth year you cover everybody. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1313.2s)]
*  Gradual absorption. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1316.28s)]
*  So you have a Medicare system that covers all people. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  You no longer have to pay any more deductibles [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1322.8400000000001s)]
*  or co-payments, no more premiums. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1327.2s)]
*  You get your healthcare because you're an American citizen. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1330.1200000000001s)]
*  Will your taxes go up? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  They may. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1334.52s)]
*  Will it be less than what you pay right now [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1335.46s)]
*  in private insurance? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1338.22s)]
*  Yes, it will be, it's a good deal. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1339.3400000000001s)]
*  Can we afford that as a country, you think? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1340.8600000000001s)]
*  True. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1342.7s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1343.52s)]
*  We are now spending over $4 trillion on healthcare. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1344.3600000000001s)]
*  We spend double. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1347.1000000000001s)]
*  Here's another point to be made. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1348.02s)]
*  We spend twice as much per person on healthcare [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1349.8600000000001s)]
*  as any other country. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1352.26s)]
*  Because it's designed to make money [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1353.46s)]
*  for the insurance companies and the drug companies. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1354.78s)]
*  Wait, so explain that to me. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1356.5s)]
*  So we spend twice as much on healthcare. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1357.3400000000001s)]
*  We are spending right now. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1359.78s)]
*  As any other country? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1361.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1362.82s)]
*  Per person? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1363.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1364.48s)]
*  But the money isn't going towards them getting, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1366.2s)]
*  so we'd almost save the money just by, you got it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1369.24s)]
*  All right, here, example. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1371.96s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1373.28s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1374.12s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1375.0s)]
*  It is true. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1375.84s)]
*  Chairman of the bloody committee, yes, it is true. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1376.6599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1378.48s)]
*  Bloody literally, people are completely invalidated. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1379.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1382.1599999999999s)]
*  If I buy a car tomorrow for 80,000, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1383.56s)]
*  you buy a car for 40,000, what is the presumption? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  Should my car be a better car than yours? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1389.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1392.08s)]
*  Okay, I'm spending twice as much. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1392.9199999999998s)]
*  All right, but I got a really much great better car [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  than you have. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1397.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1398.64s)]
*  We are spending per person, per person, over $13,000. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1399.46s)]
*  All right, spending 13,000 on you, 13,000 on me, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1405.08s)]
*  13,000 on a five-year-old, 13,000 on a 90-year-old. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1408.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1411.2s)]
*  13,000 per person, over $4 trillion nationally. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1412.04s)]
*  Canadians are spending about half of that per person. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1416.32s)]
*  And they're taking care of everybody. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1419.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1420.92s)]
*  And the British are spending less than that. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1422.0s)]
*  Other countries, a little bit less. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1424.18s)]
*  But does that affect us with the population number [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1425.42s)]
*  that we have? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1427.3000000000002s)]
*  No, doesn't matter. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1428.14s)]
*  I mean, per person. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1428.96s)]
*  Got it. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1429.9s)]
*  I'm not talking about in gross, per person. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1430.72s)]
*  How do you stop hospitals from overcharging? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1433.66s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1438.0200000000002s)]
*  It's a corrupt system. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1439.14s)]
*  If they know that the government's gonna pick up the tab. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1440.3000000000002s)]
*  Good, very good question. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1442.6200000000001s)]
*  The answer is what they do. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1444.5s)]
*  I mean, it's not like we're inventing something. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1445.74s)]
*  Other countries do it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1447.42s)]
*  What they say to hospitals is, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1448.3400000000001s)]
*  look, you're not gonna be charging Theo [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1449.6200000000001s)]
*  when he's in a hospital. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1452.18s)]
*  You're not gonna be charging him a nickel. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1454.42s)]
*  But we know, roughly speaking, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1455.98s)]
*  in a year what you are gonna be. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1457.74s)]
*  You need a certain number of doctors and radiologists [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1459.22s)]
*  and nurses and all that stuff. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1461.62s)]
*  Here is your budget. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1463.22s)]
*  It's like a police department. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1464.68s)]
*  Here's your budget in a year. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1465.58s)]
*  You need more, maybe we can come up with more. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1467.32s)]
*  You got what we call a global budget. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1469.1399999999999s)]
*  Like the Dodgers or something. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1471.06s)]
*  Right, you got a global budget. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1472.66s)]
*  Right, you got a budget. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1475.18s)]
*  And you take care of all the needs. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1476.02s)]
*  It's not per person, you get it. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1477.58s)]
*  And what you do there, we spend as a nation, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1479.58s)]
*  one of the other insanities of this healthcare system, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1482.18s)]
*  we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on billing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1487.5s)]
*  You know what I mean by that? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1490.8600000000001s)]
*  Medical billing, yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1491.7s)]
*  All right, so I'm the insurance companies. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1492.54s)]
*  First of all, you gotta fill out forms. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1495.48s)]
*  I hire people who are not doctors or nurses, right? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1497.22s)]
*  They just book. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1500.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1501.74s)]
*  All right, you got bill collectors. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1502.5600000000002s)]
*  You go to a hospital, go down to the basement, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1503.8600000000001s)]
*  they got a hundred, well, depending on the size of the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1505.9s)]
*  hospital, dozens and dozens of people. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1507.66s)]
*  They don't see a patient. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1509.26s)]
*  They're just filling out forms. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1510.46s)]
*  Yeah, half the Philippines is people just doing [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1512.26s)]
*  medical billing over the phone, you know? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1513.78s)]
*  Well, there are countries where you show your card [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1516.5s)]
*  and that's the end of the discussion. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1518.6200000000001s)]
*  But we waste hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1520.5s)]
*  just on billing people. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1522.54s)]
*  And there's another issue I wanna discuss. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1525.18s)]
*  Life expectancy. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1528.32s)]
*  What do we know about life expectancy? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1529.74s)]
*  We're getting pretty long in the tooth. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1531.22s)]
*  Nope. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1533.54s)]
*  We're not living long. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1535.26s)]
*  Nope, compared to whom? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1536.94s)]
*  Compared to probably Vietnam. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1539.04s)]
*  I'm sure maybe. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1543.04s)]
*  All right, but, all right, we have the richest country [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  on earth. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1548.76s)]
*  Do we live longer lives than other people? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1549.98s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1553.2s)]
*  We do not. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1554.04s)]
*  In fact, we're pretty far down the list. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1555.32s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1557.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think it could be that we're not taking [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1558.8s)]
*  as good care of ourselves. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1560.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1562.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think it could be that, yeah, that we don't have [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1563.48s)]
*  as good a healthcare. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1567.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1568.24s)]
*  All right, I think that's two out of three. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1569.08s)]
*  All right, now here, there are two facts. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1571.92s)]
*  We, country, Japan, other countries, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1576.4s)]
*  will live four or five years, six years longer than we do. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1581.24s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1584.3s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1585.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1586.28s)]
*  So they'll live, I forgot what it is. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1587.1s)]
*  Like 8% or something. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1587.94s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1588.96s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1589.92s)]
*  But here's another fact that is really unbelievable. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1591.2s)]
*  It's not just that we live shorter lives [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1593.98s)]
*  despite spending so much on healthcare. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1595.64s)]
*  The gap between the 1% and the working class is 10 years. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1598.4s)]
*  If you're rich, you'll live as long as people [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1605.96s)]
*  in other countries in a long life, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  the 80s or whatever it is. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1609.36s)]
*  Working class, you're gonna live 10 years younger. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1611.24s)]
*  How does that happen, do you think? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1614.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1615.6s)]
*  Cause just stress, burnout. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1616.56s)]
*  Man, all right. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1618.52s)]
*  I'm gonna sign you up there. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1620.2s)]
*  You got it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1621.6s)]
*  Look, I think I like a lot of the things [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1622.48s)]
*  that you think about. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  All right, let's deal with the issue of stress. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1625.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1626.84s)]
*  It is twofold, it seems to me. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1628.3600000000001s)]
*  Number one is if you're rich, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1629.66s)]
*  you go to any doctor you want. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1631.4s)]
*  When you want it, get paid for all the drugs you need. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1632.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1634.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1635.64s)]
*  All right, that's a real advantage. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1636.48s)]
*  But above and beyond that, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1637.3s)]
*  working class people live under enormous stress. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1638.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1642.4s)]
*  And that takes a toll on you. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1643.24s)]
*  Takes a toll on you physically and mentally. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1644.44s)]
*  And that is, we have parts of this country [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1647.68s)]
*  where life expectancy is actually in decline. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1650.64s)]
*  Got it? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1654.92s)]
*  People are living shorter lives. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1655.76s)]
*  Because of the stress. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1656.8799999999999s)]
*  Because of the stress. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1657.72s)]
*  And with that stress and the hopelessness, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1658.54s)]
*  they turn to drugs, they turn to alcohol, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1660.8s)]
*  they turn to suicide. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1662.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  All right? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1664.84s)]
*  Bad stuff. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1665.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think those are things that, yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1666.5s)]
*  They don't even take those factors into consideration [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  when they're making all of these, you know, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1670.84s)]
*  you call to get your medical bill. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1672.6799999999998s)]
*  It's a nightmare. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1674.52s)]
*  It's like, it's a fight. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1675.36s)]
*  You almost want to, this is crazy. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  There's been times when I've been like, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1679.0s)]
*  I would rather take my own life than sit here [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  and make another fucking call. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1683.6799999999998s)]
*  And I'm not even sick, you know? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1685.08s)]
*  I'm just somebody trying to get to the bottom of the- [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1687.04s)]
*  All right, and what, why does that happen? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1689.1599999999999s)]
*  What's- [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1691.5s)]
*  Because it's loopholes. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1692.6s)]
*  They want you, they don't want you to get paid. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1693.44s)]
*  You got it! [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1695.1599999999999s)]
*  Not that hard. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1696.0s)]
*  Look, you pay me money through insurance, right? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1696.84s)]
*  So you're sick, I'm supposed to, you know, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1700.36s)]

*  are evil or terrible people that want people to suffer. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1909.6599999999999s)]
*  They don't. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1912.02s)]
*  But you have a system which almost says, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1913.54s)]
*  oh, you can't even think about guaranteeing healthcare [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1915.3s)]
*  to all people. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1918.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, you're a far leftist. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1919.2199999999998s)]
*  What, you're a communist man? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1922.3799999999999s)]
*  What are you? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1923.4199999999998s)]
*  You don't want to take all the insurance companies, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1925.26s)]
*  hardworking people. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1926.7399999999998s)]
*  So it almost, you're not even allowed [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1928.78s)]
*  to talk about those issues. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1931.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, we're the only country [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1933.4599999999998s)]
*  that doesn't guarantee healthcare. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1935.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, my one caveat, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1936.7399999999998s)]
*  and I don't know exactly what caveat means, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1938.1399999999999s)]
*  but I think my one left turn on it would be, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1939.78s)]
*  yeah, how much responsibility then do people, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1946.1399999999999s)]
*  are people gonna just have totally less responsibility [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1949.02s)]
*  and just be taking pills? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1951.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's just a crazy thought, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1953.62s)]
*  but if it's not happening in other countries, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1955.54s)]
*  then maybe that's a good example [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1957.2199999999998s)]
*  that it wouldn't happen here. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1958.8999999999999s)]
*  It is an issue in other countries. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1959.9399999999998s)]
*  For example, all right, you're a lonely, older person, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1961.2199999999998s)]
*  maybe you're living by yourself. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1964.74s)]
*  Feeling lonely, maybe I'll go to the doctor, right, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1966.98s)]
*  when I'm not really sick, right? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1969.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1970.8200000000002s)]
*  Will people abuse it? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1971.66s)]
*  Yeah, so what? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1972.5s)]
*  I mean, it happens and you try to discourage that. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1973.3400000000001s)]
*  So my system is perfect. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1976.5800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1978.3000000000002s)]
*  But the bottom line, as Americans, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1979.14s)]
*  we have to answer a very simple question. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1981.1000000000001s)]
*  Is healthcare a right of all people, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1983.94s)]
*  whether you're rich, poor, medium, whatever you are? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1985.94s)]
*  I think the answer is yes. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1988.38s)]
*  Well, I think especially when you start to look [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1989.7800000000002s)]
*  at other places that we spend our money, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1991.14s)]
*  it would be very hard not to say, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1993.26s)]
*  we should certainly spend it there first. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1995.86s)]
*  It's just fucking unbelievable [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1998.1399999999999s)]
*  that we're this powerful of a country [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=1999.4599999999998s)]
*  and we don't have a, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2002.1399999999999s)]
*  an emote, like, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2005.3799999999999s)]
*  it's like we lost our emotional. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2007.2199999999998s)]
*  All right, that's a good point. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2009.5s)]
*  And I'll tell you something else. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2010.9799999999998s)]
*  Let me get off of healthcare for a second. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2012.1s)]
*  Okay, well, before we get off, I want to, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2013.4599999999998s)]
*  so I know that you guys have a bill, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2014.8999999999999s)]
*  because I have a group that I've worked with, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2019.34s)]
*  done volunteer or stuff with, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2021.3799999999999s)]
*  called Power to the Patients, right? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2022.4199999999998s)]
*  And it's notating the prices of, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2024.38s)]
*  like, say you get an MRI, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2027.8600000000001s)]
*  like the hospital now has to let you know [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2029.0600000000002s)]
*  that the MRI is $700, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2031.3000000000002s)]
*  so you can call the hospital down the street [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2032.8200000000002s)]
*  and see that there it's $550, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2034.74s)]
*  so you can make a choice, so you know upfront. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2037.1000000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2039.7s)]
*  So you're not getting a $10,000 bill later on. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2040.5400000000002s)]
*  You got it. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2042.18s)]
*  It's called the Transparency Bill. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2043.0200000000002s)]
*  Transparency Bill. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2044.38s)]
*  And has it passed yet or no? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2045.22s)]
*  No, it has not. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2046.22s)]
*  I'm working with it with a guy named Senator Braun [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2047.0600000000002s)]
*  from Indiana, who's a Republican. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2050.1400000000003s)]
*  Good guy. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2051.9s)]
*  And look, it's exactly the issue. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2053.72s)]
*  People walk into an emergency room, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2055.52s)]
*  they walk into a hospital. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2058.48s)]
*  You have any idea? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, here, Theo, this is what we're going to do for you, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2061.9199999999996s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2063.6s)]
*  and you come out and you drop dead [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2064.7999999999997s)]
*  because you see a bill of tens of thousands of dollars, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2066.04s)]
*  right? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2068.24s)]
*  That's a crazy part. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2069.08s)]
*  I mean, people go in surgery. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2069.9199999999996s)]
*  They come out hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2071.9599999999996s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2074.0s)]
*  It is, it's insane. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2075.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2075.9199999999996s)]
*  And the point is, look, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2076.7599999999998s)]
*  I should have the right to know, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2079.2s)]
*  you want to hear, you think it's crazy? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2081.8s)]
*  Let me tell you how crazy, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2084.0s)]
*  it's even crazier than you think it is. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2085.28s)]
*  Okay. Okay? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2086.8s)]
*  You have Blue Cross Insurance. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2088.32s)]
*  I have another insurance company. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2090.0800000000004s)]
*  Same hospital. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2091.6400000000003s)]
*  You go and get an MRI. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2093.2400000000002s)]
*  Your insurance company will pay $500. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2095.44s)]
*  My insurance company pays $700. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2098.6000000000004s)]
*  So even in the same hospital for the same treatment, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2101.84s)]
*  the price is different, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2103.92s)]
*  not to mention different hospitals. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2105.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2106.76s)]
*  Well, it's just wild that they can do that. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2107.6000000000004s)]
*  It's almost like I'm going to go to the grocery store. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2109.32s)]
*  I'm going to get an apple, right? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2111.56s)]
*  I'm going to eat it. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2113.44s)]
*  And then after I eat it, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2114.28s)]
*  you're going to tell me how much it costs. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2115.1200000000003s)]
*  You got it. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2117.28s)]
*  That is like, it's $400. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2118.1200000000003s)]
*  You're like, is it from the Garden of Eden? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2120.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, like, where is this? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2122.88s)]
*  But it's even worse. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2123.7200000000003s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2124.56s)]
*  But it's even worse because you had to go to the hospital. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2125.84s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2128.0s)]
*  Yes. It wasn't a choice that you made. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2129.7200000000003s)]
*  I know you guys had launched an investigation even, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2132.88s)]
*  because this is kind of current about Ozempic, right? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2135.0800000000004s)]
*  And the cost of Ozempic in different countries, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2136.88s)]
*  because I was dating a girl or not dating, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2140.2400000000002s)]
*  but we met up a couple of times at night or whatever. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2141.8s)]
*  And it's like, she was leaving one morning [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2144.0s)]
*  to drive to Mexico to get Ozempic. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2146.4s)]
*  And I'm like, what are you? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2149.4s)]
*  You're just driving in the middle of the, you know, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2150.2400000000002s)]
*  at five, you have to go to, what's going on? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2152.52s)]
*  And she's like, well, it's just way cheaper there. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2154.5600000000004s)]
*  And I'm like, but is it as regulated? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2156.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2158.2000000000003s)]
*  But I know that in some countries, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2159.0400000000004s)]
*  the prices on it are so different. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2161.6800000000003s)]
*  Like in Canada, it's $150 something. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2163.2400000000002s)]
*  Got it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  And in America, it's 700 and something. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2167.48s)]
*  It's close to a thousand dollars for a diabetes medication. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2170.2s)]
*  I know some people use it for, you know, kind of- [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2172.3199999999997s)]
*  Weight loss. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2175.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, weight loss or look the way they want, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2176.16s)]
*  spring break or whatever, but that's crazy. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2178.3599999999997s)]
*  Why isn't it just the same? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2181.6s)]
*  Is it because they know they can charge us more [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2183.9599999999996s)]
*  because we have more money? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2185.68s)]
*  That's half of it, but only half of it. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2187.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2190.24s)]
*  Thanks for asking it. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2191.4399999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2192.3999999999996s)]
*  That's what my committee deals with every day. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2193.24s)]
*  We've had, by the way, some success in the last few years. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2194.3199999999997s)]
*  And the Biden people have done a good job on this. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2197.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2199.48s)]
*  Why is it that, I want to make sure I'm right here. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2200.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, certainly in Canada, it's about 150 bucks for Ozempic. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2204.7599999999998s)]
*  Here it's 900, close to a thousand. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2209.64s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2213.08s)]
*  What the Canadians do and what countries [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2214.56s)]
*  around the world do, what makes common sense? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2216.9199999999996s)]
*  They purchase a lot of the drug, right? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2220.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2223.04s)]
*  So they sit down with the drug companies. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2223.8799999999997s)]
*  They said, look, you know, we have [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2224.9199999999996s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people are going to use your drug. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2227.04s)]
*  We're going to sit down and negotiate a price, right? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2229.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2232.2s)]
*  Of course, certainly after a few months, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2233.04s)]
*  you'd be able to see the averages [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2233.88s)]
*  and make a good business choice. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2235.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2236.56s)]
*  I mean, if you're a businessman [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2237.4s)]
*  and you're buying something from me, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2240.28s)]
*  you're buying thousands of items, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2242.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to give you a discount [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2244.64s)]
*  if I want your business, right? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2245.96s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2247.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2247.88s)]
*  That's the way the business works. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2248.72s)]
*  So that's what every country on earth does. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2249.56s)]
*  They sit down with the drug companies. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2250.76s)]
*  Some do it more stringently than others. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2251.96s)]
*  Up until very, very recently, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2255.96s)]
*  there have been no requirements, zero, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2258.84s)]
*  for the drug companies to negotiate anything. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2262.2s)]
*  So they come in and they say, they have the board. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2264.52s)]
*  What do you think we can get, Harry? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2266.8s)]
*  Sitting around there, board of directors. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2268.44s)]
*  Well, actually, I think you can get $10,000 a year. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2269.68s)]
*  I think you can go higher. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2273.32s)]
*  They can get 20,000. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2274.16s)]
*  Look, we get what the market will bear. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2275.2400000000002s)]
*  Government has no power, charge of anything you want. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2277.48s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2281.8s)]
*  So you got now, it's not just Ozempic, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2283.48s)]
*  in which we pay in some cases, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2286.76s)]
*  15 times more than European countries. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2288.4s)]
*  It's all kinds of drugs. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2291.88s)]
*  So the answer is, the answer to your question is, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2293.2400000000002s)]
*  up until recently, and the Biden administration [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2296.0s)]
*  has done a good job of this, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2298.0s)]
*  there have been no capabilities of the government, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2299.44s)]
*  Medicare, anybody else, to negotiate prices. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2302.28s)]
*  They charge anything they want [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2304.52s)]
*  and as much as they possibly can. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2306.96s)]
*  What we did is part of a bill called [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2308.92s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2311.0s)]
*  stupid title to the bill, but that's what it was, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2312.36s)]
*  finally have that the drug companies [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2314.76s)]
*  gonna have to sit down with Medicare and negotiate prices. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2318.1200000000003s)]
*  They're gonna be announcing some interesting results [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2320.7200000000003s)]
*  pretty soon. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2322.76s)]
*  So for the first time, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2323.6000000000004s)]
*  there is the beginning of negotiating prices [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2325.2400000000002s)]
*  and it will lower prices. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2327.48s)]
*  Second of all, what we've done on my committee, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2328.7200000000003s)]
*  a lot of people have asthma and they use inhalers. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2330.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you know anybody using asthma inhaler. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2335.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2337.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2338.84s)]
*  10 times more expensive than the United States. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2339.96s)]
*  So if we kind of shamed some of the big companies, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2341.84s)]
*  they lowered it down to some of them to $35. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2344.0s)]
*  So making some progress on lowering the cost [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2346.5600000000004s)]
*  of prescription drugs. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2349.1200000000003s)]
*  But to answer your question, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2350.0800000000004s)]
*  up until a couple of years ago, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2351.6800000000003s)]
*  drug companies could charge any price they wanted [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2354.0s)]
*  for any reason. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2356.44s)]
*  And now, and that could be changing with the Inflation Act? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2358.44s)]
*  Yeah, Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2362.48s)]
*  What it basically said is the 10 top selling drugs, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2363.6000000000004s)]
*  they're gonna have to come then and sit down [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2367.7200000000003s)]
*  and negotiate with Medicare price. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2369.28s)]
*  That is by the way, what the Veterans Administration does. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2370.96s)]
*  The VA in America does a good job. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2373.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2376.0s)]
*  They don't pay outrageous prices. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2376.84s)]
*  They negotiate and that's what Medicare is beginning to do. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2378.48s)]
*  Yeah, if you can't breathe, I mean, yeah, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2380.92s)]
*  you're almost a fish if you can't breathe, you know? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2382.4s)]
*  Let's talk about some politics. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2386.44s)]
*  Oh wait, and so, and the price transparency, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2387.84s)]
*  that's happening now? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  Like people have to show their prices or they don't? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2392.04s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2394.84s)]
*  We still haven't passed that bill. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2395.68s)]
*  Okay, do you think it's gonna happen? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2396.8s)]
*  It's a popular bill. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2398.64s)]
*  I think we have a good shot to get it done. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2399.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2401.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah man, it makes me just sick [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2402.92s)]
*  because somebody is already sick. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  You know they're sick. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2405.92s)]
*  Like if it were your family, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2407.0s)]
*  you want them to just sit there and just be angry. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2408.7200000000003s)]
*  They're on the phone every day, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2411.7200000000003s)]
*  then they don't have any energy for their own family. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2412.88s)]
*  It's just. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2414.92s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2415.76s)]
*  I just can't imagine choosing, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2417.88s)]
*  especially when you're already making a ton of money, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2421.6800000000003s)]
*  choosing to make a little more money. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2423.92s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2425.44s)]
*  Well now you're raising even another issue. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2426.56s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2428.6800000000003s)]
*  You're talking about corporate greed here, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2429.96s)]
*  but that's another issue. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2431.4s)]
*  Yeah, I know you hate it. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2432.24s)]
*  We all hate it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2433.68s)]
*  I think America's at the point where [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2434.52s)]
*  the screw has been turned so fucking tight [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2436.68s)]
*  that I think yeah, it starts to create radicalization, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  starts to create a lot of stuff. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2444.28s)]
*  Let's talk about the election coming up right now [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2446.16s)]
*  or just the current candidacy. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2451.04s)]
*  I wanted, in 2020 I believe that's when you ran, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2452.8s)]
*  I wanted you and Donald Trump to be on the same ticket. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2457.24s)]
*  That was a thought that I had because in my mind, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2460.48s)]
*  I'm just a regular guy. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2463.56s)]
*  I don't know a ton about politics. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2464.9199999999996s)]
*  I wanted, I felt both y'all were outliers. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2467.12s)]
*  That's how it seemed to me. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2469.8799999999997s)]
*  These guys are both outliers. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2470.7999999999997s)]
*  They're both different, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2472.12s)]
*  but seem to be doing their own thing. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2475.0s)]
*  You've been outspoken against Trump. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2478.52s)]
*  Do you think he's not, is he doing his own thing or is he? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2480.96s)]
*  Look, I will give Trump credit. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2486.1600000000003s)]
*  He does his own thing. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2488.8s)]
*  He's a very different type of politician and that's clear. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2490.36s)]
*  But this is what I do think, Theo. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2495.6800000000003s)]
*  While I respect somebody who has the guts [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2498.32s)]
*  to do their own thing and be very much [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2500.44s)]
*  a non-traditional politician, which is what he is, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2503.2000000000003s)]
*  is the facts. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2506.44s)]
*  He lies all the time. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2507.76s)]
*  And I got four kids and I got seven grandchildren [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2510.48s)]
*  and we really have to ask ourselves [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2514.24s)]
*  whether the guy who is the leader of the country, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2516.56s)]
*  whether that's the kind of example that we want. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2519.08s)]
*  So I have a lot of friends in politics who differ with me, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2522.16s)]
*  more conservative people. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2525.3199999999997s)]
*  They're not liars. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2526.3599999999997s)]
*  We disagree. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2527.3599999999997s)]
*  So you and I disagree on something. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2528.2s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2529.2799999999997s)]
*  So what? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2530.12s)]
*  It's called American democracy. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2530.96s)]
*  Yeah, it used to be fine. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2531.7999999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2532.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2533.46s)]
*  But Trump really is, I use the word pathological. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2534.2999999999997s)]
*  He lies. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2536.72s)]
*  When you see him, not everything, but a lot of lies. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2538.6s)]
*  And I think that's, we can't have that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2542.8s)]
*  When he was in the private sector, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2546.8s)]
*  before he became involved in politics, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2549.84s)]
*  he was sued, his companies were sued 4,000 times. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2552.08s)]
*  And I just, above and beyond his political views, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2557.56s)]
*  which I disagree with, but then those of you can discuss, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2560.16s)]
*  I don't think you want somebody leading this country [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2563.48s)]
*  who is shady. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2565.8s)]
*  So you're saying he doesn't set the best example of- [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2566.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2570.48s)]
*  Look, you've got kids. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2571.32s)]
*  Do you have any kids? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2572.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't have any yet. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2573.7999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2574.64s)]
*  Well, I hope you do. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2575.4799999999996s)]
*  And you want kids to be honest, right? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2576.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2577.8399999999997s)]
*  You don't want them to be bullies and picking on the weak. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2578.68s)]
*  And he said that from a character point of view, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2581.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't like him. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2584.0s)]
*  But also let me give another example. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2585.08s)]
*  I happen to believe, I don't know what your views are, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2586.3999999999996s)]
*  that women have a right to control their own bodies. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2589.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't want, as a man, somebody saying, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2592.56s)]
*  oh, Bernie, you can't have a vasectomy. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2594.72s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2596.4799999999996s)]
*  My business, not the government's. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2597.4399999999996s)]
*  And Trump does not hold that view. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2599.56s)]
*  I happen to believe strongly that climate change is real. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2603.04s)]
*  Just a week or two ago- [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2607.16s)]
*  Yeah, so your podcast with Bill, Billinkoff? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2608.32s)]
*  Bill McKibben, of course. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2611.6s)]
*  I've known Bill McKibben. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2612.52s)]
*  Bill McKibben, yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2613.52s)]
*  Yeah, and Bill is- [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2614.36s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get to speak to him. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2615.68s)]
*  He seems really interesting. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2617.08s)]
*  Smart guy. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2618.52s)]
*  Is he? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2619.4s)]
*  I've known him for years. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2620.24s)]
*  Yeah, because I want to learn more about, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2621.08s)]
*  you just always hear about climate change. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2622.12s)]
*  And so yeah, I want to learn more about it. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2623.64s)]
*  Good. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2624.96s)]
*  And I hope you do. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2625.8s)]
*  And I'm sure Bill would be happy to go on the show with you. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2626.8s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2630.1600000000003s)]
*  If you wanted, I'd give him a call. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2631.0s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2631.84s)]
*  All of the scientists agree, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2635.6000000000004s)]
*  when you put carbon into the atmosphere, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2636.96s)]
*  it creates a ceiling there. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2640.92s)]
*  The earth warms up. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2643.6400000000003s)]
*  And then because of the earth warming up, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2644.6800000000003s)]
*  you have extreme weather disturbances like, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2646.52s)]
*  you come from Louisiana, do you? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2650.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah, we're sinking. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2651.6400000000003s)]
*  You've seen the terrible floods there. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2652.76s)]
*  We've had them here in Vermont. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2654.32s)]
*  Yeah, they have a savanna right now going on. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2655.7200000000003s)]
*  Right, that's right. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2657.48s)]
*  Floods, the likes of which we've never seen. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2660.08s)]
*  You've seen drought. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2661.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, in Saudi Arabia, temperature reached 125 degrees, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2663.3999999999996s)]
*  which people are dying by the hundreds. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2666.9199999999996s)]
*  So Trump does not believe that climate change is real. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2670.12s)]
*  And if he becomes president, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2673.4399999999996s)]
*  that means not only will the United States, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2675.52s)]
*  the whole world will give up. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2677.7599999999998s)]
*  And I don't know what this planet is going to look like [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2679.6s)]
*  in 10, 15 years. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2682.52s)]
*  And do you say that because America is really the leader [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2684.4399999999996s)]
*  of the forefront of looking out for climate change? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2686.72s)]
*  Yeah, we're the largest economy in the world. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2689.7599999999998s)]
*  China is a bigger polluter than we are right now. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2692.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2694.8399999999997s)]
*  They all smoke too, a lot of Chinese people. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2695.72s)]
*  You have that kid that smokes on that bicycle [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2698.2799999999997s)]
*  or whatever, he's smoking like 11 cigarettes. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2700.12s)]
*  But if we say, hey, the hell with it, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2702.04s)]
*  then other countries are going to, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2706.12s)]
*  because it's a global problem. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2707.2799999999997s)]
*  Right, then everybody's going to be like, oh, screw it. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2708.8399999999997s)]
*  You got everybody back so often. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2710.44s)]
*  And then I don't know what this planet, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2712.08s)]
*  you talk about floods, it's going to get worse and worse. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2713.3199999999997s)]
*  Heat waves, worse drought, worse migrations. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2715.6s)]
*  There are millions, hundreds of millions of people, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2718.6s)]
*  little farmers in poor countries. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2721.08s)]
*  They can't farm anymore. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2723.52s)]
*  So I disagree with Trump on that. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2725.32s)]
*  So those are some of the reasons why [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2727.36s)]
*  I'm strongly against it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2729.2s)]
*  Those are important issues, certainly, yeah. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2730.32s)]
*  And I don't think everybody, yeah, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2732.44s)]
*  it's like everybody can have their own thoughts [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2733.4s)]
*  on different issues. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2735.4s)]
*  And do you see why people like him? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2736.24s)]
*  I do, because he's very disarming. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2738.92s)]
*  He gets up there and he says whatever the hell he wants. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2742.2799999999997s)]
*  He is not. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2744.56s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't seem like he's by the book. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2745.72s)]
*  That was a thing. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2747.4s)]
*  He is not by the book. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2748.24s)]
*  Right, and so that's something, and the same as you, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2749.06s)]
*  it's like he's speaking for, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2750.44s)]
*  it feels like they're speaking for themselves, right? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2752.36s)]
*  Whether you agree with maybe what they believe, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2755.52s)]
*  they believe what they're saying. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2757.92s)]
*  And that, I think, comes through. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2760.0s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2761.7999999999997s)]
*  Clearly to people. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2762.64s)]
*  I think, you know, he's certainly unusual. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2763.48s)]
*  Gets up there and he rants and he does his thing, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2765.7599999999998s)]
*  and he's not necessarily, I'm sure his advisors go crazy. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2767.88s)]
*  But he's not reading off, you know, he doesn't have 14. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2771.12s)]
*  Kid Rock is one of his advisors, you know? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  And look, I love Kid Rock, but you know, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2775.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if every advice of his is the best, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2780.08s)]
*  but now some of it is, that's for sure, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2783.12s)]
*  but some of it may not be. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2785.0s)]
*  You're right, and you know, a lot of these politicians [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2785.8399999999997s)]
*  have 18 different consultants. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2787.9599999999996s)]
*  You can't use that word, you can't say that. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2789.3199999999997s)]
*  And he's not like that. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2791.8399999999997s)]
*  And that makes it miserable. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2792.68s)]
*  He's not like that, right? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2793.5s)]
*  And people find that appealing, I get it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2794.3399999999997s)]
*  But you know, again, I don't think you could have [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2796.4399999999996s)]
*  a pathological liar or somebody doesn't believe in women, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2798.48s)]
*  have the right women, have the right to control their bodies. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2801.4s)]
*  You know, who doesn't believe in climate change? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2804.0s)]
*  I think that's bad. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2805.44s)]
*  By the way, I'm not quite so sure, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2807.08s)]
*  but she believes in democracy as well. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2809.12s)]
*  Yeah, well, and look, yeah, that's how you feel, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2811.0s)]
*  and it's important. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2814.44s)]
*  And you've always had your own feelings, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2816.2000000000003s)]
*  and I appreciate you always having them [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2817.6s)]
*  and sharing what they are. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2819.92s)]
*  Did you feel like whenever the people tried to assassinate, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2821.1600000000003s)]
*  did you think it was deeper than that? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2823.6s)]
*  Or you think it was just some Reddit jockey just on a bridge? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2824.88s)]
*  First of all, it was horrible. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2827.28s)]
*  I mean, I disagree with Trump on everything, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2828.4s)]
*  but the idea of people assassinating Trump [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2830.28s)]
*  or anybody else is... [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2832.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2834.92s)]
*  It's crazy, it is horrible, and it's... [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2835.88s)]
*  I mean, I can't give you the words. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2838.28s)]
*  It's just terrible. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2840.2000000000003s)]
*  We cannot have that in American politics. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2841.52s)]
*  My own guess, and I'm not an expert, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2843.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure there are a lot of, you know, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2845.36s)]
*  conspiratorial theories that are out there. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2847.88s)]
*  You know, I think you have... [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2849.76s)]
*  You know, we've seen it before. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2851.6000000000004s)]
*  You've seen seemingly normal people walking into schools [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2852.6400000000003s)]
*  with guns doing horrible things, right? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2856.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2858.76s)]
*  And I think you had whatever reason. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2860.12s)]
*  I don't want to even speculate [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2861.84s)]
*  why this young man did what he did. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2864.3199999999997s)]
*  You just think it was a young man who just... That was it. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2866.52s)]
*  That's what the evidence seems to suggest so far. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2868.36s)]
*  But you didn't hear anything else. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2870.92s)]
*  You guys don't hear anything else as Congress people. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2871.92s)]
*  You don't hear anything deeper than that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2873.92s)]
*  I don't know any great secrets that you don't know. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2874.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2876.48s)]
*  Do you think that Kamala Harris is the best person [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2877.72s)]
*  to run against Donald Trump right now? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2879.52s)]
*  Well, she is the person, and that's... [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2882.12s)]
*  And that won't change, probably, huh? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2884.48s)]
*  No, she'll be the Democratic candidate. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2886.24s)]
*  And, you know, I've known Kamala for a number of years. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2888.2s)]
*  Not best friends, but I've known her. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2892.0s)]
*  She was in the Senate for a short period. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2894.52s)]
*  She's very smart. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2896.16s)]
*  And she's determined. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2897.68s)]
*  I mean, above and beyond her views on the issues, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2898.96s)]
*  which I support most of them, not all. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2902.3999999999996s)]
*  You got to give credit to somebody, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2906.3999999999996s)]
*  a black woman, to move up the ladder. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2908.68s)]
*  That ain't easy stuff. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2910.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of resistance to that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2911.2799999999997s)]
*  And she's persistent, she's strong, and I respect that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2913.04s)]
*  And I think she'll be a good candidate. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2917.52s)]
*  I was interested that Trump apparently [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2920.72s)]
*  backed out of a debate with her on ABC. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2923.48s)]
*  I wouldn't, you know, I have debated her, as a matter of fact. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2928.2400000000002s)]
*  She's tough. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  She's tough. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2933.08s)]
*  Was there a chance that you were going to get that nominee, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2933.96s)]
*  or as an independent, can you get Ben Plotty [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2936.72s)]
*  with the Democratic Party and put in? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2939.08s)]
*  Was there even a call about it or anything? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2941.08s)]
*  No, you know, I ran in 16. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2942.72s)]
*  I ran against Hillary Clinton, and I ran in 20. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2944.68s)]
*  Yeah, I remember, and I felt like you, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2946.68s)]
*  I felt like you didn't get treated fairly, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2949.3599999999997s)]
*  to be honest with you. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2950.64s)]
*  Well, I didn't, and that's what happens [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2951.48s)]
*  when you take on the establishment. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2952.7999999999997s)]
*  So what happened is we won the first three primaries, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2954.12s)]
*  and then the establishment got very, very nervous, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2957.3199999999997s)]
*  and they got a whole lot of candidates [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2961.56s)]
*  in the Democratic primary. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2963.2799999999997s)]
*  And they said, hey, it'd be a good idea [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2964.9199999999996s)]
*  if you all dropped out, let Joe Biden be the one candidate. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2966.3599999999997s)]
*  People rallied around them. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2968.8799999999997s)]
*  And do they call, is there a call that you get, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2970.3599999999997s)]
*  and it's like, you're not going to move forward? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  Is it just like news articles? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2974.24s)]
*  How does the establishment kind of work? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2976.44s)]
*  Well, what happens is I won the popular vote in Iowa. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2977.28s)]
*  I won the New Hampshire primary. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2980.96s)]
*  I won the Nevada primary, and those were the first three. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2982.4s)]
*  And then, from pages of New York Times, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2985.24s)]
*  Democratic establishment, very nervous. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2987.24s)]
*  Bernie Sanders go in the whole, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2989.2s)]
*  we were doing very well in the polls. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2990.52s)]
*  And, you know, I think behind the scenes, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2992.84s)]
*  people saw, you know, there were like 15 [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2995.6s)]
*  different candidates, and they were splitting up the vote. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2997.16s)]
*  And that's how I was, I was not necessarily [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=2999.76s)]
*  getting over 50%, I was getting more than other people. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3002.48s)]
*  So I was on the way to victory. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3004.84s)]
*  And they said, look, Bernie shouldn't be the candidate [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3006.6400000000003s)]
*  for a variety of reasons, we don't want him the candidate. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3010.6800000000003s)]
*  Drop out. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3012.6800000000003s)]
*  And then on one day, a lot of people, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3013.52s)]
*  one or two days, a lot of people dropped out. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3015.76s)]
*  It was Joe Biden and me, and Joe had a lot of support, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3017.6000000000004s)]
*  and all these people came behind him, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3019.52s)]
*  and that's what happened. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3020.76s)]
*  Let me also say, you know, having said that, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  Biden is a friend of mine. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  I think he's done a very good job [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3026.2400000000002s)]
*  over the last three and a half years. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3027.56s)]
*  And I'm working very hard to see that Kamala [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3029.32s)]
*  is elected our next president. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3031.1200000000003s)]
*  The heat of summer is here. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3033.6s)]
*  God, it's hot. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3035.7999999999997s)]
*  My shadows do not even, I saw it having a lemonade yesterday [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3037.48s)]
*  and wearing ice pack on its neck, like God. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3042.48s)]
*  That's why you need Liquid IV. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3046.96s)]
*  They have refreshing summer flavors [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3050.04s)]
*  like Popsicle Firecracker, Rainbow Sherbert. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3052.8399999999997s)]

*  It's simple. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3072.16s)]
*  Just tear, pour, and live more. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3073.04s)]
*  One stick plus 16 ounces of water hydrates [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3076.96s)]
*  better than water alone. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3080.16s)]
*  You know, I like that Liquid IV. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3082.0s)]
*  It makes the water just, it gives it a lot of just gumption. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3083.2000000000003s)]
*  Makes you just feel like you could just hug somebody [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3087.2000000000003s)]
*  right after you have it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3090.16s)]

*  started to seem like people were losing faith in the media, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3131.52s)]
*  right? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3135.3999999999996s)]
*  And I feel like that that's had a huge effect on society. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3136.12s)]
*  It's created a lot of opportunities [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3138.7599999999998s)]
*  for what are often labeled as conspiracy theories, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3140.8399999999997s)]
*  but then often end up being truth just because, not often, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3143.7999999999997s)]
*  but yeah, often end up being truths or having realness to them [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3147.08s)]
*  because the news media isn't even, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3152.68s)]
*  it's like they all just go down these same similar paths [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3156.0s)]
*  and it doesn't even feel real anymore. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3158.44s)]
*  I mean, the fact that you and I are talking is wild. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3161.36s)]
*  I fucking wouldn't talk to me. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3165.0s)]
*  Look, the bad news is bad news and good news. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3169.96s)]
*  The good news is you got a program, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3172.48s)]
*  and by millions of people doing it to you. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3174.4s)]
*  And part of that is that people not necessarily [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3177.04s)]
*  believe CBS, NBC, ABC, or even Fox or anybody else. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3180.1200000000003s)]
*  And so let me tell you what I think about that. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3184.28s)]
*  I think you're touching on an important issue. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3187.48s)]
*  We talk about health care. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3189.52s)]
*  We talk about media. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3190.52s)]
*  You have about eight large media conglomerates, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3191.76s)]
*  Comcast and all these guys. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3198.0800000000004s)]
*  They're huge. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3199.7200000000003s)]
*  Serious. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3200.2400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3201.1200000000003s)]
*  They own, people turn on their. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3202.2400000000002s)]
*  Clear channel. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3204.28s)]
*  You got it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3205.2s)]
*  You got it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3205.7599999999998s)]
*  They're huge. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3206.3599999999997s)]
*  They own, they don't own one station. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3206.8799999999997s)]
*  They own radio stations. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3209.2799999999997s)]
*  They own TV stations. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3210.96s)]
*  They own movies, you know, producers. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3212.48s)]
*  So these are owned by very large billionaires. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3214.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, big companies owned by billionaires. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3219.3599999999997s)]
*  And they will discuss issues from here to here. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3222.24s)]
*  I gave you an example about Medicare for all. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3225.7999999999997s)]
*  We should be having a tremendous discussion [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3228.0s)]
*  why we're the only country on Earth [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3230.0s)]
*  that to guarantee health care. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3231.3199999999997s)]
*  It doesn't take place on television. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3232.56s)]
*  We should be talking about massive income [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3234.68s)]
*  and wealth inequality. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3236.6s)]
*  There are three people in America, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3237.7999999999997s)]
*  one more wealth at the bottom half of American society. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3239.0s)]
*  Think that's appropriate? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3241.3199999999997s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3242.2799999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3243.12s)]
*  I think there should be a limit on how much a person can earn. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3243.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3245.6s)]
*  To be honest with you, maybe, you know, some millions. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3246.3599999999997s)]
*  But I don't think it should be billions. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3250.08s)]
*  Someone should have. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3251.48s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3251.96s)]
*  I agree with you, actually. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3252.8799999999997s)]
*  And I think most Americans would. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3253.96s)]
*  When's the last time you've seen that discussion on NBC? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3256.12s)]
*  It ain't going to take place. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3258.7999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3260.48s)]
*  We have. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3261.4s)]
*  But that's what the people want, though. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3262.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes, that is exactly it. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3263.88s)]
*  That's why you're a success and why other people, you know, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3265.28s)]
*  with very limited resources, if you like, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3268.32s)]
*  because you don't see that type of discussion. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3270.7200000000003s)]
*  I just did a poll. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3273.2000000000003s)]
*  My campaign did a poll just on these issues. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3274.4s)]
*  You know, talking about issues that working class people [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3277.76s)]
*  want and need that are almost never discussed in politics [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3280.56s)]
*  or in the corporate media. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3284.6400000000003s)]
*  And the answer is people are hurting. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3285.6400000000003s)]
*  They want change. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3287.56s)]
*  No one's talking about it. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3288.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3289.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's heartbreaking. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3290.6400000000003s)]
*  It's like, I don't know. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3291.56s)]
*  The people don't even get thought of anymore, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3293.08s)]
*  it feels like, a lot of times. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3294.7599999999998s)]
*  And here's the toughest part, I think, Bernie, is as a person [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3296.2s)]
*  who has felt like in their life maybe their father died [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3298.96s)]
*  in a war, their grandfather died in a war, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3302.52s)]
*  and they've been trying to pay their taxes [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3304.2s)]
*  and be a considerate person in their town or their country. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3306.2799999999997s)]
*  After a while, those good people start. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3311.92s)]
*  It starts to erode a little because they don't feel like, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3313.6s)]
*  and they lose their sense of purpose. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3318.72s)]
*  You lose the fabric of your society. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3320.68s)]
*  A lot of people, that's how they, they didn't even realize it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3323.44s)]
*  A lot of us don't even realize that. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3326.2s)]
*  We identify as an American. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3327.48s)]
*  And when you realize, well, America, it's nothing, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3329.56s)]
*  but it's a shell LLC for fucking big corporations, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3331.6s)]
*  then what am I? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3336.2s)]
*  I'm just a idiot. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3337.08s)]
*  You almost feel ashamed of yourself. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3339.7999999999997s)]
*  Or you can, you know? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3342.2799999999997s)]
*  Anyway, just, I don't know. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3343.2799999999997s)]
*  A lot of that stuff just, I just don't [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3345.2799999999997s)]
*  see how people think that that's good [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3347.64s)]
*  or how you're going to still be able to get people to buy in. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3349.44s)]
*  I think you said it better than I did. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3352.76s)]
*  I mean, I agree with you. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3354.52s)]
*  I think a lot of people are ashamed. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3355.56s)]
*  They're giving up. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3358.52s)]
*  They're hurting. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3359.32s)]
*  Yeah, and many of these people have fought and died [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3360.88s)]
*  of their families, have fought and died in wars. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3363.0s)]
*  And they're good people. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3365.44s)]
*  Maybe they are nurses and business people. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3366.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, anything, crossing guard, mailman. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3369.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3372.16s)]
*  They believe in their community. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3372.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3374.12s)]
*  And meanwhile, they're getting ripped off [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3374.7200000000003s)]
*  by people on top politically and economically. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3376.52s)]
*  Well, even the radio, like you're saying, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3378.96s)]
*  it's like you used to have a newspaper and you read. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3380.32s)]
*  And it meant something. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3382.92s)]
*  Your community meant something. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3384.16s)]
*  It used to be that your grandpa worked at the factory [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3385.4s)]
*  and they made the table that you have in your home. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3388.16s)]
*  And so everything had a story to it. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3390.16s)]
*  There's some connection. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3391.92s)]
*  And now it's like we're buying stuff from countries. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3392.92s)]
*  They're making it. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3395.6s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3396.32s)]
*  We're using it. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3397.4s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3398.16s)]
*  There's no story. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3398.84s)]
*  Nobody has any like, there's no thread. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3399.84s)]
*  The thread just gets thin. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3406.8s)]
*  That's a very profound point you just made. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3408.16s)]
*  And so how do we get it back, you know? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3410.8399999999997s)]
*  It ain't easy. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3412.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3413.3199999999997s)]
*  But I think you hit the nail on the head. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3413.8399999999997s)]
*  Right now, you're in Vermont, which [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3420.64s)]
*  is one of the smallest states in the country. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3422.3999999999996s)]
*  It's a very rural state. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3424.7599999999998s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3425.92s)]
*  Burlington is the largest city with 40,000. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3426.7999999999997s)]
*  I used to be mayor here. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3429.08s)]
*  But you go into small towns. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3431.04s)]
*  Everybody knew everybody. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3432.64s)]
*  Often they were dairy farmers. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3433.64s)]
*  We had a lot of dairy farmers. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3434.8399999999997s)]
*  People worked really hard being a dairy farmer. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3436.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3438.08s)]
*  I used to work at Cold Stone Cramers for a while. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3438.6s)]
*  So not the same, but I get it. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3440.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3441.52s)]
*  But milking cows, you know, 5 o'clock [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3442.0s)]
*  in the morning on a cold winter day ain't easy work. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3444.0s)]
*  But everybody knew each other. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3447.24s)]
*  Nobody cheated each other. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3449.7999999999997s)]
*  There was a sense of then you have town meetings once a year [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3452.0s)]
*  and people argue about the school budget and all [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3454.56s)]
*  that stuff. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3456.56s)]
*  And we are losing that big time for a lot. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3457.64s)]
*  And maybe next time we'll talk about that. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3459.52s)]
*  But we're losing that, as you indicated, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3461.16s)]
*  for a lot of reasons. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3464.16s)]
*  And if we don't get it back, I worry about the future. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3465.64s)]
*  We're losing that big time for a lot of reasons. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3468.04s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest reason [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3470.24s)]
*  that we're losing that big time for this country. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3471.92s)]
*  Yeah, that is kind of a bigger topic. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3474.56s)]
*  I've heard you talk about the 32-hour work week, man. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3476.8s)]
*  It's intriguing. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3479.8s)]
*  Any second I heard that, I'm like, I'm in, you know? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3480.8s)]
*  I tell you, it got a lot of response. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3484.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think there was a poll. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3487.6s)]
*  I don't know if it was a Newsweek. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3488.84s)]
*  I don't know where it was. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3490.2s)]
*  Yeah, the 32-hour work week. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3492.56s)]
*  And one of the reasons behind it is why. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3494.48s)]
*  OK, here's why. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3496.84s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3497.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3498.7200000000003s)]
*  Over the last 50 years, five, zero years, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3500.28s)]
*  massive changes in technology, right? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3504.0s)]
*  50 years ago, they didn't have this stuff. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3505.88s)]
*  Worker productivity has gone way up, right? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3508.7200000000003s)]
*  So you're a worker now playing with technology, machinery, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3511.4s)]
*  whether it's a computer, whether it's factory technology. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3514.2s)]
*  You're producing a lot more, correct? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3517.96s)]
*  In terms of real. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3520.88s)]
*  You're producing more because you [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3521.8s)]
*  have machines that can help you. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3522.92s)]
*  Got it. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3524.08s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3524.56s)]
*  Much more, by the way. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3525.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3526.6s)]
*  So a machine can do the work of 30 men in a day. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3527.08s)]
*  You got it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3529.6s)]
*  Whatever it may be. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3530.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3531.24s)]
*  Despite all of that increased worker productivity, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3533.64s)]
*  is the worker of today in real inflation [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3539.52s)]
*  accounted for dollars making more or less money [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3542.68s)]
*  than that worker was doing, or a similar type worker, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3545.72s)]
*  50 years ago? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3548.68s)]
*  What's the answer? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3550.7599999999998s)]
*  I would say less. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3551.52s)]
*  So less based on inflation and everything. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3553.92s)]
*  Workers making less now than they were then. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3556.0s)]
*  In real dollars. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3557.72s)]
*  Yeah, we call real dollars. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3558.36s)]
*  Inflation accounted for dollars. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3559.48s)]
*  Real dollars. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3560.68s)]
*  Correct. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3561.2s)]
*  How insane is that if that worker is now [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3562.44s)]
*  producing so much more than he or she did for 20 years? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3565.16s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3568.32s)]
*  So now if a worker is operating a machine, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3569.4s)]
*  and that machine is doing the work of 20 workers, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3571.56s)]
*  then why isn't there some benefit to the worker? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3573.92s)]
*  You would think that that guy's making more money, right? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3576.8s)]
*  Hey, you're producing a lot more. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3581.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3582.64s)]
*  Or widgets or whatever. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3583.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3583.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3584.4s)]
*  100% more. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3584.92s)]
*  Got it? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3585.56s)]
*  OK, make a buzz. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3586.44s)]
*  Where did all that money go? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3588.24s)]
*  Well, who benefited from it? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3589.68s)]
*  Oh, the Dingo Alex Prime. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3590.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, that same tree to tongue. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3592.68s)]
*  There was a study that there was a 50 trillion un-tipical [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3595.0s)]
*  redistribution of wealth to your bottom 90% [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3601.24s)]
*  to the top 1%. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3604.24s)]
*  So getting back to the 32-hour working, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3605.64s)]
*  it's a simple idea. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3608.4s)]
*  If you aren't working producing a hell of a lot more than was [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3609.92s)]
*  the case years ago, you should benefit [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3613.8s)]
*  from an increased technology. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3616.32s)]
*  And one of the breakout people is you meant in the moment [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3618.44s)]
*  to live in under a lot of stress, right? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  If you can lower that work week without loss of pay. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3622.5600000000004s)]
*  Right, so you're saying that there [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3625.6800000000003s)]
*  needs to be some keep back to them, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3626.5600000000004s)]
*  because if everybody's earning more, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3628.1600000000003s)]
*  if the companies are earning more. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3630.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, some of the greed, it's just scary, man. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3632.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3635.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's just scary. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3637.0800000000004s)]
*  I want to get into, oh, wait, but what about, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3639.32s)]
*  would you have to raise the pay of people then? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3642.2s)]
*  Oh, I guess you would, because they're... [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3643.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know, but if you reduce, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3645.96s)]
*  what we're doing here is reducing the work week, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3649.0s)]
*  which is from 40 to 32, which, by the way, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3652.68s)]
*  has stopped being changed since 1944. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3656.04s)]
*  Yeah, and that's when people had to do crops and everything. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3658.96s)]
*  Yeah, people were just, yeah, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3661.96s)]
*  people were snitting by lightning bug. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  So we are a much wealthier nation now, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3666.08s)]
*  but I want that wealth to be distributed a little bit. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3668.6s)]
*  Yeah, come on, Alisson. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3672.8s)]
*  We're almost done, yep. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3673.64s)]
*  Okay, just one more issue I want to ask, and it'll be quick. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3674.48s)]
*  Last question, if you were to look at, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3677.32s)]
*  if there's somebody out there today who's like a guy [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3678.92s)]
*  who you were, who wanted to see change, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3681.32s)]
*  who started protesting on campuses [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3683.4s)]
*  and got involved and became a mayor, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3686.04s)]
*  and wants to get into politics and really thinks [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3688.92s)]
*  that they can make a difference, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3691.08s)]
*  what path do they need to try for themselves now [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3692.6s)]
*  with so much lobbying and stuff going on? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3695.88s)]
*  Like, what would you tell them? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3697.4s)]
*  All right, first of all, what you're involved in [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3700.2s)]
*  is some politics would change. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3703.3599999999997s)]
*  And being elected official is one way of bringing [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3705.96s)]
*  about the change, but it's not the only way. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3708.48s)]
*  You know, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3710.24s)]
*  was never elected anything, right? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3711.8799999999997s)]
*  He had a profound impact on this country. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3713.64s)]
*  Never raped in anything, all right? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3715.48s)]
*  Oh, and you're seeing young people who are concerned [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3717.8399999999997s)]
*  about climate change on campuses, the limited work. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3720.68s)]
*  So go with your passions. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3723.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, your passion may be different than mine. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3725.3599999999997s)]
*  What's your issue? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3726.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know this. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3727.68s)]
*  So work on that issue, greet people, educate, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3728.52s)]
*  organize, greet people. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3732.32s)]
*  And if you then decide, hey, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3733.8s)]
*  maybe I'll run for the state legislature. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3735.64s)]
*  Remember I'll run for pundits. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3737.32s)]
*  I wanna get my hands dirty in politics. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3738.7599999999998s)]
*  Do it. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3744.24s)]
*  But first of all, don't do it just because [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3745.08s)]
*  I wanna get elected. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3746.92s)]
*  That's bad, right? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3748.4s)]
*  Do it because you believe in so-and-so. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3749.8s)]
*  And getting elected will help you do it fine. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3752.2s)]
*  If not, you can do it in other ways. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3754.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3756.96s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, thank you so much for your time, man. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3759.08s)]
*  Oh, thank you very much. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3761.12s)]
*  Let me just say this. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3762.44s)]
*  Congratulations on your program. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3763.28s)]
*  And more programs like this do. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3765.6s)]
*  I'm on TV a lot. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3767.44s)]
*  We only get seven seconds to make a point. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3768.44s)]
*  Can't make it seven seconds. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3770.52s)]
*  So we argue you can have a serious discussion [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3772.44s)]
*  about serious issues is really great. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3775.04s)]
*  I thank you for the opportunity [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3776.92s)]
*  and thank you for what you do. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3778.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3779.72s)]
*  I've always been a proponent [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3780.56s)]
*  and thank you for just being an outspoken person [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3781.38s)]
*  who believes in things and moves forward with those beliefs. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3782.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm just floating on the breeze [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3785.96s)]
*  and I feel I'm falling like these leaves. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3788.2s)]
*  For 50 years now, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3791.2s)]
*  hip hop has been a reflection of culture and society. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3793.12s)]
*  That includes stories of struggle and pain. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3796.32s)]
*  Social injustice. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3798.96s)]
*  Racial inequality. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3799.8s)]
*  The marginalization of communities. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3800.96s)]
*  Today, we confront a healthcare system [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3803.2400000000002s)]
*  that has been rigged against all of us. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3805.76s)]
*  Hospitals force patients to sign contracts for services. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3807.64s)]
*  Without ever showing us actual prices. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3810.64s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3813.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3814.08s)]
*  Stifling competition. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3815.88s)]
*  Overcharging without accountability. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3817.08s)]
*  And if we can't pay, these same contracts [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3819.64s)]
*  allow them to take everything we own. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3822.44s)]
*  Creating so much fear [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3824.6s)]
*  that millions and millions of Americans [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3826.28s)]
*  refuse to enter a hospital. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3828.32s)]
*  Putting our health and our lives at stake. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3829.84s)]
*  This is an American humanitarian crisis. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3833.48s)]
*  We love our nurses. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3836.96s)]
*  And we need our doctors. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3837.96s)]
*  But the hospitals and assurances [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3839.16s)]
*  rigging a system to make profits off of people [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3840.84s)]
*  that say struggle is unforgivable. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3844.6s)]
*  We demand prices. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3847.04s)]
*  And transparency in healthcare. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3848.24s)]
*  Power to the patients. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ&t=3850.52s)]
