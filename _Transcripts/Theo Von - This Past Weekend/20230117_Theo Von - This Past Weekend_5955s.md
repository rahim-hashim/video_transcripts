*  I don't know if people say stop drinking water past like 7pm or some shit. I just love water. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=117.0s)]
*  People are like, yo, you need to drink more water and shit. They always complain, but I don't have that issue, honestly. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=118.0s)]
*  I'm just a hydrated guy straight up. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=122.0s)]
*  Really? Oh wow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=124.0s)]
*  I'd say so. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=126.0s)]
*  That's good. I think it's good. Do you like to swim though? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=127.0s)]
*  If it's hot out. I'm not the best swimmer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=131.0s)]
*  I'll get in there and do a little front crawl. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=139.0s)]
*  A little doggy paddle. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=140.0s)]
*  I'm not the best swimmer. I'm usually kind of in the urban section or whatever. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=141.0s)]
*  What does that mean? Like people that can't swim? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=146.0s)]
*  I don't know. I wouldn't say that, but I would say like, yeah, if they had like a Memphis area of the pool, I think that's kind of where I'm usually hanging out at. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=148.0s)]
*  I feel you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=156.0s)]
*  When I get into the deep end, it is like I'm swimming with every, my legs become arms. It's almost like I'm trying to stay out of the water. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=157.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=165.0s)]
*  I feel you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=166.0s)]
*  Kyle Forgard, thanks for being here, man. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=167.0s)]
*  Appreciate it, bro. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah. Good to see you, dude. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=171.0s)]
*  So I just wanted to start. Some of my audience and some people in the world, I think you hear NELC all the time, right? So just what is it? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=172.0s)]
*  I guess there's different layers to NELC. I guess like the content side, NELC is like, you know, it's a group of guys basically just doing stupid shit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=181.0s)]
*  I guess people say that we're this generation's jackass, which is like a huge compliment, I'd say too. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=190.0s)]
*  But I mean, I think they do more like crazier stunts, like shit we could never do. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=195.0s)]
*  And we're more like kind of pranks and partying and just honestly just like vlogging our life type shit. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=200.0s)]
*  And yeah, we have a big YouTube channel that has like almost eight million subscribers now, which we started ten years ago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=206.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=212.0s)]
*  So we have that. We're just uploading funny shit on Instagram, YouTube. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah, the kind of I think what separates us is like we never really made a lot of money off YouTube because we were quote unquote R rated. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=217.0s)]
*  Oh, because they flag it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=224.0s)]
*  Because they flagged it. Yeah. So, you know, everyone complains now like, oh, I don't make money off YouTube. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=225.0s)]
*  But to me, that's like an old song and dance. Like we've been dealing with that for like our whole career. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=229.0s)]
*  So for me, that's like repetitive to hear now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=234.0s)]
*  So but it was kind of a blessing in disguise because we had to get smart and kind of build businesses around our content in order to like, you know, fund our operation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=236.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=245.0s)]
*  So I think the fact that we weren't making money, like our fans really no one understood it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=246.0s)]
*  They're like, why? Like, why can't they just find ads that are like 18 plus or some shit? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=251.0s)]
*  But there was no ads ever. So we kind of just started our own businesses like merch. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=255.0s)]
*  And yeah, I think people really fucked with it. You know, we were kind of like the underdogs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=260.0s)]
*  Ah, I see. So yeah, there was that. Yeah, because like the send it full sent all of that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=264.0s)]
*  That became a lot of y'alls. That was like one of the merch lines, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah, full send. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=271.0s)]
*  That's like something that I don't know if we invented it, but we kind of like coined it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah. And shit. And we started saying it in videos and then it kind of became something bigger than us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I was at a funeral one time in the kid was yeah, it was like a like a 22 year old dude. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=280.0s)]
*  He's getting buried and his stepdad was like sent send him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=285.0s)]
*  He sent it. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, damn, bro. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=290.0s)]
*  That funeral was probably lit. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=294.0s)]
*  I was like fucking turn up, dude. I was at a funeral one time and they the DJ or whatever had like a stroke or something in there, dude. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=295.0s)]
*  And he like when he hit the machine, it played like a Nelly song in the fucking in the service, you know, it was that song like Apple Bottom Jean. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=305.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? That's low by T-Pain. Oh, sorry. So that's what it was. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=315.0s)]
*  It was. Yeah. So everybody's just sitting there and people's crying and stuff and fucking Randall's dead, dude. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=318.0s)]
*  And every suddenly you just hear a fucking like what's going on? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=323.0s)]
*  And people are like yelling or like kind of pointing over that area in the guy in there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=327.0s)]
*  I mean, it's sad, but he'd had a stroke, you know, and really like, yeah, because he was just, you know, running the I guess had an electric organ or whatever, you know, but that's I don't know. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=331.0s)]
*  God sometimes like has like funny stuff he does. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=340.0s)]
*  So how did Nelk start? I just because I think there's a lot of audience that doesn't know, you know, I just want my audience to sometimes I'll do the best job of like getting to. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=344.0s)]
*  To know who the guest is and where they're at, you know? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=352.0s)]
*  Yeah, it started. I mean, I've just been making videos ever since I was young, like grade five, grade six, just like fucking around with the camera, making like funny shit and then like little even like short films and then just uploading them on Facebook and shit like that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=356.0s)]
*  I probably honestly if we found the Facebook ones, I think I'd be canceled for sure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=371.0s)]
*  Like, you know, the humor back then to like, yeah, I still like, yeah, you probably do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=375.0s)]
*  But like gay jokes could fly and shit like crazy shit. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=380.0s)]
*  I remember what we were doing, but shit like that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=383.0s)]
*  Just messing around with friends, making funny skits and shit. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=386.0s)]
*  And then getting into YouTube and in high school, I was kind of always good at video, like all sides of video, like the filmmaking side to like editing, directing and shit like that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=388.0s)]
*  Yes, I have your touch on it. I think especially if you're creative, you have to be able to do that kind of stuff. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=399.0s)]
*  That was the thing with YouTube to everyone that was coming up like you got to be multi layered. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=403.0s)]
*  You got to have the on camera shit and then you got to also be able to be your own producer, right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=407.0s)]
*  That's all the YouTubers that make it kind of do both. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=412.0s)]
*  So I was good at both. I always knew I was going to do something in film and I was like applying to go to film school and shit. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=415.0s)]
*  But we started uploading shit on YouTube and it slowly started getting traction, like 10K views and then 50K views. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=422.0s)]
*  So huge. Remember your first 10K? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=429.0s)]
*  Bro, it's sick. And there was this thing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=431.0s)]
*  Did you jerk off, you think? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=433.0s)]
*  Did I jerk off to the views? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=435.0s)]
*  I mean not to them, but when you saw. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=436.0s)]
*  I think I might have jerked to my first YouTube check. It was like a grand. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=438.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=441.0s)]
*  That thing's damn, cuz. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=443.0s)]
*  Bro, it was lit. And it was like, it was called like the YouTube Partner Program. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=445.0s)]
*  And I saw like other YouTubers, they were like making a living off YouTube. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=448.0s)]
*  And I was like, no fucking way you can like make a living off YouTube. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=452.0s)]
*  Like you just get paid to upload fucking YouTube videos. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=457.0s)]
*  Like that sounds like the dream to me. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=460.0s)]
*  So we kept applying and we kept getting denied. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=462.0s)]
*  And then eventually we got it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=465.0s)]
*  So we would start making like a thousand bucks a month, two thousand bucks a month. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=467.0s)]
*  You know, like just enough to kind of like, you know, just fund some shit, like do videos and shit. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=470.0s)]
*  And then. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=475.0s)]
*  Well then you're a business at that point. You become a businessman. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=476.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so, right? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=479.0s)]
*  Like in a way it's like business, you know, it's like you start to create something, it makes some money. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=480.0s)]
*  And then that's when you're like, okay, now this is a business. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=483.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I was in film school and shit. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=486.0s)]
*  And I told my parents, I was like, I think the videos are getting like, you know, a hundred thousand views. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=488.0s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I think if I want to ever do be my own boss and do anything in this fucking like genre or whatever, I think this is the way to go. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=493.0s)]
*  Just like build my own shit, be my own boss. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=502.0s)]
*  And then I can kind of do whatever I want when I kind of make it right. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=505.0s)]
*  And what was their response to that? Were they? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=509.0s)]
*  They believed in me because yeah, they kind of believed in me and they saw like the money coming in. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=511.0s)]
*  I think it was like blind faith, to be honest, which is cool. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=515.0s)]
*  Like a lot of people say like my parents never fucking supported me, but mine was like the opposite. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=518.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=522.0s)]
*  So it's pretty cool. But and then we moved to LA. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=523.0s)]
*  I worked at a golf course, so I saved up like all summer, just fucking slaving at the golf course. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=526.0s)]
*  And were you meeting, was there some cool people you would see at the golf course? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=531.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It was like all my buddies. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=534.0s)]
*  I think like actually, yeah, four people that work for us now, they worked for me. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=536.0s)]
*  They worked with me at the golf course. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=540.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=542.0s)]
*  I have six of my Canadian buddies from back home and they all work with us now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=543.0s)]
*  They all live in Cali too, which is sick. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=547.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=549.0s)]
*  Yeah, the golf course was lit though. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=550.0s)]
*  We need more Canadian imports too because it's kind of not fair. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=552.0s)]
*  Mexican does all these people. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=554.0s)]
*  There's so many importing of Mexicans, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=556.0s)]
*  There is a lot of Canadians though too. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=558.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I'd love to see a ton of them just rush over the woods at one point. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=560.0s)]
*  Like one of those, what's it called, those, what did Trump call it? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=563.0s)]
*  When like a shit ton of them come across the border at once. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=567.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, like a migrant. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=570.0s)]
*  What's the word? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=572.0s)]
*  Like a coutblian? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=573.0s)]
*  Like a wave? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=574.0s)]
*  No, he called it something like, it was a really good name. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=575.0s)]
*  It was? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=577.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=578.0s)]
*  Can you look it up for us, Zach? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=579.0s)]
*  I think it's like a quinceañer. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=580.0s)]
*  I don't know, it depends on how old they are. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=582.0s)]
*  But yeah, one of those, there's like a huge, that would be pretty cool. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=584.0s)]
*  Dude, if you had a bunch of Canadians roll in, dude. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=588.0s)]
*  We should kind of organize that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=590.0s)]
*  And then they had to fight in fucking like Ohio or something. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=591.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=594.0s)]
*  And then what the, like ICE has to go to the Canadian border and like keep everyone out. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=595.0s)]
*  That'd be pretty cool. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=599.0s)]
*  Dude, how weird will it get when we have to hire ISIS to come protect our borders? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=600.0s)]
*  ISIS or ICE? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=603.0s)]
*  Oh, both probably. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=604.0s)]
*  I mean, it's getting pretty dicey down there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=606.0s)]
*  We had a border patrol agent on and he said, it's just crazy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=607.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=610.0s)]
*  Bro, he said it's bananas. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=611.0s)]
*  He said, well, first of all, the cartels own a lot of the land by the border or they like hypothetically own it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=613.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=619.0s)]
*  So if you're bringing across an, I don't know what we call it, illegal alien, a migrant, somebody who's coming in. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=620.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=627.0s)]
*  Then you have to pay those. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=628.0s)]
*  The cartels have to be paid for you to use that part of the land to get to the border. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=629.0s)]
*  So there's all. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=634.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=636.0s)]
*  So there's like a whole, there's little levels of business that are going on on that side. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=637.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=640.0s)]
*  And then a lot of times that you pay a certain amount and they just guarantee that they'll get you to the border. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=641.0s)]
*  It's like. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=647.0s)]
*  So this is like Mexicans paying to come to the US. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=648.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=650.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=651.0s)]
*  And then you got to pay, it's like an extra, like sometimes they'll hit you at the last minute. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=652.0s)]
*  It's like 200 more if you want to get over. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=654.0s)]
*  You're like, what the. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=656.0s)]
*  So the cartels making money off all these people traveling, trying to like escape to the US. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=657.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=662.0s)]
*  So it's just a whole fucking money grab. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=663.0s)]
*  It's a huge racket. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=665.0s)]
*  And then a lot of times they'll get. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=666.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=667.0s)]
*  They'll get people there and then they, if they get busted, a lot of times the problem that the guy was saying was that they don't, there's no prosecution. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=668.0s)]
*  There's no follow up by the US. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=676.0s)]
*  So the border police are like last or whatever. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=678.0s)]
*  I don't know how they have to do it now. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=680.0s)]
*  But. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=681.0s)]
*  But then they don't get prosecuted. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=682.0s)]
*  So like a month later, it's the same dude running across with that shit to me is like, I'm Canadian too, but I mean, it's so crazy at the US like isn't allowed to have like a border. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=685.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=694.0s)]
*  It's so to me, like it's so dumb how people don't understand that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=695.0s)]
*  Like it's not like you're racist or anything. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=699.0s)]
*  It's just like every country has to have a border. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=701.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=704.0s)]
*  You have to have like a organized system. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=705.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=707.0s)]
*  Like Ronald Reagan had a, there was, I think it was during the Reagan administration and maybe Zach, you can look this up where they had, you got to sponsor someone who was coming across. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=708.0s)]
*  So say you were a family that could take care of yourself or that was big hearted, you know, you could say, okay, we're going to sponsor Ector, you know, or Oscar, you know, and he's going to come stay with us and we're going to, you know, he's going to have like a, like a, not like a parole officer, but almost like this social parole officer here in the US. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=716.0s)]
*  So that there's a level of connection. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=735.0s)]
*  So then like the ICE or whoever the authorities would have this American person that's connected to the person who's coming over. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=739.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like a program, you know? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=748.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=750.0s)]
*  I mean, you've got to have some sort of system, right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=751.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=752.0s)]
*  Amnesty for illegal immigrants. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=753.0s)]
*  Let me see it at the nations. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=754.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=755.0s)]
*  So basically Ronald Reagan cracked down on that, but he did have a thing that if you were in there before 1982, you had Amnesty, which is kind of not protocol for the right typically. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=756.0s)]
*  But I think you're right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=766.0s)]
*  He did have like a program where you can sponsor people. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=767.0s)]
*  There was a program. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=769.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=770.0s)]
*  Anyway, it's just been interesting what went on down there. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=771.0s)]
*  But, okay, so we have NELC, you guys get it put together in Canada, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=777.0s)]
*  And then you're doing good. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=778.0s)]
*  Now, at that point, when you roll out of here and you decide to come to LA, did your whole family come? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=779.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=783.0s)]
*  I have my ex, myself, Jesse, who used to be with us. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=784.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=786.0s)]
*  And two other guys. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=787.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=788.0s)]
*  So yeah, Jesse came with us too. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=789.0s)]
*  And yeah, I think I was like 19 at the time. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=790.0s)]
*  I'm 28 now. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=793.0s)]
*  So it was almost 10 years ago. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=794.0s)]
*  It's crazy to think of, bro. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=796.0s)]
*  And yeah, we like just going to LA, you know, like landing at the airport, you see the palm trees and shit. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=797.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=802.0s)]
*  And yeah, we were pretty broke at the time. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=803.0s)]
*  Like we saved up money and shit. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=805.0s)]
*  But also if you're Canadian, you can't sign a full year lease because like you don't have a SIN number or anything like that. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=807.0s)]
*  So we got rinsed with the fucking like short term rental shit too. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=813.0s)]
*  So it was like kind of expensive to stay, you know? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=817.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because they bite you pretty hard on that. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=819.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=821.0s)]
*  So we had to deal with that too. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=822.0s)]
*  And then, but yeah, we hit like our first like viral video. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=824.0s)]
*  We did like the coke prank on cops. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=827.0s)]
*  I don't know if you ever seen that one. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=829.0s)]
*  We put like a bunch of Coca-Cola in the trunk of a car. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=830.0s)]
*  And then we like parked in a suspicious area. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=834.0s)]
*  And then we told the cops we had cocaine and they arrested us. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=838.0s)]
*  And then they saw the Coca-Cola. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=841.0s)]
*  That one has got like 50 million views now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=843.0s)]
*  Fuck, it's so crazy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=845.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was our first big one. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=846.0s)]
*  What is something like that gets 50 million views earn you? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=847.0s)]
*  Like what can earn you? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=850.0s)]
*  I don't think we didn't make anything off that. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=852.0s)]
*  But theoretically, I guess 50 mil. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=854.0s)]
*  I mean, some people make a thousand per million at the lowest, but you could make you can make like five thousand per million. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=858.0s)]
*  So that could be anywhere from 50k to 250k. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=865.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=868.0s)]
*  But then it also does get your name out there, which also has just as much value. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=869.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=873.0s)]
*  Either way, there's a lot of value with it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=874.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think honestly, we might not even be here if we got paid off YouTube because you get really comfortable to write a lot of those kids fell off that like they were making a lot of money off YouTube. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=875.0s)]
*  And now they're kind of nowhere to be found. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=884.0s)]
*  So I hope they like saved up money and shit. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=885.0s)]
*  Yeah, or you knock a chick up. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=887.0s)]

[[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=894.0s)]
*  And also, we couldn't really afford it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=908.0s)]
*  So we'd go back to Canada, live at our parents' house and shit always slowed down when we went home. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=909.0s)]

*  And I actually used to do a bit about this. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1485.0s)]
*  It was a family that owned a pumpkin patch, which was insane because it was like the biggest vegetable in the world, right? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1486.0s)]
*  So like there was like a family of small people in Oregon and they owned a pumpkin patch. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1491.0s)]
*  Can you bring that up, Zach? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1497.0s)]
*  There they are. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1499.0s)]
*  And half the family was little. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1501.0s)]
*  And they slanked pumpkins. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1503.0s)]
*  And the tall dude smashes, I think. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1505.0s)]
*  So he's the only tall guy. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1508.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the sister too was tall, I think. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1511.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1513.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1515.0s)]
*  But they would like... [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1516.0s)]
*  That'd be interesting. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1518.0s)]
*  I know being a little person would be weird. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1519.0s)]
*  But what if your father was a little person and you weren't? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1521.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1526.0s)]
*  I've never thought about that. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1527.0s)]
*  I've never seen that before, actually. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1528.0s)]
*  I don't know. That's just kind of interesting. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1530.0s)]
*  Yeah, this was a big show for a long time. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1531.0s)]
*  And you just follow the family. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1533.0s)]
*  And the father and mother always had discrepancies. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1535.0s)]
*  But yeah, they had... [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1540.0s)]
*  And they may have had one other son who was regular heighted. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1541.0s)]
*  But yeah, that'd be so wild if your dad was little. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1544.0s)]
*  Because you always feel like you were probably going... [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1546.0s)]
*  Like he's trying to ground you and shit. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1549.0s)]
*  And you're like, Dad, watch your tone and shit. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1551.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1553.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1554.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1555.0s)]
*  Or if you come home drunk one time, you're like, no way. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1556.0s)]
*  You're like, Dad, just step aside. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1558.0s)]
*  You're not going to do shit. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1560.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1561.0s)]
*  It's kind of hot in here. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1563.0s)]
*  Are you hot? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1564.0s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1565.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1566.0s)]
*  So take us through what happens then. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1567.0s)]
*  So how does the podcast kind of start? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1569.0s)]
*  Do you partner up with someone once you guys start getting all this traction? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1570.0s)]
*  How do you kind of like get your business to the next level? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1573.0s)]
*  Because now you're on the Forbes list, right? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1575.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1578.0s)]
*  Last year. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1579.0s)]
*  For 30... [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1580.0s)]
*  30 under 30? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1582.0s)]
*  That's unreal. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1583.0s)]
*  I actually don't know what that means, but I don't know. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1584.0s)]
*  I feel like it's kind of political. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1585.0s)]
*  But hey, I'll fucking take it, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1586.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1588.0s)]
*  I don't know how it works. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1589.0s)]
*  And is that even you in that picture? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1590.0s)]
*  That's me. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1591.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1592.0s)]
*  It doesn't even look like you. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1594.0s)]
*  I think that was a few years ago. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1595.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1596.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1597.0s)]
*  I don't know what Forbes 30 under 30 is, but it sounds good, right? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1600.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1601.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1602.0s)]
*  But it's like how do you... [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1603.0s)]
*  A lot of chicks hit me up about it and shit, so... [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1604.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1606.0s)]
*  It sounds good. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1607.0s)]
*  I don't know how I got it, but fuck it. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1608.0s)]
*  But how... [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1609.0s)]
*  So how do you get from where your channel is going well, you guys are doing well, to [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1610.0s)]
*  turning that into a bigger business? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1613.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1615.0s)]
*  I guess the big play that for us was the Happy Dad stuff, for sure. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1616.0s)]
*  Our merch was always killing it too. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1622.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1624.0s)]
*  Our merch was killing it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1625.0s)]
*  But yeah, Happy Dad is something that I've definitely always wanted to do. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1626.0s)]
*  My whole goal is to... [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1630.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to build a big long-term business that could outlive me or outlive [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1632.0s)]
*  anyone part of the crew. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1638.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1640.0s)]
*  Just build something bigger. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1641.0s)]
*  But yeah, Happy Dad, we always wanted to do our own alcohol because we're always drinking [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1642.0s)]
*  and shit, drinking in the videos. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1645.0s)]
*  So we either wanted to get a deal or start our own. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1647.0s)]
*  And we were repping Corona a lot at the time, but we were too edgy to get a deal from Corona. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1650.0s)]
*  Which is crazy because Corona is Mexico. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1656.0s)]
*  It's like, have you fucking been to Mexico? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1658.0s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1660.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's glass in the sand. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1661.0s)]
*  But like, no, the alcohol industry is like, it's so political and so like, you know, in [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1662.0s)]
*  terms of advertising. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1668.0s)]
*  So I understand, but it kind of sucked. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1669.0s)]
*  Yeah, we wanted to do something with Corona, but they never did it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1671.0s)]
*  And then a few other people approached us. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1674.0s)]
*  We used to be like WME, and they were trying to get us to start an alcohol, but it never [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1676.0s)]
*  went anywhere. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1681.0s)]
*  And then I met John and Sam, John and Sam Shihidi at dinner, and they were interested [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1682.0s)]
*  in working with us. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1688.0s)]
*  And they said, yo, like, is there any way we can help? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1689.0s)]
*  Anything you guys need help with? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1692.0s)]
*  And I just told them straight up, like, I was like, yo, I want to start a fucking alcohol. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1693.0s)]
*  I was like, if you guys could do it, if you guys want to project manage that for us, I [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1697.0s)]
*  was like, let's fucking do it. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1700.0s)]
*  So they found these two guys, the Butao brothers and their family. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1702.0s)]
*  They've been in like the alcohol industry. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1706.0s)]
*  They're big drinkers. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1708.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1709.0s)]
*  We started taste testing it and shit, and it took us like a whole year. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1710.0s)]
*  So we started from like a point, tested it, said, change this, change this, change this, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1713.0s)]
*  another test, same shit. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1718.0s)]
*  And it took us like eight different times over like a year to get to like the product [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1720.0s)]
*  that we have now that we really like. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1724.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1726.0s)]
*  And yeah, that's just going crazy. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1727.0s)]

*  Steve shows up somewhere. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1737.0s)]
*  It's a big shake and hands business, alcohol. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1738.0s)]
*  It's like an old school business. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1740.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1741.0s)]

*  Like you got to go and put in the work physically and like shake hands, meet people. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1746.0s)]
*  Like the social media aspect is one thing, but like you got to show up places. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1750.0s)]
*  You got to travel. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1754.0s)]

*  Is it? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1756.0s)]
*  It's an old school business. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1757.0s)]
*  Has it been a lot busy as once that became part of it, did things get a lot busier than [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1758.0s)]
*  you expected? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1762.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1763.0s)]
*  And then, cause it used to just be NELC. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1764.0s)]
*  We'd upload a video like every week. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1765.0s)]
*  But then yeah, with happy dad and then now the podcast too, it's like a lot of traveling [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1767.0s)]
*  moving around, especially with the pod. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1772.0s)]
*  Like if we want to get the best guests, sometimes you only get 24 hours notice. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1774.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1778.0s)]
*  Like if fucking Elon Musk says like, yo, I want to do this. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1779.0s)]
*  Like we got to fly to Texas, jump on a plane, wait around for a few days. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1781.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1785.0s)]
*  You just got to be on the ball and be prepared. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1786.0s)]
*  Did you guys have to wait for Elon? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1788.0s)]
*  We did. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1790.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1791.0s)]
*  It was funny story. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1792.0s)]
*  I told it before, but um, what happened was like we, I think it was Sandy. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1793.0s)]
*  I think it was Sam's birthday. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1796.0s)]
*  So we took a jet to Texas. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1797.0s)]
*  Um, and then we had no service. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1799.0s)]
*  So right when we landed, we got, it was so crazy cause John got like two texts, uh, Steve's [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1802.0s)]
*  channels deleted, like YouTube called them and said Steve's channels deleted. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1808.0s)]
*  And the second message was, uh, Elon messaged him and says, why is my security telling me [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1813.0s)]
*  that one of the guys on your crew is a security threat? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1818.0s)]
*  And we're like, what? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1822.0s)]
*  Like, what are we talking, what are they talking about? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1823.0s)]
*  And then they said like, Steven, deal an artist. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1825.0s)]
*  And we're like, what? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1827.0s)]
*  And then, um, then we kind of put it together. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1828.0s)]
*  Steve in the past, when Bitcoin crashed, he made like a funny video, like shitting on [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1832.0s)]
*  Elon and he like blew up a Tesla. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1836.0s)]
*  And I think he was like, he has like a mannequin of Elon and he was like shooting guns out [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1838.0s)]
*  of it. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1844.0s)]
*  So like, I guess the security, they don't know, right? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1845.0s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1847.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1848.0s)]
*  And they probably think that's, they just see this guy shooting a fucking assault rifle [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1849.0s)]
*  at Elon and shit and asking the flight, the pilots, like what's his flight schedule and [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1852.0s)]
*  shit. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1856.0s)]
*  So they saw that and they basically like, Elon's like, our whole team was set up at [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1857.0s)]
*  his house. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1862.0s)]
*  Like they, they were with his kids and like his, one of his wives or whatever. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1863.0s)]
*  And, um, they w they had to leave and pack up and leave. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1867.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1870.0s)]
*  And then Steve was like, I feel so bad. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1871.0s)]
*  Like, and he was also like so down about his channel. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1873.0s)]
*  So he's like, yo, I'm, I'm gonna sit this one out. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1876.0s)]
*  Like, I can't even do this anyway. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1878.0s)]
*  Like I'm so pissed off. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1879.0s)]
*  And then, um, we kept messaging Elon back and forth and like, it went down like 48 hours [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1881.0s)]
*  later. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1886.0s)]
*  He just ran him. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1887.0s)]
*  He was like, maybe he kept, he just sends like one or two word answers with periods [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1888.0s)]
*  every time only by email too. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1891.0s)]
*  And then eventually he's just like, all right, let's do it. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1894.0s)]
*  And then he just pulled up and he stayed for four hours. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1896.0s)]
*  No, but it almost, it almost didn't go down. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1899.0s)]
*  And when he pulled up, who went to meet him first? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1902.0s)]
*  Did you guys, how do you were just sitting in that room right there? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1904.0s)]
*  And he just walked in just with one guy. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1907.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1909.0s)]
*  Just walked in and he probably crushed like six happy dads. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1910.0s)]
*  No. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1913.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1914.0s)]
*  He drinks a lot. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1916.0s)]
*  He, he's definitely an undercover party. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1917.0s)]
*  Does he? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1918.0s)]
*  I don't even know about undercover, but. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1919.0s)]
*  Oh, I've heard some, I heard a great story. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1920.0s)]
*  A buddy of mine went to like a party his whenever he worked. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1922.0s)]
*  I think whenever he was seeing like Amber Heard's, right? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1926.0s)]
*  And he like asked him if he wanted some spaghetti or something. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1929.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1933.0s)]
*  He asked my buddy if he wanted some spaghetti and he's like, uh, yeah, I'll have some spaghetti. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1934.0s)]
*  And so then he just like took some off of his plate on a fork and like put it in my buddy's mouth. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1938.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1942.0s)]
*  Instead of like making him some spaghetti, like, you know, I think it seemed like, do you want me to get you some spaghetti? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1943.0s)]
*  He's, he's a, he's a different kind of guy. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1949.0s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1951.0s)]
*  And maybe it is more efficient. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1952.0s)]
*  Maybe he's just all about efficiency. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1953.0s)]
*  You know, it's just like, it's probably more efficient if I just give you some spaghetti that I have and see if you want more spaghetti, then go get you a possibly wasteful amount of spaghetti. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1955.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1964.0s)]
*  You know, but yeah, my buddy said that that was so crazy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1965.0s)]
*  And then there was a party where like people would just kind of go around with like a little drug cart and they had like different like, he's a big drug cart guy for sure. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1967.0s)]
*  Oh, I think you gotta be. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1974.0s)]
*  He reaches his fingers in and kind of, you know, takes his time, makes a good decision. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1976.0s)]
*  Oh, I bet he puts all the coke out of the bag and touches it and then puts it back in the bag. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1980.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1984.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1985.0s)]
*  Mixes it up with some Molly. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1986.0s)]
*  But I feel like- [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1988.0s)]
*  Boys back home call that a rattlesnake. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1989.0s)]
*  They do? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1991.0s)]
*  Molly and cocaine together. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1992.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1993.0s)]
*  Rattlesnakes. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1994.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1995.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think if I've ever done anything like that. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1996.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=1999.0s)]
*  No, I saw a guy get bit by a rattlesnake one time. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2001.0s)]
*  I had to work with this dude Ronnie, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2004.0s)]
*  And he had some kind of, I don't know, he was impaired or something, but he couldn't do, he couldn't swallow, right? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2007.0s)]
*  So like whenever it was like we would do yard work together. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2014.0s)]
*  And so when like he'd get thirsty, you'd have to fucking give him the water and then kind of like, you know, he'd have to like kind of maneuver more, you know? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2018.0s)]
*  Sometimes we'd fucking put that hose in him, bro, and fucking forget about it. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2025.0s)]
*  We start playing a game of pool or something and that dude's over there halfway to heaven, bro, drowning out, bro. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2030.0s)]
*  But that was a simpler time. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2037.0s)]
*  So then naturally what took y'all to another business level was doing that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2039.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2044.0s)]
*  Because then you're an alcohol brand, then you're obviously a bit, you know, you're like you're pushing like, I mean, you guys are everywhere. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2045.0s)]
*  That's the big play. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2051.0s)]
*  I think that's our, I mean, I know that's our billion dollar play, hopefully multi-billion dollar play if we just keep the momentum going. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2052.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2059.0s)]
*  But it all comes down to we still got to make funny videos. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2060.0s)]
*  We still got to do what we've always been doing. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2062.0s)]
*  But I think that's our big play for sure. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2064.0s)]
*  Does it feel harder to evolve? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2067.0s)]
*  Like, do you think about how things need to evolve? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2069.0s)]
*  Because I find a lot of times I'm like, do I stay in this space that I'm in and where things seem good and comfortable? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2074.0s)]
*  Do I also recognize that like my audience will be getting older as I get older? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2082.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2086.0s)]
*  And how do I manage that? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2087.0s)]
*  And how do I even evolve as a person? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2088.0s)]
*  I know it's tough, right? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2091.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2092.0s)]
*  And then it's like you have your own personal kind of life and your own personal feelings. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2093.0s)]
*  But do you put that aside for the camera? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2096.0s)]
*  Do you ever struggle with that too, like type shit? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2099.0s)]
*  Like what people want to see sometimes is maybe not what you're actually kind of feeling off camera type shit. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2101.0s)]
*  I think I try to stay pretty clear on kind of what's going on. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2108.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2112.0s)]
*  Because it keeps me in a space. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2113.0s)]
*  But that's also, this is a channel where it's like kind of, it was kind of built that way. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2114.0s)]
*  Whereas I think, yeah, you guys are more of like a entertainment. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2118.0s)]
*  We're here. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2122.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2123.0s)]
*  Somebody's going to die soon. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2124.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2125.0s)]
*  Like fucking, you know. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2126.0s)]
*  I think, we used to do every week on the main Nelk channel, which was like our vlog, whatever. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2127.0s)]
*  But now we're just doing like once a month because it's just like, yeah, I think for me now I've done it so long too, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2132.0s)]
*  where it's not possible to do every week and it's not possible to put out a fire video every week. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2138.0s)]
*  So for me, it's just more satisfying now to do like one good video a month, you know, and do something crazy. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2145.0s)]

*  That's the thing too. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2252.0s)]
*  I think not just Stani, but yeah, employees are on talent. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2253.0s)]
*  People get very comfortable, very quick. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2257.0s)]
*  Oh, they get in the cloud. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2259.0s)]
*  And people get cloudy real quick. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2260.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2262.0s)]
*  That's kind of a tough thing to cause I've long tried to find an assistant. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2263.0s)]
*  And it's tough to find like, like an on camera partner, you know, and it's like, it's tough [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2265.0s)]
*  because you like try to couple people and some of them are kind of cloudy and like, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2270.0s)]
*  oh, this isn't, they don't get it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2273.0s)]
*  You don't have an assistant right now? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2274.0s)]
*  I feel like I have the best assistant. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2276.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2279.0s)]
*  He's like, he's gay and Brazilian. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2280.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2281.0s)]
*  I think, I think gay males make the best assistants. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2282.0s)]
*  Gay males. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2286.0s)]
*  Not to be like sexist or anything, but because. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2287.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, look, I'm glad. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2289.0s)]
*  Because like, you know, like a girl, if you're a girl, like he can pick up shit. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2290.0s)]
*  Like he's still a guy. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2294.0s)]
*  So like if you have a female assistant, they'll use the female card sometimes and be like, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2295.0s)]
*  yo, I'm not picking up that box, like type shit. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2299.0s)]
*  So you got the guy aspect. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2301.0s)]
*  He's strong. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2302.0s)]
*  He can do all that shit. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2303.0s)]
*  But then if you're like sick or some shit, the feminine side comes out and he'll, you know, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2304.0s)]

*  Do I want tea with honey? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2309.0s)]

*  Wow. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2315.0s)]

*  So he's like the gay guy too. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2327.0s)]
*  We're like, I think he's honestly like transphobic and shit too. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2328.0s)]
*  Oh, so he's like he, you know, he doesn't like guys that like paint their nails and shit too. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2331.0s)]

*  Probably. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2405.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2406.0s)]
*  It was Obama. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2407.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was during Obama. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2408.0s)]
*  But I think in the black community, they're not as accepting of gays in a lot of ways. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2409.0s)]
*  They call them punks. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2414.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2415.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2416.0s)]
*  Well, all the rappers would like, they've dropped like homophobic shit all the time. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2417.0s)]
*  Like Lil Wayne's dropped it so much. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2422.0s)]
*  They can be 50 Cent. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2424.0s)]
*  Boosie's always on it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2425.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2427.0s)]
*  Man, come on, man. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2428.0s)]
*  Boosie's fucking ridiculous. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2430.0s)]
*  I guess black people don't like gay people. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2431.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2434.0s)]
*  I think they just don't. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2435.0s)]
*  But that's why they need that conquistador gay dude. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2436.0s)]
*  That's what I loved about Tiger King. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2439.0s)]
*  It was like, all right, now we got to fuck. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2440.0s)]
*  Because he's gay, right? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2443.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2444.0s)]
*  Now we got to, there's a fucking fly in the soup right here, dude. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2448.0s)]
*  He was shooting people and fucking and doing drug and fucking, you know, eating tiger meat and shit. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2449.0s)]
*  He was doing it, man. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2455.0s)]
*  He was like, I'm a fucking gay boy. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2456.0s)]
*  You know, he was like a wild west gay. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2459.0s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2462.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2463.0s)]
*  Do you think there's a lot of, and I know you probably see this more because you're getting, I mean, you were, how much is your business worth now? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2465.0s)]
*  Do they say that? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2472.0s)]
*  I think Happy Dad alone this year will be worth 250 million. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2473.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2478.0s)]
*  Evaluation. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2479.0s)]
*  And that's awesome, man. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2480.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2481.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of wealth induced homosexuality. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2482.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2489.0s)]
*  It means you get so wealthy and you've had so many opportunities with women. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2490.0s)]
*  Like you just turned gay? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2494.0s)]
*  It happened in Rome. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2495.0s)]
*  It happened in Rome. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2496.0s)]
*  The people were so powerful. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2497.0s)]
*  They had sex with all the women that they started having sex with men. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2498.0s)]
*  Because you hear that a lot in like Hollywood and shit, right? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2505.0s)]
*  Like I heard like P. Diddy's gay or some shit or like. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2506.0s)]
*  Yeah, you hear P. Diddy. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2508.0s)]
*  Who else do you hear a lot of times? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2509.0s)]
*  Vin Diesel. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2511.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2512.0s)]
*  Because they just get bored. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2513.0s)]
*  They could get any chick they want. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2515.0s)]
*  So it's like a new challenge. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2516.0s)]
*  Like it's like a power thing. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2518.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2519.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's part of it. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2520.0s)]
*  It's like once you get so much women's with the last thing you can, you know, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2521.0s)]
*  you trying to sneak into a dude's butt that don't want you, you know, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2526.0s)]
*  not to make it so, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2530.0s)]
*  but it's like what's the last thing on earth that I can't get some straight dude, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2531.0s)]
*  you know? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2536.0s)]
*  That's pretty weird. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2537.0s)]
*  I hope I don't get that successful then. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2539.0s)]
*  Or maybe I do. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2541.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2543.0s)]
*  It's like at a certain point. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2544.0s)]
*  That's what's at the top. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2546.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think it just happens. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2548.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, because you've had everything else, you know, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2549.0s)]
*  you kind of get to this other place, um, which all, which, with, uh, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2553.0s)]
*  the podcast with the full sin podcast, right? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2557.0s)]
*  You guys have had a decent amount of turnover on there. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2561.0s)]
*  Is that fair to say you think? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2563.0s)]
*  Was that hosts? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2564.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2565.0s)]
*  What has it been like? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2566.0s)]
*  Is it hard to keep hosts? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2567.0s)]
*  Is it that it's a challenging show? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2569.0s)]
*  Is it that I know you guys travel around a lot and so people need to be here [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2572.0s)]
*  and there? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2577.0s)]
*  What has been like, what has been some of the kind of journey with that? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2578.0s)]
*  I think at the beginning we were just kind of just having fun with it, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2582.0s)]
*  trying new people and stuff like that. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2586.0s)]
*  Obviously we had the one incident with Bob, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2588.0s)]
*  which like I kind of already talked about and shit like that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2590.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. I remember that. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2592.0s)]
*  Yeah. That kind of like, it is what it is, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2593.0s)]
*  but I think that was like our only real like big host change, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2595.0s)]
*  but we've subbed in like Salim or like Steve, like, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2599.0s)]
*  which we'll still continue to do. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2603.0s)]
*  And now we got Brad that is on it most of the time too. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2604.0s)]
*  So yeah, it is tough. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2607.0s)]
*  I think, I think we recorded like four episodes of the pod before we even [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2609.0s)]
*  released it because we just didn't know anything about it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2613.0s)]
*  Like we were just having fun with it. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2616.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2617.0s)]
*  And then we finally found one that we liked. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2618.0s)]
*  But yeah, it is, it's interesting. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2620.0s)]
*  The podcast is fun though. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2623.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2624.0s)]
*  Cause it's something that I could do no matter how old I get. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2625.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2627.0s)]
*  Right. And you get to meet so many fucking cool people. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2628.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2630.0s)]
*  Like Elon Trump, like. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2631.0s)]
*  Yeah. What was that? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2634.0s)]
*  Like when, when, when, um, once Elon sat down with you, were you, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2635.0s)]
*  do you find, is there a lead person who kind of takes the lead and breaks the [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2641.0s)]
*  ice? Do you kind of wait back? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2644.0s)]
*  It was, it was, I kind of took lead a bit on that one, but yeah, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2646.0s)]
*  it was a bit awkward at the beginning. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2649.0s)]
*  Cause I was like, you're kind of nervous too, right? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2653.0s)]
*  I'm not like some fucking TV show host or some shit too. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2654.0s)]
*  Like it's Elon Musk. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2657.0s)]
*  I'm, I'm pretty fucking nervous. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2658.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2660.0s)]
*  I use Twitter. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2661.0s)]
*  He, you know, it's like, I use the car. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2662.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2664.0s)]
*  It's like, I can't know how to get, I still can't know how to get into a Tesla. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2665.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2668.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2669.0s)]
*  I still can't. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2670.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2671.0s)]
*  Do you like Teslas or no? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2672.0s)]
*  I think once the truck comes out, if it ever does, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2673.0s)]
*  and that's the part that pisses me off the most is that he hasn't brought the [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2675.0s)]
*  truck out. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2678.0s)]
*  And I don't know why it's like, what the fuck's going on? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2679.0s)]
*  I just don't like Teslas. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2681.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2682.0s)]
*  Other cars, I think they just look kind of whatever. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2683.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2685.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2686.0s)]
*  They look kind of like a bat. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2687.0s)]
*  It looks like if you get in there, it's going to take you to meet some dude. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2691.0s)]
*  It's just, I just don't fuck with Teslas. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2692.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2694.0s)]
*  I guess the whole energy thing, but maybe I'm a scumbag. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2695.0s)]
*  I just don't give a shit. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2697.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2698.0s)]
*  I don't want to run out of battery on the road. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2699.0s)]
*  Like, you also don't want to tell you don't want to hike to somebody's house in [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2701.0s)]
*  the middle of the night. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2704.0s)]
*  Like my battery's down or whatever. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2705.0s)]
*  It's just not, it's not for me. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2706.0s)]
*  I'd rather just go to the gas station. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2707.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm fucking up the world, but it is what it is. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2709.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2712.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2713.0s)]
*  Sometimes I pour a little gas on the outside of my fucking car, dude. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2714.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not always a good guy. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2717.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2719.0s)]
*  Like I like the fucking smell of gas too. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2720.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2722.0s)]
*  If you sit in one of those old cars, it's like a Chevelle or Chevrolet or, you know, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2723.0s)]
*  Chevy and you fucking those ones that just, when you get in, it's like that. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2728.0s)]
*  And you always, you always hate, you always dread going to the gas station. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2732.0s)]
*  Like you're like, fuck, I got to get gas. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2736.0s)]
*  But then when you're actually there and you're filling it up, you're kind of [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2738.0s)]
*  chilling, it's kind of therapeutic. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2740.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2742.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2743.0s)]
*  I hate getting gas. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2744.0s)]
*  Like when I'm like, fuck, I got to get gas. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2745.0s)]
*  But then when you're there, you're like, this is kind of dope actually. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2747.0s)]
*  Like you're just chilling. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2750.0s)]
*  You know, it's nice. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2751.0s)]
*  And you, sometimes you feel like, oh, maybe I'll meet a chick here. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2752.0s)]
*  Never happens. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2754.0s)]
*  But sometimes there's like a chance it's always just some dude, like some dude who [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2755.0s)]
*  looks kind of like a mixed guy. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2759.0s)]
*  And he's, I feel like he's in like a cellar or something and he's fucking pissed or he's [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2761.0s)]
*  busy. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2767.0s)]
*  You know, or it's some angry Middle Eastern dude. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2768.0s)]
*  I'm like, how, how's every Middle Eastern dude angry? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2769.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2772.0s)]
*  Like, can we get like seven Middle Eastern dudes that are fucking pleased? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2773.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2777.0s)]
*  You can't fuck around with Middle Eastern people. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2778.0s)]
*  Dude, they're serious, man. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2781.0s)]
*  Cause I think they've been through like, they live in sand. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2782.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2787.0s)]
*  To live at the beach, but nowhere near the water is fucking- [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2788.0s)]
*  And it's not like Arizona sand or like- [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2793.0s)]
*  No. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2795.0s)]
*  It's like sand. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2796.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2797.0s)]
*  Like a lot of sand, right? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2798.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2799.0s)]
*  Some of it's quick sand, dude. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2800.0s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2801.0s)]
*  Some of it's like, Hey, guess what's in here? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2802.0s)]
*  More sand. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2805.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2806.0s)]
*  That'd be fucked. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2807.0s)]
*  Dude, that's like when- [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2808.0s)]
*  That might be the worst way to die. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2809.0s)]
*  Oh, oh yeah. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2811.0s)]
*  Would that be worse than drowning? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2812.0s)]
*  Do you make a video on the way out? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2814.0s)]
*  I don't think you have time. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2816.0s)]
*  I think you got a couple minutes. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2818.0s)]
*  How fast does quick sand do? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2819.0s)]
*  If we can look it up. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2824.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2825.0s)]
*  You're standing there in quicksand. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2826.0s)]
*  It starts to go. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2827.0s)]
*  And I think the suction kind of gets you pretty good. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2828.0s)]
*  So, and the more you move, the quicker it goes. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2831.0s)]
*  At least if you're drowning, you have a chance too, right? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2834.0s)]
*  Like you're fucking- [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2836.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2837.0s)]
*  You can get through it, but quicksand, you're just, you're fucked. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2838.0s)]
*  You got to make a video. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2840.0s)]
*  And then you have to throw your phone far so it doesn't go down with you. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2841.0s)]
*  You see one centimeter per second. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2847.0s)]
*  One centimeter per second. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2849.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2850.0s)]
*  That's pretty fast. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2851.0s)]
*  How tall is somebody? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2852.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2854.0s)]
*  I think that's irrelevant to that. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2855.0s)]
*  It's just like one per second. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2856.0s)]
*  It's kind of relevant. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2858.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2859.0s)]
*  It's pretty relevant. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2860.0s)]
*  Because then you see how many seconds you have. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2861.0s)]
*  But I think people are like, what, 180 centimeters? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2862.0s)]
*  So you got three minutes. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2864.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2866.0s)]
*  Bro, that's some time, bro. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2867.0s)]
*  We should try that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2871.0s)]
*  But like if there was no way to die, do you know what I mean? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2872.0s)]
*  That'd be like a cool challenge. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2875.0s)]
*  It'd be a cool game show. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2876.0s)]
*  Dude, I always wanted to make like this kind of weird kind of Japanese style game show [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2878.0s)]
*  where you get two guys to like, two like just real rural fellas, you know? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2881.0s)]
*  People that believe mostly in cum, you know? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2886.0s)]
*  And they just eat as much as they want, right? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2889.0s)]
*  For a couple days. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2892.0s)]
*  And then you sit them up each in like a tree. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2893.0s)]
*  And they both like defecate down like onto a scale, right? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2896.0s)]
*  And whoever does the most wins like something. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2900.0s)]
*  Whoever shits the most? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2903.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2904.0s)]
*  But you don't see any of the shit or anything. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2905.0s)]
*  It's like, it's all kind of hidden. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2907.0s)]
*  Maybe you see the shadow of it kind of. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2909.0s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2910.0s)]
*  And you have like a host. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2911.0s)]
*  So not like see-through tubes. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2912.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, nothing. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2913.0s)]
*  It's nothing that you just see the scale. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2914.0s)]
*  And that's what's really publicized. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2915.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2917.0s)]
*  You see the scale and there's like a host up there asking them a couple questions, you know. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2918.0s)]
*  What you got left, buddy? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2921.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2923.0s)]
*  Come on, Ronnie, you pussy. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2924.0s)]

*  I like that. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2926.0s)]
*  I just think that there, I think that that would be kind of a fascinating little game show [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2927.0s)]
*  because a lot of guys, they, you know, the best thing they can do is shit. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2930.0s)]
*  I feel like there's guys out there that they feel like that's what they fucking do. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2935.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2940.0s)]

*  Do you really? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2946.0s)]
*  I think like, I just get like a lot of good work done there and shit. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2947.0s)]
*  Like when you're sitting down to take a good shit. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2950.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2952.0s)]
*  Pull out the phone. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2953.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2954.0s)]
*  I'm kind of creative on the shitter too. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2955.0s)]
*  Like I'll think of ideas there and shit. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2956.0s)]
*  I feel like it's not a good shit unless your legs fall asleep. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2958.0s)]
*  Like right when you start to get that tingle, you're like, all right, it's time to wipe up. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2961.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's time to fucking tighten up. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2965.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2967.0s)]
*  Get back out in the world. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2968.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2969.0s)]
*  I remember, yeah, one time, Defa Kate and I was in Cancun and some girl, this was during Spring Break, came in and just did sex on me right there. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2970.0s)]
*  When you were shitting? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2982.0s)]
*  In the bathroom, yeah. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2983.0s)]
*  So that's like a bumpkin, no? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2984.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2986.0s)]
*  I don't know where she was from. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2987.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2988.0s)]
*  Or I don't know who she, I don't know her last name. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2989.0s)]
*  So you were on the shitter. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2990.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2991.0s)]
*  I was on. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2992.0s)]
*  And she started just like riding you or some shit? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2994.0s)]
*  It was a nightclub and I probably could have been doing drugs. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2995.0s)]
*  I don't remember, but yeah, I remember that. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=2998.0s)]
*  That's pretty awesome. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3002.0s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty legendary story. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3003.0s)]
*  It was a lot, man. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3005.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3006.0s)]
*  In the moment, it was probably kind of weird. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3007.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a lot because I felt like it was like a setup. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3009.0s)]
*  I'm like, nobody would do this, you know, so it feels like you're getting set up for something. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3012.0s)]
*  Damn, I got to do that. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3016.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3018.0s)]
*  But and also, I think there was the nightclub and there was like kind of, they had like too many smoke machines in there. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3019.0s)]
*  So there was like a lot of ambiance, you know? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3024.0s)]
*  But I remember that, man. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3027.0s)]
*  I forgot all about that, man. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3028.0s)]
*  Praise God. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3030.0s)]
*  That's pretty legendary though. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3031.0s)]
*  It was something, man. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3033.0s)]

*  We did, yeah. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3203.0s)]
*  So what was that kind of like? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3204.0s)]
*  It was pretty cool. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3206.0s)]
*  I mean, especially since I'm Canadian, I don't know how many Canadians have been on there. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3208.0s)]
*  It's kind of cool. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3211.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3212.0s)]
*  But it was cool. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3214.0s)]
*  I said before, I personally felt like the interior is a little outdated. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3216.0s)]
*  I feel like they could get an interior designer in there and shit. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3220.0s)]
*  It's big and shit. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3223.0s)]
*  It's massive. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3224.0s)]
*  But I feel like the interior designer maybe should be fired or something. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3225.0s)]
*  Does it look just more fancy? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3229.0s)]
*  Does it look like your dad's office? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3230.0s)]
*  Yeah, your dad's office type vibes and shit. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3233.0s)]
*  But it was really cool. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3236.0s)]
*  We were supposed to interview Trump that time. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3239.0s)]
*  This was right before the election too, like right before. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3241.0s)]
*  So people were hating him then. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3245.0s)]
*  Was this the first election or the second? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3247.0s)]
*  Yes, so people were hating him. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3248.0s)]
*  The second election? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3249.0s)]
*  First election. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3250.0s)]
*  Oh, first election. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3251.0s)]
*  Oh, no, sorry, second. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3252.0s)]
*  That's when people were really, really hating him. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3253.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3255.0s)]
*  Because at first he kind of represented this underdog type of thing. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3256.0s)]
*  Well, you think when he ran against Clinton, people didn't hate him as much? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3260.0s)]
*  I think people hated him more the second time. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3264.0s)]
*  Second time? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3266.0s)]
*  But the media also always hated him. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3267.0s)]
*  I think that somebody else would have done a little bit better in his position if they'd had a little... [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3269.0s)]
*  I don't know if he was the best speaker, but then also I don't know why we need the... [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3275.0s)]
*  Who, Trump's not the best speaker? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3280.0s)]
*  I mean, he's great, but I don't know if he connects to people that well. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3282.0s)]
*  I think he's a good speaker. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3286.0s)]
*  I just think he has a little too much baggage. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3287.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3289.0s)]
*  For the average person, right? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3290.0s)]
*  Yeah, but when he made it that far, I remember when he got elected, I was like, holy shit, dude, any of us could be president. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3292.0s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3300.0s)]
*  Like fucking... [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3301.0s)]
*  I don't know, no one thought he was going to win the first time. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3302.0s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3303.0s)]
*  Oh, when he first came out in the beginning, I was like, I think he's going to win. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3304.0s)]
*  We went with Dana, and then we were supposed to interview him, right? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3308.0s)]
*  So we thought we were going to interview him. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3312.0s)]
*  And then the last second they came in, they're like, yo, we're not doing it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3313.0s)]
*  And we're like, fuck. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3316.0s)]
*  They're like, yeah, Trump wants you guys to come into his office though, and he wants to meet you guys and shit. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3317.0s)]
*  And they're like, you can film it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3323.0s)]
*  So we go in and Trump's watching fucking Ted Cruz on the TV, and he's chirping him, making fun of him and shit. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3324.0s)]
*  And then they bring Trump on the TV, and he's like, look, guys, look, look. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3332.0s)]
*  Look how skinny I look there. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3336.0s)]
*  Look how skinny I look. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3337.0s)]
*  I was just like, no way. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3338.0s)]
*  He's exactly like TV in real life. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3339.0s)]
*  And then he's just like, oh, look at these handsome guys, such handsome guys, complimenting us and shit. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3341.0s)]
*  It was pretty crazy. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3346.0s)]
*  And then we went to his rally, and he pulled us up on stage for the fucking YMCA, the outro. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3348.0s)]
*  You know his getaway song? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3354.0s)]
*  He pulled us up on stage, and we ripped the YMCA with Trump. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3356.0s)]
*  And then he feed posted it on his Instagram. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3360.0s)]
*  And we were fucking hyped, bro. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3364.0s)]
*  Bro, he's never been to a YMCA in his life. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3366.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3369.0s)]
*  He loves it. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3370.0s)]
*  He says it's the gay national anthem, right? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3371.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3373.0s)]
*  But it's just crazy that he's never been. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3374.0s)]
*  There's no way that dude's been to a YMCA. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3375.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3377.0s)]
*  But when he posted that on his Instagram, we were like, holy fuck, bro. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3378.0s)]
*  Like we're shocked. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3382.0s)]

*  Why are you scared when you go there? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3484.0s)]
*  A little bit, because I know, like I grew up in a neighborhood where people are always [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3485.0s)]
*  knocking the, I mean, people's dads, like I remember the first day in our neighborhood, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3486.0s)]

*  I mean, people's dads, like I remember the first day in our neighborhood, this dude, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3494.0s)]
*  Milford was fighting this senior citizen, right? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3499.72s)]
*  In the street. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3502.2s)]
*  Mr. Polito was his name and he threw him into a fucking ditch fire. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3503.2s)]
*  Like into a fucking ditch fire. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3507.84s)]
*  What's that? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3510.04s)]
*  It's like, I mean, a fire in a ditch, but like, yeah, just a fire in a ditch. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3511.04s)]
*  And yeah, and he threw him right in that bitch, dude. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3515.92s)]
*  And then right here's the craziest part. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3519.36s)]
*  He fucking came out that bitch, dog. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3522.4s)]
*  On fire? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3524.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3525.76s)]
*  People were fucking cheering. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3526.76s)]
*  Did he stop, drop and roll or just go right back into the scrap? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3527.76s)]
*  He went straight at him, dude. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3529.76s)]
*  He was like 200% Italian. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3531.0s)]
*  He went straight fucking at him, bro. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3532.6s)]
*  I mean, and people were so excited. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3534.8s)]
*  People were just fucking and drinking Dr. Pepper fucking and losing their shit. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3536.64s)]
*  And I think he threw him back in, man. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3541.36s)]
*  But we just grew up in that environment where people were always fighting. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3546.04s)]
*  So you always knew that, you know, in order to get to another, a different part of our [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3548.6s)]
*  neighborhood, getting fight this one family, it was always like, you know, there were always [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3552.92s)]
*  trolls under the bridge, you know? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3557.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I think there's some of that energy with the, with UFC. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3559.6s)]
*  Why do you think someone's going to press you there? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3563.24s)]
*  Like jump out of the ring? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3565.0s)]
*  Well, the most, the people who are most enjoy pressing or being pressed are all in that [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3566.2799999999997s)]
*  building. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3571.24s)]
*  True. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3572.24s)]
*  And so I think it's just a risk factor and everybody in the fan is like an amateur, you [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3573.24s)]
*  know, in the parking lot at those events, it's just fucking people beating each other's [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3578.08s)]

*  It's kind of random, right? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3656.48s)]
*  Oh, it was the most random thing in the whole world. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3657.48s)]

*  They don't want to see what's going on. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3753.54s)]
*  I think they got it made over there. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=3755.14s)]

*  And it's only one person that does it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4285.78s)]
*  And like the managers are up there just fucking off, like munching on fries and shit. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4287.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4324.58s)]
*  Sometimes I wish I had more semen in my body than I do. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4325.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4328.58s)]
*  What was your experience? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4329.58s)]
*  I know you guys had OJ Simpson on, right? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4330.58s)]
*  Take me through the process of how you pull in somebody like that. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4333.58s)]
*  And was there some ethical questions? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4337.179999999999s)]
*  I know you guys don't have a lot of ethics. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4339.179999999999s)]
*  No, we don't have a lot of ethics. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4340.58s)]
*  But was there some ethical questions? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4342.58s)]
*  Yeah, you know what, actually, being real, we actually did debate it. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4344.58s)]
*  We've had the opportunity for like months. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4348.38s)]
*  Maybe like a year, honestly. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4351.22s)]
*  And I think he has a right-hand guy. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4353.22s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4355.820000000001s)]
*  For us, it's usually when the son's a fan. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4356.820000000001s)]
*  That's how we get mostly all our shit. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4358.820000000001s)]
*  If they have a male fan and he's 16 to whatever, 20-something, 28, he probably knows us, right? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4360.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4367.22s)]
*  So OJ's right-hand guy, his son is a fan. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4368.22s)]
*  And I met him at a Super Bowl party. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4371.620000000001s)]
*  We were already connected over email. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4375.22s)]
*  But yeah, we were talking about it. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4376.820000000001s)]
*  He's like, I can get OJ for you guys, blah, blah, blah. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4378.02s)]
*  But the only condition is like, don't bring up the trial. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4380.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4383.82s)]
*  And that was like, that was the condition from day one. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4384.42s)]
*  Don't bring up the trial. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4387.22s)]
*  Nothing about 1990, whatever. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4389.62s)]
*  And we're like, yeah, yeah, like whatever. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4392.22s)]
*  And then we were debating it. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4394.0199999999995s)]
*  Like a lot of people on our team didn't want to do it because we're like, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4395.22s)]
*  like we asked even like Gary Vee, I think, one time too. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4398.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, what do you think about this? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4400.82s)]
*  He's like, nah, don't do that. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4401.82s)]
*  Like, don't touch that. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4403.22s)]
*  And we're like, yeah. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4404.42s)]
*  So we were kind of scared of it too. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4406.0199999999995s)]
*  Because it is kind of fucked up. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4407.22s)]
*  Like, you know, how would the family feel? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4409.02s)]
*  Like, given that guy a platform to talk. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4411.42s)]
*  But I think the way we went about it was when we decided to do it, we're just like, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4413.820000000001s)]
*  yo, like we're just going to actually ask him, like the tough question too. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4417.42s)]
*  We're not just going to go there and not ask that. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4421.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4423.42s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4424.02s)]
*  You know, that's actually a really great point. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4425.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4427.22s)]
*  By asking him, at least there's that you're doing kind of what everybody wants to do. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4428.42s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's like, I mean, it's not our fault. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4433.820000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4437.02s)]
*  It's the just, I'm not the justice system. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4438.02s)]
*  Like, we let on, like we had him on and that's what a podcast is. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4440.22s)]
*  I would almost have almost anyone on. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4443.820000000001s)]
*  It's a good point. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4445.620000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I believe in the not giving someone a platform thing. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4446.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4450.22s)]
*  Personally. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4452.22s)]
*  I mean, we've had guys and, you know, guys that have had sex, you know, crime issues in our, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4452.820000000001s)]
*  you know, world. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4457.620000000001s)]
*  And it's like, when do you know if a guy's getting better or somebody or any type of thing? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4458.620000000001s)]
*  When do you know if a guy's getting better and try to help them just be a part of it? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4465.02s)]
*  You know, it's like be supportive. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4468.820000000001s)]
*  It's like if somebody were sick, you try to help them. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4470.02s)]
*  But with OJ, was it like, and I didn't mean you guys don't have any ethics. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4473.42s)]
*  I was just kind of kind of, but do you think when you saw him, was it hard to get that question out kind of? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4476.42s)]
*  It was so hard. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4483.42s)]
*  Because he walked in right away and like, you know, he's big or not. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4484.820000000001s)]

*  Comes in like he's talking about golf. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4493.62s)]
*  Like he's asking me where I play golf in Cali. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4495.62s)]
*  Like we play the same courses and shit. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4497.62s)]

*  I'll get the knife out. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4509.62s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, shut up. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4510.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4511.22s)]
*  And then we got into the pod and we're like, you know, again, he was, he's a very likable guy, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4511.82s)]
*  which is clearly how he, you know, he got, he did what he did. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4516.42s)]
*  Like he's very charming and likable. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4520.0199999999995s)]
*  So yeah, but for that one, I was just pounding Happy Dads. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4522.82s)]
*  I kind of treated it like a prank. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4526.0199999999995s)]
*  Like I was like, fuck, like I didn't want to do it, but I just like, I just kept pounding Happy Dads. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4527.62s)]
*  Will Happy Dads help someone ask a question they don't want to ask you think? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4532.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, alcohol. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4535.42s)]
*  It's liquid courage, right? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4536.82s)]
*  But Happy Dads specifically, you think? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4538.42s)]
*  Specifically, I mean, electrolytes and shit. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4539.82s)]
*  It doesn't help you ask a murderer if they did it. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4542.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4544.0199999999995s)]
*  It definitely doesn't hurt. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4545.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4546.62s)]
*  It could almost be like a thing that's capable of. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4547.62s)]
*  Not sure if your cousin killed somebody. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4550.219999999999s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4552.02s)]
*  Drink Happy Dad. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4553.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4554.02s)]
*  But yeah, no, it was tough to ask. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4555.02s)]
*  But yeah, I'm glad I did it. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4557.820000000001s)]
*  Because people were pissed. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4559.42s)]
*  And you did it in a way that was actually artful. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4560.42s)]
*  It was like, do you think, it wasn't like, do you think the murderer is still out there? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4561.42s)]
*  Are you... [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4563.620000000001s)]
*  I think I said, first I asked him if he's scared to face God. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4564.620000000001s)]
*  And then I said, yeah, like, do you think the killer is still out there? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4568.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because it's like, he's never really went out and looked for, have you ever even [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4572.820000000001s)]
*  looked for him? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4575.22s)]
*  Like even taking a walk? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4576.22s)]
*  But then after I read a lot of comments like... [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4577.620000000001s)]
*  He has bad hips though. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4579.620000000001s)]
*  He has conspiracies and shit that his son did it or some shit, but... [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4581.22s)]
*  The little fat son? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4584.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4585.42s)]
*  I mean, he's older now. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4586.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4587.42s)]
*  But apparently like his son was involved or something. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4588.42s)]
*  Bring up the son, OJ's son at time of murder. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4590.62s)]
*  This is going to be unreal. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4593.12s)]
*  This is why I still have to read it. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4595.22s)]
*  But have you seen that? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4596.86s)]
*  Before I watched like all the documentaries and shit and like, it was so bad. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4597.86s)]
*  Like there was like eight domestic violence calls, like pictures of Nicole like beaten [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4601.0599999999995s)]
*  up. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4606.42s)]
*  It's pretty sad, man. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4607.42s)]
*  Oh, this guy? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4608.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's his son now maybe. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4609.42s)]
*  No, it's an old photo. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4611.22s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4613.22s)]
*  But yeah, look at the group of the four of them right there. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4614.22s)]
*  You think that little kid did it? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4618.72s)]
*  No way. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4620.22s)]
*  Oh, what? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4621.22s)]
*  That kid, dude, he would have to run and put a knife forward. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4622.22s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4624.82s)]
*  Okay, I don't know how old he was, but... [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4625.82s)]
*  How much did that kid weigh, you think? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4626.82s)]
*  He would have had to like have a sword, huh? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4630.02s)]
*  I think it was just a regular knife. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4631.72s)]
*  Yeah, he definitely fucking did it. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4633.22s)]
*  I mean... [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4635.02s)]
*  Zoom in on that kid, Zach. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4636.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4640.02s)]
*  No, no chance. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4641.02s)]
*  Look at his face a little bit more. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4642.02s)]
*  Let's get a little closer on him. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4643.02s)]
*  I mean... [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4648.02s)]
*  No, no chance. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4649.02s)]
*  I think he's looking... [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4652.02s)]
*  He does actually does kind of look suspicious. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4653.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4655.02s)]
*  Like, oh, we'll see what happens next. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4657.02s)]
*  Yeah, he does look a little suspicious. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4659.02s)]
*  It's crazy, man. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4663.02s)]
*  I heard that girl who died in Colorado, her brother killed her. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4664.620000000001s)]
*  That famous little beauty parlor girl. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4670.42s)]
*  Jean-Bernier Ramsey? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4673.42s)]
*  Jean-Bernier Ramsey, yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4674.42s)]
*  That her brother killed her. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4676.42s)]
*  Damn. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4677.42s)]
*  And he's homoerotic, I think. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4678.42s)]
*  Did it end weird after you said that to him, after you talked about it? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4681.42s)]
*  Was there a weird energy? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4684.42s)]
*  I think he tried to keep his cool. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4685.42s)]
*  We also pulled up in a Ford Bronco. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4686.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4689.42s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4690.42s)]
*  We pulled up because it was just for the video. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4692.82s)]
*  We didn't want him to see us, but then he pulled up at the same time. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4694.82s)]
*  And he did a double look. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4697.82s)]
*  I thought we almost blew it right then and there. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4699.82s)]
*  Because he's like, what the fuck are they doing in a Bronco? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4702.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4705.82s)]
*  It's murder. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4706.82s)]
*  What if you were listening to that song you pulled out, dude? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4707.82s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was cool after. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4710.82s)]
*  He kept his cool. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4711.82s)]
*  I don't think he wanted... [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4712.82s)]
*  He's very aware, so I think he wanted to keep his cool and not give a good reaction. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4713.82s)]
*  Did you get a vibe that he had done it? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4717.82s)]
*  No. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4720.82s)]
*  Not really. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4722.219999999999s)]
*  It's hard to believe that he did. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4724.219999999999s)]
*  He's so likable and cool, right? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4726.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4729.219999999999s)]
*  It's hard to believe anyone would kill someone. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4730.219999999999s)]
*  You're sitting across from a murderer. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4732.219999999999s)]
*  You're like, did this guy actually kill someone? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4734.219999999999s)]
*  No matter who it is, I guess. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4736.219999999999s)]
*  But no, I didn't get that vibe. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4738.219999999999s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4741.219999999999s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4743.219999999999s)]
*  It's hard to know. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4744.219999999999s)]
*  We got some flack for doing him, but not that much. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4746.219999999999s)]
*  Most people liked it. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4749.219999999999s)]
*  But some people were like, why the fuck would you give him a platform and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4750.62s)]
*  But I don't really give a shit about that shit. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4753.62s)]
*  I think Ron Goldman's sister started a podcast, I believe, the man that got killed with her, with the wife. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4755.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4761.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4762.62s)]
*  The wife was beautiful. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4763.62s)]
*  With the wife of who? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4764.62s)]
*  With O.J.'s wife, Nicole Brown and her friend. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4765.62s)]
*  There was a guy, Ron Goldman, that got killed too. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4767.62s)]
*  That people forget about a lot. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4770.62s)]
*  And damn. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4772.62s)]
*  Crazy, bro. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4774.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I could do it, man. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4775.62s)]
*  I don't think I could kill... [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4777.62s)]
*  I think I could put the knife in somebody. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4779.0199999999995s)]
*  I couldn't pull it out. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4781.0199999999995s)]
*  Stabbing's kind of fucked. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4782.0199999999995s)]
*  I could probably pop someone with a gun. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4783.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but I think you've got to stab them if you're going to do it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4785.0199999999995s)]
*  You think? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4788.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's more like Rome. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4789.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like Caesar. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4790.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel like you have to at least do it. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4791.0199999999995s)]
*  You'll never even know what it's like. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4794.0199999999995s)]
*  At least if you're stabbing them, you're part of the culture. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4796.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel like even I'd lean more to a rear naked choke type shit. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4799.0199999999995s)]
*  Just choke them till the end? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4804.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel like I could do that. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4805.0199999999995s)]
*  The stabbing is just like... [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4807.42s)]
*  That's fucked. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4809.42s)]
*  You've got to mean it. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4810.42s)]
*  Yeah, you've got to really mean it. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4811.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4813.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you've got to mean it, man. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4814.42s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4816.42s)]
*  I think it would have to be... [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4817.42s)]
*  Even pushing them off a tall building. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4818.42s)]
*  That's insane, bro. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4822.42s)]
*  That's easier, though. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4824.42s)]
*  It's just kind of like a push and then you just cut. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4825.42s)]
*  But stabbing, you've got to commit to it the whole way. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4828.42s)]
*  It's like a longer moment. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4831.42s)]
*  They're going to look you in the eyes. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4833.42s)]
*  Maybe if you did like a... [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4835.82s)]
*  I mean you fucking pushed them. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4836.82s)]
*  I would do the fake cough at him. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4838.82s)]
*  I think you'd do something, you know? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4840.82s)]
*  Or just randomly put something there you're going to trip on. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4842.82s)]
*  Like, oh, that's crazy. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4844.82s)]
*  Why did somebody put this bowling ball right here? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4847.82s)]
*  Zach, did you get that audio working? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4852.82s)]
*  I just wanted to look at that. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4854.82s)]
*  Yeah, I got it here. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4855.82s)]
*  All right, thank you very much. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4856.82s)]
*  So you're talking about chat GBT, which for people who don't know, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4857.82s)]
*  that's the AI that makes stories out... [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4860.82s)]
*  It can make text stories out of anything. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4864.219999999999s)]
*  Text stories? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4867.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just showing you what the future of even class work and stuff could be like. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4868.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4873.219999999999s)]
*  How many of you know what chat GBT is? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4875.219999999999s)]
*  Not very many. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4881.219999999999s)]
*  So I'll tell you what chat GBT is just so you know. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4882.219999999999s)]
*  Because you need to know this. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4886.219999999999s)]
*  And I don't know what sort of technological revolution this is. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4888.219999999999s)]
*  Gutenberg Press level? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4891.219999999999s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4893.62s)]
*  So this AI system, it's a general language processing model, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4895.62s)]
*  was released about a week ago, a week and a half ago. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4900.62s)]
*  And I went and interacted with it. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4903.62s)]
*  It's an AI system, artificial intelligence system. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4906.62s)]
*  It basically is trained on a massive corpus of spoken and of text. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4909.62s)]
*  So it's derived its models of the world from the analysis of [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4918.62s)]
*  human speech, essentially. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4923.0199999999995s)]
*  It isn't using real world data yet. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4925.0199999999995s)]
*  But that will be happening certainly within the next year. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4928.0199999999995s)]
*  So, and chat GBT analyzes a very large corpus of text. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4933.0199999999995s)]
*  And that corpus is growing all the time. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4939.0199999999995s)]
*  Now it's already sophisticated enough. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4941.0199999999995s)]
*  I went onto it last week and I said, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4944.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, some of you know I've written these books, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4946.0199999999995s)]
*  12 rules for life and then beyond order, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4949.42s)]
*  12 more rules because you know, you can't have enough rules. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4952.42s)]
*  And I asked it, this is what I asked it to do. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4955.42s)]
*  I said, write me an essay that's a 13th rule for beyond order, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4958.42s)]
*  written in a style that combines the King James Bible with the Daute chain. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4964.42s)]
*  That's a pretty difficult, that's pretty difficult to pull off, you know. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4969.42s)]
*  Any one of those things is hard. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4975.42s)]
*  The intersection of all three, that's impossible. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4977.82s)]
*  Well, it wrote it in about three seconds, four pages long. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4980.82s)]
*  And it isn't obvious to me for better or worse that [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4984.82s)]
*  I would be able to tell that I didn't write it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4988.82s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4992.82s)]
*  And okay, that's pretty impressive. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4994.82s)]
*  Although, you know, maybe... [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4996.82s)]
*  That's crazy. I mean, just to think that like, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=4998.82s)]
*  you go put your information, you know. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5000.82s)]
*  The AI shit's crazy. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5003.82s)]
*  Okay, write this novel for me, write this story. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5006.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, it might not be great, but you'd have like, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5008.219999999999s)]
*  you'd almost have your ghostwriter right there create like half of the work. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5010.219999999999s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to like, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5013.219999999999s)]
*  be successful and make my money in the next like, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5015.219999999999s)]
*  five or whatever years before this shit becomes like mainstream. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5017.219999999999s)]
*  Right, because then at that point, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5021.219999999999s)]
*  there's not even going to be any value to being human anymore. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5023.219999999999s)]
*  No, like, and I feel like to compete in society, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5025.219999999999s)]
*  you're going to need to like, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5027.219999999999s)]
*  do this type of stuff or have like a neural link, right? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5029.219999999999s)]
*  That's the other thing too. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5031.219999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk, like, whatever in the brain. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5033.62s)]
*  Like, the most successful people are going to... [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5035.62s)]
*  They're going to do this shit. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5037.62s)]
*  I just don't want to be a part of that shit at all. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5039.62s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5041.62s)]
*  Nah, I don't want a neural link in my brain. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5043.62s)]
*  Would you get one? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5045.62s)]
*  I don't know, I think if it helped me sleep, I would probably get it. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5047.62s)]
*  True, I mean, the medical benefits are like, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5049.62s)]
*  that's pretty crazy. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5051.62s)]
*  If there are some, does it say there are? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5053.62s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of half of it, yeah, too. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5055.62s)]
*  I think he said like, it can like cure like, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5057.62s)]
*  Alzheimer's and stuff like that. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5059.62s)]
*  Paralyze? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5062.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, if that's true, that's insane. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5064.0199999999995s)]
*  But I think just the fact of everyone having [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5066.0199999999995s)]
*  like, something in their brain, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5068.0199999999995s)]
*  like, that's fucked. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5070.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, then the government has... [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5072.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5074.0199999999995s)]
*  They're in your brain. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5076.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, are they, like, that thing's probably downloading info. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5078.0199999999995s)]
*  But is it even the government anymore? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5080.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel like the government is like a shell LLC [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5082.0199999999995s)]
*  for like, whatever bigger, darker, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5084.0199999999995s)]
*  fucking money-licking lizards are out there, you know? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5086.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5088.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel like there's just some big lizard licking a nickel [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5090.42s)]
*  somewhere in a fucking bank vault. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5092.42s)]
*  What's that thing called? Reptilians or whatever? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5094.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah, people believe [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5096.42s)]
*  I think in some of that, like some, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5098.42s)]
*  you know, reptilian kings or whatever. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5100.42s)]
*  But it starts to feel like something's fucking going on. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5102.42s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5104.42s)]
*  Sometimes I think that, like, secretly, like, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5106.42s)]
*  aliens are like, running the world. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5108.42s)]
*  Like, I feel like they're on Earth, and they're like, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5110.42s)]
*  I don't know if they're disguised or whatever, but [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5112.42s)]
*  I just feel like humans are just so easily [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5114.42s)]

*  right? Like your shit people share it because it's funny. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5688.42s)]
*  Yeah. Like, you know, someone's going to be like, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5690.42s)]
*  yo, look, this is funny. Like, you gotta be [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5692.42s)]
*  shareable. Like, if you [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5694.42s)]
*  look at your piece of content and [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5696.42s)]
*  there's no reason to share it, you're not going to grow. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5698.42s)]
*  Especially now, it's not like before, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5700.42s)]
*  there's so many people doing it, like [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5702.42s)]
*  you gotta really stand out, right? Yeah. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5704.42s)]
*  You can't be boring. You gotta... [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5706.42s)]
*  Yeah, you have to find, I think, what [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5708.42s)]
*  is your unique thing. Yeah. And also [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5710.42s)]
*  editing can be key. So if you have a good editor or if you have [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5712.42s)]
*  a good eye for your own stuff. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5714.42s)]
*  Like, I remember when I first went to colleges, I didn't have a [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5716.42s)]
*  full hour of comedy, right? Right. So I [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5718.42s)]
*  would go and I would show up the day before [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5720.42s)]
*  and I would do, like, cribs [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5722.42s)]
*  like with, like, the principal of the school [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5724.42s)]
*  or like a fraternity house. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5726.42s)]
*  And then I would edit and I would interview people [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5728.42s)]
*  on campus and then I would edit it that night. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5730.42s)]
*  And so then the next day, I would [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5732.42s)]
*  do a little bit more and finish the editing. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5734.42s)]
*  And then, uh, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5736.42s)]
*  when it came time for the show time, I had, like, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5738.42s)]
*  this 20 minute intro video [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5740.42s)]
*  where it was, like, cut together like a shitty [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5742.42s)]
*  cribs kind of, but it was like the principal, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5744.42s)]
*  you know, or like the... That's jokes. And then, like, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5746.42s)]
*  fraternity... Is that shit still on YouTube? No, I never put [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5748.42s)]
*  any of that. I'll have to see if I can find some of that. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5750.42s)]
*  That sounds funny. It was pretty cool, but then I [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5752.42s)]
*  had, like, suddenly I had, like, a 20 minute opener [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5754.42s)]
*  and then I would do 25 minutes of comedy and now [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5756.42s)]
*  and then I'd do, like, 15 Q&A and now I have an [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5758.42s)]
*  hour show. 100%. But it was like, you, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5760.42s)]
*  I learned how to do, like, those things, you know, [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5762.42s)]
*  and, like, at least know what I was [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5764.42s)]
*  going to be kind of a domain [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5766.42s)]
*  over, you know, and how I like to [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5768.42s)]
*  navigate humor and clips. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5770.42s)]
*  And you could edit stuff together, too, to make things [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5772.42s)]
*  funny no matter what. Yeah. And now [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5774.42s)]
*  I think shit stopped going viral [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5776.42s)]
*  for a bit on YouTube. Like, remember when shit [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5778.42s)]
*  used to go crazy viral, like the fucking [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5780.42s)]
*  Charlie bit my finger? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5782.42s)]
*  Those type... No, but anyone could upload a video [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5784.42s)]
*  on YouTube. Cannibalism or whatever? Yeah, exactly. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5786.42s)]
*  People eating each other and shit, right? They [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5788.42s)]
*  would allow anything before. Well, they had one video of a guy [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5790.42s)]
*  making love to a dog in a park, dude, that was up [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5792.42s)]
*  forever. Action penetration? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5794.42s)]
*  Yeah, bro, it was crazy. That shit was out [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5796.42s)]
*  there, dude. That's lit. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5798.42s)]
*  It's crazy. Horse horn and shit. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5800.42s)]
*  Well, it makes you wonder if we'd ever get back to that, you know? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5802.42s)]
*  Where some guys are staying [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5804.42s)]
*  warm with the fucking St. Bernard. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5806.42s)]
*  And you respect it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5808.42s)]
*  Yeah. Getting a blowy from a [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5810.42s)]
*  Golden Retriever. I mean, that's a little crazy, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5812.42s)]
*  but I mean, that seems like... [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5814.42s)]
*  You know they're going to stay loyal, right? Golden Retrievers? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5816.42s)]
*  Dude, I remember the first time I saw a Golden Retriever, dude. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5818.42s)]
*  I'd never seen a dog inside someone's house [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5820.42s)]
*  before, right? So I'm over at [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5822.42s)]
*  my buddy's, dude, and this fucking dog [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5824.42s)]
*  comes around the corner, right? And I was like, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5826.42s)]
*  oh, I mean, it was... Just the beautiful golden? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5828.42s)]
*  Oh, just blonde hair, beautiful fucking blonde hair. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5830.42s)]
*  I mean, it looked like... It kind of looked like [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5834.42s)]
*  uh... [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5836.42s)]
*  Like Suzanne Summers. She was like this [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5838.42s)]
*  older model. Bring her up. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5840.42s)]
*  Look like Suzanne. I mean, it came around [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5842.42s)]
*  and it fucking looked like somebody like [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5844.42s)]
*  loved it or whatever. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5846.42s)]
*  And I just remember being like, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5848.42s)]
*  my god, dude. It looked like her. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5850.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5852.42s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5854.42s)]
*  But I'd never seen it. I'd never seen a dog [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5856.42s)]
*  indoors. Every dog I've been around was an outdoor dog. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5858.42s)]
*  You know? And they died out there. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5860.42s)]
*  I mean, they lived out there too. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5862.42s)]
*  Yeah. But... [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5864.42s)]
*  Dude, thanks so much for just coming in. Yeah, I appreciate it, bro. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5866.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really helpful for everybody to kind of [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5868.42s)]
*  learn about what the Nelk Boys [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5870.42s)]
*  is, what the Full Send is, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5872.42s)]

*  We'll get you to one for sure. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5886.42s)]
*  I'm supposed to hopefully start doing some stuff with UFC. I'm trying, so... [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5888.42s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I wanna try to start... [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5890.42s)]

*  Or like, you can't say. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5906.42s)]
*  That just gets me excited. I'd love to see you do that. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5908.42s)]
*  We're figuring out the involvement, you know? We're trying to figure out what it could be. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5910.42s)]
*  Because, god, I'm just so fucking... [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUt82uYCd8&t=5912.42s)]
