**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI)
*  Today's guest is a WWE Hall of Famer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a member of one of the greatest wrestling families of all time, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  the Von Erics. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=7.08s)]
*  You may have seen their family story told recently in The Iron Claw. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  He's an inspiration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=13.44s)]
*  He's a motivation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=14.92s)]
*  He's pretty funny. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=15.72s)]
*  And I just feel honored to be able to spend time with him today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=16.92s)]
*  Today's guest is Kevin Von Erick. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=23.48s)]
*  I'm feeling good. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=26.2s)]
*  I feel like I could throw this off. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=43.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=45.4s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=46.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=49.08s)]
*  So you get because you're always the barefoot guy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=51.72s)]
*  You were a barefoot guy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=53.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=55.44s)]
*  I sure was. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=57.72s)]
*  I always, I've got these really big toes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=58.48s)]
*  And once you stub your toe on the mat a few times, it gets bigger. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=61.8s)]
*  And so at first, I just took my boots off because it felt comfortable in the ring. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=64.8s)]
*  You know, just to move around better. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=69.08s)]
*  I felt like I could fly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=71.08s)]
*  But with the boots, they fill with sweat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Your socks absorb the sweat and all. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=78.24s)]
*  They get heavy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=80.6s)]
*  I had some knee surgeries too. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=81.28s)]
*  But I'll tell you, I go barefoot all the time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=83.92s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=85.72s)]
*  It's good for you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  It really is. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=87.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=88.72s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  I know you moved out to Kauai, was it, or Hawaii? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Kauai. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=92.36s)]
*  It's the new- [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  That's the barefoot capital of America. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  I'll bet it is. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  I'll bet it is. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=97.52s)]
*  We all go barefoot out there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=99.72s)]
*  I say I'm always kind of crazy about that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=100.88s)]
*  But I just hate for my toes to touch each other. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  You know, I was always like that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=107.12s)]
*  I hated shoes when I was a little kid. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  I guess I got old enough to say no, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  and I just didn't wear them anymore. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=112.84s)]
*  Did you ever wear those toe separator things? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=114.84s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=117.44s)]
*  Those are great. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=118.68s)]
*  You know, I wear them in the river at home, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=119.4s)]
*  you know, to walk in the river. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  But you can walk by a vine, and they'll cut your toe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=122.84s)]
*  You know, it can trip you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a little hazard for those things. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=128.72s)]
*  Did you feel like a caveman kind of? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=131.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=134.04s)]
*  The good kind of caveman. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=135.56s)]
*  I felt like, I mean, I'm going to drag around [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=136.96s)]
*  and pound by the hair, but I... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=139.64s)]
*  Yeah, no domestic disputes or anything. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=141.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, because like you feel the ground. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=142.72s)]
*  You feel the earth. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=144.72s)]
*  It's just something about it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=145.48s)]
*  I didn't know there was anything to it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=146.6s)]
*  But Ross tells me, my son Ross tells me, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=148.2s)]
*  that there's an energy in the earth [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  that your feet can pick that up, you know? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=154.04s)]
*  And I think I've been digging that for a long time [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  without even knowing it was a thing, you know? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=158.76s)]
*  But now I caveman it all the time out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=161.56s)]
*  Kawaii, that's the way to live. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=164.32s)]
*  Yeah, I bet it's, well, it's called, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  yeah, right here it says it's grounding. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=167.32s)]
*  Grounding, also known as earthing, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=168.72s)]
*  is a wellness practice that involves direct contact [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=170.2s)]
*  with the earth's surface, like walking barefoot on grass [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  or sand to potentially connect [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=174.96s)]
*  with the earth's natural electric charge. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=176.32s)]
*  I think it makes sense, because even if you look at a tree [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=178.64s)]
*  or a plant, you don't see them wearing shoes or nothing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=180.6s)]
*  Like that would be crazy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=183.92s)]
*  If you saw a plant, like wearing shoes, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=184.76s)]
*  you'd be like, oh, that guy's, that plant's out of his mind. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Like plants, you know what I'm saying? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=189.2s)]
*  They're connected to the earth. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=190.12s)]
*  So I think that makes good sense. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=191.12s)]
*  Oh, I see what you mean, yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=192.36s)]
*  Probably kept you pretty locked in. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=193.88s)]
*  Your family lives, you live on your family's ranch, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=196.52s)]
*  Or you live on a ranch here? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  We bought a ranch. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=201.88s)]
*  We sold it, we had, I lived on my family ranch in Texas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=202.72s)]
*  We sold it about 20 years ago and moved out to Kawaii [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=205.68s)]
*  and built a big place, you know, but we, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=208.84s)]
*  but I wanted to give my wife that kind of house, you know? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  So everything was in, it was in the house was something [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=214.84s)]
*  that I really liked about room service [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  or some hotel overseas, you know? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  I had a bathtub, you could do a cannonball in it, you know? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  Splash it all over the wall, it had a drain. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=225.2s)]
*  It was just, every room had something like that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=228.04s)]
*  But it was, it's real expensive in Kawaii [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=230.56s)]
*  and I have a lot of kids, you know? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=233.76s)]
*  And so they all go off to their house [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=235.2s)]
*  and no one wanted to live in the big house. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=238.72s)]
*  And so we happened to trade that to a guy [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=240.76s)]
*  that just happened to have 27 acres of waterfall on the land, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  a big nice spring and five houses, you know, for my sons. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  And so we traded that house for that 27 acres [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=253.12s)]
*  and that's where we are. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=257.04s)]
*  No way, just an even trade? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=258.04s)]
*  Even trade, yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=259.48s)]
*  Dang, you don't see a lot of that anymore. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=260.64s)]
*  No, no, I'm glad the guy, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=262.48s)]
*  I couldn't believe he did it really. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=264.68s)]
*  Did you have one of those open back of verandas [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=266.64s)]
*  or something that's called maybe in Hawaii? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=269.08s)]
*  What's that back patio? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=270.56s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=271.48s)]
*  Those porches and it's just so perfect. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=272.32s)]
*  Yeah, they call it a lanai. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=275.68s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  At my daughter's house there, when we stay with her, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=277.92s)]

*  I don't want to bum me out, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=343.36s)]
*  but my dad was living up in New York [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=344.4s)]
*  and we were all living up there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=346.52s)]
*  And I was the baby, but my brother, Jackie, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=348.0s)]
*  was like six years old. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=350.04s)]
*  And he would touch a house trailer with a, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=351.8s)]
*  it had a short in it and it killed him. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=354.32s)]
*  It electrocuted him, knocked him out [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=355.92s)]

*  He drowned under the ice, you know, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=361.48s)]
*  and broke my dad's heart. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=363.08s)]
*  My mother, you know, just killed him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=365.0s)]
*  You know, I can't imagine. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=367.28s)]
*  I have sons, you know, that I tell you, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=368.36s)]
*  I lost my brothers and that was hard, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=371.12s)]
*  but I could not lose a son. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=373.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=374.8s)]
*  I couldn't get up. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=375.64s)]
*  I couldn't stand on my hind legs, you know. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=376.48s)]
*  Did they have to go to therapy and stuff like that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  when that first happened to your old, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=380.8s)]
*  cause I guess that was your oldest brother. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=384.68s)]
*  Did they have therapy back then and stuff like that? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  Or what did you? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  No, no, there was no, they didn't. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=388.24s)]
*  My dad was like a rock though, you know, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=390.04s)]
*  I couldn't believe he was, he just, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=392.68s)]
*  he didn't want my mother to suffer [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=396.2s)]
*  so we wouldn't suffer around her. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=397.72s)]
*  But I'm sure my mother suffered so much. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  And also when she got married, her little brother, David, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=401.56s)]
*  died of a brain hemorrhage thing, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  what do you call it, a tumor, a brain tumor. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  And so just like a year later, her son dies too. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, it was just bang, bang, you know. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=416.56s)]
*  I mean, and at those times too, things, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=420.44000000000005s)]
*  I think there was more probably tragedy at those times. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, things were, you know, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=427.76s)]
*  you'd have a lot of people had a lot of children [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=428.76s)]
*  and a lot of them working farming [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  and people would get injured a lot. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=433.24s)]
*  There was just, I think it was a different time probably [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=434.52s)]
*  when it came to safety and stuff. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=436.92s)]
*  You know, and they'd have loose wires. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=438.76s)]
*  I mean, just things were just less regulated, you know. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=440.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=442.76s)]
*  It was, you know, the kind of stuff we did as kids, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  like, shoot, I can tell you a lot of times [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=445.44s)]

*  Oh God, I've been lit up a couple of times, damn. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=449.2s)]
*  I was walking by a damn crab restaurant [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=452.24s)]
*  and stepped on an outlet. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=455.2s)]
*  You did? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=456.92s)]

*  I don't know, probably 40 seconds maybe. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=468.52s)]
*  Wow, man. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=471.32s)]
*  Not long enough to give up, I guess. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=472.36s)]
*  You didn't have like a experience beyond the door. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=474.32s)]
*  I didn't get anything. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=477.48s)]

*  you know. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=482.72s)]
*  That might be a bad sign, brother. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=483.56s)]
*  That's true, actually. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=485.12s)]
*  If you start seeing the light, I'm like, nah, nah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=486.08000000000004s)]

*  It was like a brother thing, really. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=515.04s)]
*  And to tell the truth, the suicides and all, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=517.84s)]
*  that was not because Fritz made us wrestle [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=521.48s)]
*  or Fritz was a big monster or anything like that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=524.72s)]

*  stickler. But what was he like? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=652.5999999999999s)]

*  Was he quiet? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=655.52s)]
*  I mean, I guess he wasn't quiet because I could see like his wrestling persona. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=657.5999999999999s)]
*  But was his home persona like, well, I guess what was he like as a father? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=660.56s)]
*  And what was he like as a businessman? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=663.8399999999999s)]

*  And he would say it right then. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=685.52s)]
*  At night, you mean? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=687.84s)]
*  No, I mean, like whenever whenever he thought of it, it was just right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=688.84s)]
*  Man, perfect answer. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, but I mean, he was the president. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=695.24s)]
*  OK, you know that movie, the Iron Claw, where Fritz says, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=697.56s)]
*  the NWA always wanted to screw me, you know, kind of like. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=701.24s)]

*  And and he was the other wrestlers, I mean, world champions. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=708.28s)]
*  I mean, when my dad came in the room, I mean, they were like [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=713.48s)]
*  rolling on their backs like dogs. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=717.16s)]

*  and really do. And the way he stated himself, he didn't ever pop off. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=726.72s)]
*  He didn't ever brag. He always had the accurate thing to say. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=731.28s)]
*  Not too much emotion at all, just business. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=735.44s)]
*  And people respected that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=739.12s)]
*  I think in the wrestling business. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=740.48s)]
*  We have a lot of personalities, you know, the big egos. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=743.0400000000001s)]

*  Like, do you have a nice memory of them being together? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=773.6s)]
*  Like some like a moment that you remember that was that meant something to you? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=775.6s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=780.36s)]
*  One time I was in the den and my mom and dad were kind of whispering [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=784.12s)]
*  and they disappeared and my brothers were really young. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=788.96s)]
*  So they went into the little study there, I guess, to talk. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=791.56s)]
*  And and I thought they've been in there a long time. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  And so I took the little coat hanging, straighten it out, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=797.8s)]
*  you know, pushed it in the door and opened it up. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=800.64s)]
*  You know, they were at it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=804.04s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, man, I don't know. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=805.28s)]
*  The way I so as a little boy, I thought, why are they so mad? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=807.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know, why are they so mad about it? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=812.68s)]
*  You know, they're it sounds like they were having fun. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=814.36s)]
*  It sounded like two out of three falls. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=818.4s)]
*  Well, I just felt like I needed to go in there, you know, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=820.56s)]
*  and break this up, whatever it is, you know, and it was [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=823.9599999999999s)]

*  Break this up. You bring a whistle in there. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=830.4s)]
*  Yeah, right. She needs there. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=832.56s)]
*  That's really something you remember that. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=835.88s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=837.76s)]
*  I'm trying to think of that beautiful moment. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=839.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what came out. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=840.8s)]
*  So everybody was wrestling, huh? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=843.4s)]
*  Good. Wow. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=845.56s)]
*  Um, did you feel like you had to be a wrestler in your family? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=848.76s)]
*  Like, was it? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, the truth of it is, my dad didn't want us to wrestle, you know. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=855.48s)]
*  In fact, you know, he was so his finger was stuck, you know, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  and his hands didn't move right. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=864.0s)]
*  And, oh, yeah, he probably walked around like a damn crossing guard. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=866.24s)]
*  Oh, God, he was in his lower back and knees. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=868.5999999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, I actually said to my sons, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=872.36s)]
*  you know, you don't want to do this. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=874.84s)]
*  I promise you, you know, here we are in Hawaii and I can't even run on the beach. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  And I was a high hurler, you know, I used to high jump over my head, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=880.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, and I love to move. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=885.1600000000001s)]
*  But a day comes, you know, where you traded that traded that away, you know. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=887.72s)]
*  So I told my boys, you don't want this, you know, you really don't. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=891.72s)]
*  And but you can't tell them that, you know, they they were just like I was. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=894.9200000000001s)]
*  I wanted to do what my dad did. I thought it was great. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=899.96s)]

*  every everything he did was great, we thought. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=905.84s)]
*  And that's why I wanted to do like that. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=907.96s)]
*  I'm sure my sons are thinking the same stuff, you know. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=909.44s)]
*  Well, I think there's nothing more. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=914.12s)]
*  There's something inside of a son. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=916.0s)]

*  I remember he was a little boy. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1026.92s)]
*  He was so cute. But he said we went in the barn one day. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1028.08s)]
*  There's a big old wasp in there. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1031.6s)]
*  Red wasp, you know how they stuck the ceiling up there. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1033.6399999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, they're in the barn. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1037.28s)]
*  We're all alone. And so, so we, you know, those things that you should [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1039.28s)]
*  gift wraps, the long tubes, they come in the car. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1044.4s)]
*  Was present. Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1048.48s)]
*  So we lit one up security, hold it under those those those red ants. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1049.5200000000002s)]
*  But remember to hold your breath because they can't sting you [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1053.88s)]
*  for holding your breath. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1056.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, and so but so don't breathe. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1057.8000000000002s)]
*  And so we light it up and we're watching them go in there, you know, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1060.5600000000002s)]
*  and they drop all on him. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1064.16s)]
*  He runs out crying. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1066.2s)]
*  We said, stupid, we told you not to laugh, to breathe. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1067.44s)]
*  And he said, it's hard to hold your breath when you're crying. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1070.92s)]
*  So that is a great. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1073.96s)]
*  It is hard to hold your breath when you're crying. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1077.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he was right. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1079.5600000000002s)]
*  My favorite when we were kids, we used to pick on each other at dinner so bad. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1081.16s)]
*  And the best part was to get somebody to cry when they had a mouthful of food, right? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1084.92s)]
*  Because they couldn't swallow because they were crying so hard. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1089.16s)]
*  So the food just got it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1091.8000000000002s)]
*  We like it just got stuck in the mouth. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1093.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, just that shit was so having siblings was so much fun. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1096.44s)]
*  Did you guys do like Halloween and stuff together? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1101.36s)]
*  And like, did you all do that? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1103.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1104.84s)]
*  You mean go out and throw eggs at people and stuff? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1105.9199999999998s)]
*  And we did all that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1108.24s)]
*  And what was like birthday parties and stuff like at your house? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1113.44s)]
*  Because with so many kids, would you guys combine some of them or you? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1115.8s)]
*  Everybody got. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1118.52s)]
*  Well, we had a lot of boys, a lot of us in our house. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1119.04s)]
*  And I remember like ladies say, oh, it smells like boy in here. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1121.56s)]
*  And, you know, because we smell like boys, I guess. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  But but I do remember that it was really hard for me to get babysitters [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1130.36s)]
*  because like we would we're really hard on them, you know, just playing with them [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1135.04s)]
*  and stuff, you know, we'd kind of make a joke out of it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1140.0s)]
*  And they'd be crying and they're never going to watch these kids again. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  I was climbing the walls and stuff like that. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1146.6s)]
*  Oh, you need Abdulah the butcher to be your babysitter. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1149.3999999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm probably slow. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1151.8s)]
*  You need somebody big. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1153.8799999999999s)]
*  At that time in wrestling, were steroids like a popular thing? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1156.72s)]
*  Like I remember when I was in high school, we would people use like test 200. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1159.72s)]
*  But even growing up like in Texas, was it did people even know [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1163.2s)]
*  that steroids were bad for you or was it just like a medicine [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1166.0s)]
*  that was like kind of common in wrestling? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1168.92s)]
*  Do you feel like? Well, doctors would give it to you. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1170.84s)]
*  I mean, I didn't I had trouble gaining weight when I was like [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1175.1200000000001s)]
*  well, my whole life, I've had trouble gaining weight. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1179.64s)]
*  But and so I took Diana ball when I was in high school. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1182.28s)]
*  But I took one a day for like two weeks and then lay off for two weeks [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1187.0s)]
*  and then take it again for two weeks and lay off for two weeks. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1193.68s)]
*  And that's that was what kind of that was like of a little boy pill. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1196.04s)]
*  That's what that was for little boys that weren't getting puberty. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1200.36s)]
*  And then back then, like you say, there weren't all these rules and all. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1202.84s)]
*  Steroids weren't necessarily a dirty word. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1207.44s)]
*  But doctors did give them to people like after surgery and things like that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1210.08s)]
*  to improve their appetite and things. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1214.64s)]
*  And it makes a difference. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1216.96s)]
*  But if you don't lift weights, if you really have a strict regimen, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1218.0s)]
*  then it's just going to give you pimples on your back and make your hair fall out [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1222.24s)]
*  and your breath stink and all that stuff. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1226.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's yeah. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1228.16s)]
*  If you're not, yeah, if you're just shooting steroids and then just watching, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1230.64s)]
*  you know, I dream of Jeannie or shit like that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1233.96s)]
*  Yeah, your life's going to fall apart. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1237.52s)]
*  Yeah, like those guys that get the injections to make their muscles look big. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1239.56s)]
*  Can you believe it? Have you seen some of these guys with these? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1244.68s)]
*  They don't even work out. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1247.04s)]
*  They go and they get silicone injections for muscles. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1248.48s)]
*  You know, I got to tell you, Theo, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1251.3600000000001s)]
*  muscles are nothing, you know, it's all you want to know. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1254.72s)]
*  You're in wrestling. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1258.52s)]
*  I would lift weights because I wanted to be a better wrestler. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1260.8400000000001s)]
*  I want my kick out. I would push my man off. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1263.16s)]
*  I want to be able to bench, you know, a lot because it's important. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1265.16s)]
*  But I mean, it's [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1270.2s)]
*  to look pretty in the mirror. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1273.64s)]
*  I mean, that's just a few shades short of. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1275.28s)]
*  Yeah, fruity, if you ask me. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1278.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, look at this. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1280.44s)]
*  That's the stuff. That's what I'm talking about. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1282.24s)]
*  The hell is that? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1284.1200000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, the guy looks like he's stealing from Target. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1285.48s)]
*  What is that guy doing? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1292.16s)]
*  What is that guy doing? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1295.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that guy looks like a little. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1298.0s)]

*  Well, and I know sometimes it goes by age, right? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1693.12s)]
*  Because there's always a, I was the big brother, you know, and I [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1695.2399999999998s)]
*  have no doubt about that, but my brother Dave had a real responsibility streak. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1698.28s)]
*  He was just, my dad would come to him and say, okay, I want this fence to be, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1703.52s)]
*  I want it to go down there 200 yards and I want a good post or I want a double [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1707.0s)]
*  fence and I want, uh, and I want everything just right. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1710.88s)]
*  And he tells Dave. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1714.4s)]
*  And so David told me and Carrie what to do. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1715.72s)]
*  He's the foreman. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1717.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1718.68s)]
*  There's a foreman. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1719.08s)]
*  And so, and kind of working that way in wrestling too. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1719.96s)]
*  And, uh, he had, he was good on the microphone too. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1723.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1726.32s)]
*  It's important. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1726.8s)]
*  You gotta be good on the mic. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1727.32s)]
*  Was there a time where all, all of you guys were wrestling at the same time? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1728.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just briefly. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1733.84s)]
*  It was, man, that was so much fun too. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1735.56s)]
*  Cause we never got to go to Japan together. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1737.28s)]
*  Dave and I went to Japan together. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1739.28s)]
*  Carrie and I went to Japan. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1740.84s)]
*  Never together though. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1741.9199999999998s)]
*  But when we could all three to be together, just for the, when we first [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1743.6399999999999s)]
*  started out, you know, for that first year we could all three of us could go to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1747.1599999999999s)]
*  towns, we got so much fun, man. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1751.32s)]
*  We always would stop. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1753.56s)]
*  We'd scuba dive all the way there. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1754.76s)]
*  You know, if we, if there's clear water, if it's just a river or something, we'd [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1756.56s)]
*  dive in and swim. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1760.76s)]
*  It was just, uh, Oh, along the way? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1761.96s)]
*  Just, yeah. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1764.48s)]
*  We'd had fun all day and we wouldn't even go to the dressing room. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1765.32s)]
*  We'd get dressed out in the, in the woods where the swimming hole was. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1768.48s)]
*  And we could get our wrestling stuff on and go right to the show, get in the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1771.12s)]
*  ring, come back out into our stuff. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1774.0s)]
*  You know, we had it down. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1775.96s)]
*  We had fun. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1778.16s)]
*  And you got a leech in your tights, brother. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1779.24s)]
*  Hey, don't call it that. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1783.32s)]
*  Uh, were you all, did you all train together at home at a certain place? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1785.52s)]
*  Like, what was that kind of? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1789.32s)]
*  Yeah, we had a gym outside of the house and, uh, on an adjacent property. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1790.84s)]
*  And, uh, and I'm probably the cause of all the pressure because I, I would put [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1795.56s)]
*  up, uh, Vincent Barty posters all the time for myself, you know, I wanted to [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1801.4s)]
*  be the best I could be. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1806.44s)]
*  And that was what it was like to live in my own. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1807.68s)]
*  Back then it was like we lifted weights, uh, or three times a week, but we ran, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1809.72s)]
*  we swam, everything was about getting better because I wanted to play in the [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1815.56s)]
*  NFL and, uh, Carrie, uh, well, Carrie just wanted to wrestle, but, uh, and Dave [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1820.0s)]
*  wanted to wrestle, but I was, I was a football player and, uh, and so that's [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1828.32s)]
*  what it was all about is just do your best to quit or it's never quit. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1833.36s)]
*  Winners never quit. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1837.32s)]
*  Quitters never win. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1838.56s)]
*  You know, that kind of stuff on, I had posters everywhere on the gym and we'd [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1840.0s)]
*  spot each other and push each other and call each other sissies if we couldn't [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1843.44s)]
*  do it, you know, I mean, we would spit on each other, you know, we were savages [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1846.8400000000001s)]
*  and we wanted to get good as we could be. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1851.4s)]
*  And when we, we wrestled, it was hard. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1854.52s)]
*  You know, we, we, we were rough because we, anything worth doing is worth doing. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1857.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1863.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1863.76s)]
*  We wanted to be like successful moms. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  My dad was, but it would meant just go all out, you know, completely commit. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1865.64s)]
*  And that means every day on Wednesdays we were on five, 400 meter, uh, five, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1870.92s)]
*  one lap around tracks, 400 meter. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1876.8000000000002s)]
*  We'd run five, four hundreds on Wednesdays. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1879.68s)]
*  We time them and Carrie and I, uh, we're both high jumpers, Carrie high jump too. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1881.48s)]
*  And we, we could bench Carrie and I figured as long as we could bench [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1887.0400000000002s)]
*  twice our weight and high jump over our heads, then we would, we'll [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1890.88s)]
*  always be in shape and well, yeah, for knee surgeries and all, you can't do [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1894.84s)]
*  that again, but that was the theory we wanted to go with and Dave was the same. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1899.04s)]
*  Dave didn't work out in the gym as hard as we did, you know, but Carrie and I did. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1903.6799999999998s)]
*  Ever we, everything we did was too exhaustion and when we were kind of [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1907.6399999999999s)]
*  nauseated when you think about throw up, now you've done enough. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1911.6399999999999s)]
*  We really did, man. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1915.52s)]
*  It was all the way. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1916.56s)]
*  I quit way before that. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1918.24s)]
*  I realized. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1919.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1920.56s)]
*  Well, everybody does, man. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1921.72s)]
*  That's the, if you want to look different, you have to do it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1922.88s)]
*  Everybody else doesn't do, you know, and I mean, fight through that. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1925.0s)]
*  And did, were all of your brothers kind of subscribe to that same mentality or did [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1928.92s)]
*  some of them come along just because that, with that mentality, just because [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1932.2800000000002s)]
*  they were your brothers? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1936.0s)]
*  No. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1938.88s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1939.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1940.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1940.8400000000001s)]
*  I guess, yeah, nobody was just along for the ride. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1941.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1943.88s)]
*  I think they were all pretty much just wanting to be like me, Dave and Carrie [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1944.3200000000002s)]
*  wanted to be like dad, but you know, things got kind of different when we're in, when [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1948.3600000000001s)]
*  we're kids. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1952.64s)]
*  When I was in a junior in high school, sophomore high school, my mom and dad [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1954.4s)]
*  were going to get a divorce, you know, and my dad was going to move out. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1958.5600000000002s)]
*  That's what my freshman year was. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1963.92s)]
*  And I came into the kitchen one day, my mom and dad are talking and dad said, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1966.24s)]
*  Kev, I'm going to move to Dallas and just get an apartment and y'all are going to [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1972.16s)]
*  stay here and it's going to be just great. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1977.5600000000002s)]
*  Y'all go to school and come see me on the weekends. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1979.24s)]
*  And so y'all talking about a divorce. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1982.16s)]
*  And he said, hey, son, we were trying to describe it to you without saying, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1985.0400000000002s)]
*  yeah, I said, well, I want to go with you dad. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1988.92s)]
*  And Dave heard me and Carrie came and said, we do too dad. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1992.3600000000001s)]
*  We want to go with you. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1995.52s)]
*  And so my mom's going to be there alone. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1996.3200000000002s)]
*  It looks like, you know, and I guess they, but I was the mediator with that, you [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=1999.48s)]
*  know, and they kind of worked it out. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2003.5600000000002s)]
*  But with the deaths, you know, then my mother was kind of damaged inside. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2005.4s)]
*  It made her like she was suffering so much. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2011.76s)]
*  She, you know, with Dave, she was tough. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2015.16s)]
*  I mean, like her little, her own little brother and Jackie, but then with Dave, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2017.48s)]
*  she toughed it out, you know, but then baby Mike, he was the baby of our family. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2020.64s)]
*  You know, Chris was even younger, but Mike was the, we'd been traveling around [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2025.48s)]
*  and we weren't home that much. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2030.2s)]
*  So when Mike was the baby, you know, traveling with wrestling, you guys had [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2031.84s)]
*  been traveling with wrestling. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2035.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2036.16s)]
*  See, David, the movie doesn't have the soup, but David and Carrie were both [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2037.32s)]
*  married, you know, and Carrie had, Dave had a daughter, died a crib death, but Carrie [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2040.04s)]
*  had two daughters, and Holly and Lacey and their beautiful sweet daughters. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2046.56s)]
*  They spend every Christmas with us. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2052.36s)]
*  And we told you, we, I got the big house for all to have, all to have our [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2054.12s)]
*  Christmases and because family is just like we were saying, there's nothing more [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2058.64s)]
*  important than family to me after any thinking man. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2064.16s)]
*  And then again, there's the being wrestlers and our brothers. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2068.48s)]
*  I mean, my dad's a bad guy, you know, and they're booing him. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2072.48s)]
*  It kind of makes you feel like it's us against the world, you know, these people [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2076.0s)]
*  are booing my dad, if they hate him, then we hate them too. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2079.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2082.6s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2083.56s)]
*  So they, because at what point did they, did the, what the audience turned on your [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2084.84s)]
*  father or just part of the... [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2090.28s)]
*  No, he was like the perfect bad guy. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2092.12s)]
*  He was a Nazi. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2095.56s)]
*  And after my brother, Jackie died and they're up in New York, he was like, his [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2096.7999999999997s)]
*  wrestling changed, he was different. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2101.48s)]
*  He was a, he was wild inside. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2103.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think it was like, he wanted to just take it out on people and it showed in the [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2106.04s)]
*  ring, when people would, when the wrestlers would come to the, out of the [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2112.2s)]
*  dressing room, getting their cars, the fans would stand around and boo, you [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2115.88s)]
*  know, from a distance. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2119.6s)]
*  But when my dad came out, they get in his car, silence. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2120.84s)]
*  They were like, fear. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2124.6000000000004s)]
*  It was like fear. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2127.5600000000004s)]
*  He might run over here. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2128.48s)]
*  Oh, it was such an exciting time back then when wrestlers would come into the ring. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2132.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, there was just, God, I remember being a kid and we would lose our fucking [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2136.0800000000004s)]
*  minds and just beat the shit out of our sister. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2141.28s)]
*  The second the fucking wrestling program came on, we would beat the shit out of [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2143.52s)]
*  our sister for no fucking reason. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2148.2000000000003s)]
*  I guess she was, she just couldn't get used to the schedule. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2151.3999999999996s)]
*  No promise to stay away at that time of day or something. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2155.56s)]
*  Oh, if it was more than an hour broadcast, she knew she was in for it. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2159.16s)]
*  I'll tell you that. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2162.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, you hear a lot of stories about how wrestling was like, you know, we had to [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2164.44s)]
*  wrestle one night and then the next night you had to wrestle again. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2168.44s)]
*  And did you go on road trips like that where it was like a few days at a time? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2171.48s)]
*  Was it weeks and months? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2174.92s)]
*  I mean, what was it really like back then? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2176.04s)]
*  In 1984, I wrestled 386 times. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2178.16s)]
*  And that's, there are a lot, a lot of those were triple shots, double shots on, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2182.08s)]
*  on, on Sundays, you know, we'd rest TV shows or we'd do two or three times. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2185.8399999999997s)]
*  But after the started to be the deaths, you know, then I would have to, my, my [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2192.16s)]
*  dad had it work, Dave could sell out a building, Kerry could sell out a, I could [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2199.0s)]
*  sell out, but Mike was not quite there, you know? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2202.96s)]
*  And so when Dave died, either Kerry or me had to fill his slot, you know, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2206.44s)]
*  work another town and that was hard, but then Kerry with the foot now I've got [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2213.08s)]
*  two slots to fill, you know, and so I was wrestling three times a day, almost a [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2219.64s)]
*  couple of times a week, but I was wrestling every day. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2224.56s)]
*  Was it an option to take, take those, some of the slots off the schedule or did you [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2227.28s)]
*  guys feel like as a family, we have to fill this? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2231.92s)]
*  Did you feel like your dad was like, we have to fill this or it was just, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2234.52s)]
*  that's what you did. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2238.52s)]
*  Well, I got to tell you, we, you know, after the deaths, we were, uh, you were [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2240.3599999999997s)]
*  down, you know, and we sure didn't feel like getting back in that ring, but you [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2245.12s)]
*  know, you have to, because after death, there's all the publicity and dad's [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2249.08s)]
*  saying, you know, it's been a week, it's been two weeks or whatever. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2252.9599999999996s)]
*  But I mean, there were times when we said, dad, I can't do it yet. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2257.04s)]
*  Can't do it. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2259.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, but he did want us to get in that ring. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2260.9599999999996s)]
*  It was, but it was a family business. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2262.96s)]
*  I don't hold it against him. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2264.44s)]
*  I understand. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2265.56s)]
*  But, um, it was, uh, brutal to make yourself do that. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2267.28s)]
*  I mean, what's on your mind is a love and brotherhood and seeing them again in [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2274.04s)]
*  heaven, but you want to project, I'm going to kick that guy's ass. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2278.64s)]
*  You know, it's kind of your torn, you know, a lot of life's like that, huh? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2282.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2287.56s)]
*  It's like having two feelings at the same time. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2288.36s)]
*  It's like, especially with death, cause it's like somebody's gone, but they're [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2290.28s)]
*  the one that's gone, but you're the one that hurts and, and you don't even know [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2296.0s)]
*  what they're feeling like, and you almost don't want to like mourn too much because [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2301.0400000000004s)]
*  then it's like, are you just using the morning for yourself? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2306.8s)]
*  Does like all that kind of stuff has always hit me. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2309.0s)]
*  I know you wake up in the morning and there's nothing else. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2311.2000000000003s)]
*  You can't think about anything else, man. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2313.84s)]
*  I'm old enough. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2316.8s)]
*  I can tell you a little something. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2319.48s)]
*  Now I never wanted to endorse marijuana or put it over because, you know, I had a [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2320.7200000000003s)]
*  position, you know, what, when I woke, would wake up in the morning, I could not [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2326.2000000000003s)]
*  think of anything else. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2331.04s)]
*  That's all I thought about. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2332.1600000000003s)]
*  And if I smoked a joint, I could daydream. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2333.36s)]
*  I could think of something else, you know, and I, I had to, I was grateful for that [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2336.44s)]
*  stuff. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2341.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, it helped me. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2341.96s)]
*  Well, I'm sure, especially out in Kauai, it was probably, I was helping everybody. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2344.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, so I had my knee replaced, you know, and it didn't go very well. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2350.04s)]
*  It's kind of, I rehabbed it too quick. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2354.88s)]
*  See in college when you have a knee surgery, you, you fight like hell to get it back, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2357.32s)]
*  you know. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2361.6800000000003s)]
*  And well, I got out there and I got a knee replacement, but I'm a senior citizen. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2362.0800000000004s)]
*  And so instead of, I shouldn't have rehabbed it like that. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2367.36s)]
*  You know, I like, I was doing flips off the cliff with the boys and it knocked [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2370.12s)]
*  something, I smelled glue on my breath. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2375.44s)]
*  I thought, Oh, that can't be good. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2377.12s)]
*  Cause they just glue in there. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2378.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2380.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2380.92s)]
*  And you think some of it came up your bloodstream and you could taste it a little [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2381.24s)]
*  bit? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2383.4s)]
*  I tasted it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2383.56s)]
*  Yeah, I tasted it. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2384.48s)]
*  Anyway, so, um, damn, they're using damn glue. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2386.88s)]
*  Well, yeah, they do. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2389.64s)]
*  They use glue. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2391.96s)]
*  Well, shit, we could use glue. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2392.88s)]
*  I mean, I mean, they have the power tools really. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2394.64s)]
*  I mean, working on you, they got a drill. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2397.44s)]
*  The whole deal, you know, they hide it from you. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2400.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2402.12s)]

*  and they're doing damn woodwork on you in there. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2407.12s)]
*  Um, playing with with wrestling. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2410.0s)]
*  Did you have to be as tough at the wrestling part as you did at the partying [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2416.44s)]
*  part? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2420.44s)]
*  Like there seemed to be this thing when I, when I look back on like wrestling [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2420.7999999999997s)]
*  and a lot of the stories, um, especially coming up out of like the seventies, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2424.6s)]
*  eighties, nineties, where not only did you have to prove yourself in the ring, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2428.24s)]
*  that you were the toughest guy, that you were able to do the matches, but then [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2433.04s)]
*  you had to prove yourself again, like at the drinking table. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2436.4399999999996s)]
*  Was that part of the culture as much as? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh man, it was, that was the easy part for us because neither, none of us really [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2442.56s)]
*  liked taste of booze. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2447.12s)]
*  You know, we, uh, I mean, I, I, I'll have a drink or even two, but I'm done. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2448.4399999999996s)]
*  I can't drink six of anything, you know? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2453.64s)]
*  And, uh, I'm a lot of people can, but I think that was a big thing for us. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2455.8s)]
*  We never did get that big stomach. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2460.1600000000003s)]
*  I guess a lot of my friends, you know, love that beer. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2462.2000000000003s)]
*  All my teammates, you know, my wrestling colleagues love beer, but I never did [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2465.04s)]
*  get into it and I'm glad I didn't because it it's taken its toll on a lot of good [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2470.1600000000003s)]

*  sundown. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2487.56s)]

*  They had time release in them, you know, and it can work great. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2489.8s)]
*  It didn't make you goofy or anything, but I could ride a bike, you know, and stuff [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2492.96s)]
*  and I could, I could, it kind of hurt worse later, but with the pain pill, take [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2496.44s)]
*  another dang pill. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2501.88s)]

*  I feel like a damn care bear if I take one of them. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2503.44s)]
*  Well, then COVID came and I went to get my medicine because we never left our [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2507.12s)]

*  I grow four different types of avocado and we trade them with our neighbors. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2516.12s)]
*  We have, uh, uh, Turkey. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2520.64s)]
*  We raised sheep. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2523.04s)]
*  We have tilapia, fish full of thousands of fish and every kind of fruit you could [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2524.2400000000002s)]
*  think of, you know, it was, we had to have a reason to go. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2529.44s)]
*  The boys are spearing fish and throwing the net and catching crabs. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2531.7200000000003s)]
*  And so it was a great way to live, you know, so we just didn't really leave. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2535.4s)]
*  But, um, COVID came and, uh, so I go to get my medicine and it's like twice as [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2540.08s)]
*  much. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2546.08s)]
*  So I was already paying 900 bucks a month for it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2546.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like 1800. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2549.04s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm quitting this stuff. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2551.3599999999997s)]
*  And so, um, I quit, but man, I got these flu symptoms like, you know, I felt like [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  I was weird and, uh, but I fought through it, you know, but, uh, Ross got me the [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2558.96s)]
*  stuff called kratom. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2565.72s)]
*  It's a leaf on my tree. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2567.2799999999997s)]
*  And we could grow, we grow the tree out there. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2568.92s)]
*  You can crumble it up or it comes at you, put it in a powder, put it in a pill. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2571.4s)]
*  And I was able to kick that, uh, Oxycontin and 10 days, I wouldn't even want another [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2575.1600000000003s)]
*  one by using kratom. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2580.32s)]
*  You were able to create them, create them, did that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2581.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2583.28s)]
*  And then were you able to get off the kratom? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2583.6400000000003s)]
*  That was easy to quit kratom. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2585.48s)]
*  I never liked that stuff. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2587.0800000000004s)]
*  Smells like hay anyway, you know, but it was easy to get off of it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2588.04s)]
*  But, um, so, you know, I decided, I told you when it came on, I wanted my life to [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2591.2000000000003s)]
*  kind of be, help someone that's got all that suffering, you want to get something [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2597.88s)]
*  good, you know, and, uh, and if anyone is suffering from any kind of addiction, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2602.6400000000003s)]
*  like the opioids and all, bear that in mind, they're creating places all around. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2608.76s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm not getting any money for it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2612.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm just saying it sure helped me. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2614.44s)]
*  And if you're an addict and it was bothering you, I mean, I, I could, I [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2616.2400000000002s)]
*  couldn't believe I was addicted to this stuff. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2620.28s)]
*  I mean, I wanted to quit and I got sick. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2622.52s)]
*  I thought, shit, never going to let something happen like this to me again. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2625.04s)]
*  How bad did the octid did it did octi like feeling like you had to take OxyCons get? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2628.52s)]
*  Well, um, I never kind of let it get to that point. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2634.04s)]
*  You're supposed to take it at one o'clock, supposed to take it in the morning, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2637.08s)]
*  10 night before you go to bed. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2639.44s)]
*  And so that's what it always did. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2640.4s)]
*  And you don't walk around high. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2642.04s)]
*  You just don't hurt, you know, cause it's got the pain relief, the time [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2643.6s)]
*  release in it, you know, but. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2647.36s)]
*  But that kratom was helpful, huh? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2649.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2650.64s)]

*  I have a friend who got addicted to kratom. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2652.2s)]
*  Um, so I think there's probably, there can be a slope there, but I certainly [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2655.16s)]
*  could see how it could be used to help people get off of OxyCons. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2658.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2662.12s)]
*  It's illegal in some countries. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2662.48s)]
*  Kratom is? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2664.24s)]
*  Kratom is. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2664.8s)]
*  It must be a legal, uh, addictive. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2665.44s)]

*  It runs in my family. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2674.44s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't think it does. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2675.36s)]
*  My brother, Kerry, you know, was, uh, he went to the Betty Ford Clinic and all [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2678.04s)]

*  He just liked all of it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2688.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, he'd do cocaine one day. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2689.56s)]
*  He'd do pain pills the next day. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2691.04s)]
*  He'd do acid. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2692.56s)]
*  Mushrooms. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2695.32s)]

*  addiction problems, like if they had looked at it by today's standards. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2726.32s)]

*  I think, you know, when you're big in a bodybuilding, a lot of those things kind [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2936.76s)]
*  of come along, like, you know, there's different creatines, there's different [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2940.0s)]
*  uppers, there's like these testosterone, revigorators or whatever. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2943.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's a picture of like, it comes up, sometimes it comes in like a huge set of [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2948.28s)]
*  balls of the powder or whatever. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2951.2400000000002s)]
*  Like what the hell is this? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2953.36s)]
*  But yeah, there's all types of that, that bodybuilding has always been on the edge [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2954.6400000000003s)]
*  of the, of like, so competitive using us and finding an, uh, an advantage. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2959.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2965.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, that's so, that's so, when two guys are going to look at, looking at the [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2965.6800000000003s)]
*  mirror with each other and I got better things to do. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2970.2s)]
*  At a certain point, I think so. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2975.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, it's interesting that you refer to other wrestlers as like a team or you [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2977.92s)]
*  were referred as your team or something. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2981.6s)]
*  Um, is that how you guys thought of y'all's wrestling organization as a team? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2983.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was a family business and it was like a team. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2989.12s)]
*  It was like, uh, if you know, we were never, we're jealous of each other, you [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2992.2s)]
*  know, as to the real truth to it is, you know, uh, when my dad and I flipped, when [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=2996.8s)]
*  Kerry and me flipped the coin for the world title, well, the truth to it was [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3003.1200000000003s)]
*  that I said, I've had a family and I'm married and I have children, you know, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3008.1200000000003s)]
*  and Kerry wanted to be the world champion, but to be the world champion is a special [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3011.76s)]
*  kind of wrestler to do that. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3017.76s)]
*  And not a Kerry, you need somebody that makes the other guy look good. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3019.4s)]
*  That's really what it's all about. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3024.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, and, uh, and, uh, Dave could have done that, but, and I think Kerry [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3026.08s)]
*  may, I couldn't have done it though. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3032.0s)]
*  I've been a baby face my whole life. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3033.32s)]

*  real, uh, difficult work in wrestling, the hard stuff is to be healed. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3040.4s)]
*  That's the creative stuff, you know, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3044.8s)]

*  He would fight to the death, but he had a heart for little kids and for girls. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3139.6800000000003s)]
*  And he was just nice. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3145.8s)]
*  He was such a good guy, man. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3147.1600000000003s)]
*  But he was a battleship too. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3149.2000000000003s)]
*  What, um, did he pass away? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3151.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3153.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3153.88s)]
*  What happened to him? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3154.36s)]
*  Oh shoot. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3155.76s)]
*  He was, uh, he overdid it on the plane. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3157.04s)]
*  He OD'd on a plane and they had to restart him. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3162.04s)]
*  Shoot. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3166.08s)]
*  And then something, I believe that his blood was stayed away from his brain too [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3167.84s)]
*  long and it starved his brain. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3173.4s)]
*  And he had some damage when he, when he came out of that, then I talked to him [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3174.6800000000003s)]
*  and he just, Kev, uh, hurt myself, brother. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3179.2000000000003s)]
*  I said, no, Terry, you're fine. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3183.36s)]
*  He goes, no, I'm not fine, Kev. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3184.7200000000003s)]
*  So he had, he could talk to me, but he was real slow. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3187.36s)]
*  He didn't have any of this hand to eye kind of coordination. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3191.08s)]
*  So it cost him something, huh? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3196.8s)]
*  Dang. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3198.36s)]
*  But then I'd always heard that he fell off the jetway, getting on a plane one time too. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3199.0s)]
*  I think you did. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3203.52s)]
*  He fell off the jetway, drunk, landed on his head and got back up and [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3204.64s)]
*  got on the plane and made the show. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3209.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3211.36s)]
*  But so I thought that was why he was like that, but he said, no, something else. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3211.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3218.12s)]
*  So many guys went through so much, man. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3220.04s)]
*  Terry Funk, he's, he's still alive, I believe, isn't he? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3223.2s)]
*  Man, I hope so, but I hadn't heard the bad news. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3226.28s)]
*  If he had, I know he says he passed away in August. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3229.76s)]
*  I love that guy and Dory too. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3233.1600000000003s)]
*  So I hope that Terry Funk was, man, he was incredible to watch. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3234.96s)]
*  Wasn't he? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3240.28s)]
*  He sure was. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3241.2400000000002s)]
*  He taught me so much to me, my brother, Dave and I were 19, 18 years old. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3242.5600000000004s)]
*  And we're the bad guys and Amarillo wrestling, Dory and Terry, who [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3249.2400000000002s)]
*  are the great good guys, you know, they loved them. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3253.04s)]
*  And Dory Funk as well? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3255.6000000000004s)]
*  And Dory, their brothers and their dad was Dory Funk senior. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3257.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3261.1200000000003s)]
*  A super bad ass. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3261.76s)]
*  Well, these two were in the ring and Dave and I were just learning, you [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3264.1600000000003s)]
*  know, we're just learning about this. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3268.0400000000004s)]
*  Dave pretty good, he go, but I didn't know what to do really. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3269.32s)]
*  And so we're in the ring and, and Dory's telling us everything. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3273.32s)]
*  He goes, spit on me kid. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3277.84s)]
*  I said, sir. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3279.76s)]
*  He said, spit on me. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3281.0800000000004s)]
*  So I spit on him. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3283.16s)]
*  So Dave unloads on Terry too. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3285.72s)]
*  The crowd went wild. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3288.9199999999996s)]
*  They hated our guts. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3290.3999999999996s)]
*  So they beat us, you know, when I get on the mic and I say, you're in trouble. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3291.64s)]
*  Now I'm going to get my daddy. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3295.3599999999997s)]
*  And so then they food me good, you know? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3297.08s)]
*  And so I love being a heel, but I just wasn't good at like, you know, like Dave was. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3300.04s)]
*  Irving Curry. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3305.8799999999997s)]
*  So that was the real, so that, so that was something that was tough to be a heel. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3306.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3310.92s)]
*  It's a lot harder. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3311.32s)]
*  You have to have some creativity about it, you know? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3312.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3314.88s)]
*  And then you've got to have a personality that we're, I mean, that, that, that, that [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3315.44s)]
*  you're projecting, it's got to come from in here, you know? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3320.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3323.36s)]
*  And you can't get upset if people don't like you because you're almost the [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3323.8s)]
*  guy that people don't like. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3326.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, Dave and I are coming back from the ring in Florida one time in this [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3328.36s)]
*  cow and Dave's a bad guy and so I'm a heel too. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3331.0400000000004s)]
*  And so this guy steps up, you remember people would dip skull and they spit in [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3334.1600000000003s)]
*  those cups. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3337.4s)]
*  So we sloshed that stuff on us, you know, and I thought, well, you know, we've [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3338.36s)]
*  been making, we've been begging them to hate our guts. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3343.76s)]
*  Finally we're there and I look and Dave's running up in the bleachers after the [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3346.28s)]
*  guy kicked us out. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3349.92s)]
*  So, you know, but so I said, Dave, we worked our butts off to make him hate us. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3352.8s)]
*  He goes, Dave was just, you know, you couldn't talk to him. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3358.44s)]
*  He was so mad. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3361.76s)]
*  Here's a dirty little secret. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3362.56s)]
*  The insurance company would rather keep under wraps insurance companies profit [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3363.88s)]
*  by holding onto money for as long as possible. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3369.4s)]
*  So after the accident, they'll do whatever they can to delay or deny your [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3372.92s)]
*  claim this way they can keep those profits growing Morgan and Morgan fights [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3377.24s)]
*  hard for their clients and these corporate bullies know that a recent [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3382.2s)]
*  client in Pennsylvania just received $29 million and they're going to be [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3386.52s)]

*  Best offer was 500,000. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3393.2s)]
*  Another recent client in Florida received $20 million. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3396.4399999999996s)]
*  Last offer was $0. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3400.0s)]

*  And I sound like I'm exaggerating, but he carried the ball five times and he [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3541.32s)]
*  scored five touchdowns. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3546.6400000000003s)]
*  And the coach took him off offense, just said he wanted to save him for defense, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3548.48s)]
*  but he was great on offense. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3552.1600000000003s)]
*  He was a good linebacker too, but, but he was really a good running back. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3553.6400000000003s)]
*  I've never seen anybody just run through people like that, but he didn't like [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3557.72s)]
*  football. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3561.9199999999996s)]
*  The Texas, University of Texas offered him a scholarship. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3562.48s)]
*  He didn't want to go. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3564.9599999999996s)]
*  He didn't want to play football. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3566.3599999999997s)]
*  He wanted to do track. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3567.3999999999996s)]
*  No, he wanted to do track. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3568.9199999999996s)]
*  He wanted to do track. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3569.8399999999997s)]
*  And Dave, the same way basketball. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3570.4399999999996s)]
*  Dave loved basketball. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3572.3999999999996s)]
*  I love football, you know, but we go to North Texas and Dave has his scholarship. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3573.68s)]
*  We're both there, you know, and, and so I look up on that hill one day and it's a [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3581.3199999999997s)]
*  real hot day and I hear a pop and I suddenly hits the ground. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3587.12s)]
*  And so I look up there and I can see through the dust. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3591.24s)]
*  There's big old frame getting up off of that ground. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3594.2s)]
*  He's playing wide receiver and we had some defensive backs were killers, you [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3596.6s)]
*  know, and, and so, uh, Dave gets up and I see the coach is parked over there [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3600.52s)]
*  watching practice and he walks out to Dave and he tells Dave we're practicing [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3605.7999999999997s)]
*  in that air conditioned gym out there. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3611.3599999999997s)]
*  And when we get thirsty, we get a drink of water. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3613.64s)]
*  It's not like this out here. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3616.3599999999997s)]
*  And so Dave quit and went to play basketball at North Texas and I played [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3617.7599999999998s)]
*  football, but that we all each are sports. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3621.3199999999997s)]
*  Dave was a basketball player. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3624.3199999999997s)]
*  I ran, I played football, McCurry was just, you know, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3625.52s)]
*  and your other brothers, Mike and Chris, were you guys a little bit [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3630.0s)]
*  disconnected for them because of age or? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3632.48s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3634.04s)]
*  Because by then we were wrestling and we weren't home very much. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3635.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3638.24s)]
*  Mike was the big brother to Chris. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3638.4399999999996s)]
*  Got it. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3640.52s)]
*  So that was almost like a second. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3641.64s)]
*  It was almost like a second installment of children in a way. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3642.8s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3647.5600000000004s)]
*  Um, yeah, I saw that match with Carrie and Rick flair or there's one [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3648.5600000000004s)]
*  way I remember it was during the daytime, right? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3652.32s)]
*  And I think it was an 84 maybe. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3655.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3658.2000000000003s)]
*  Is it daytime? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3659.32s)]
*  It was 84. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3660.7200000000003s)]
*  This was after David had passed away. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3661.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3663.52s)]
*  Um, were you at this match? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3664.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3666.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh, I wrestle on this card too. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3667.32s)]
*  Cause he looks so much more athletic and no judgment to Rick flair. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3670.0s)]
*  I mean, their age difference is maybe huge here, but did he ever have to [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3674.7599999999998s)]
*  slow down with other wrestlers to make it look more real? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3677.8s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3681.16s)]
*  Well, I suppose, but yeah, you know, it's all about, uh, it's, he had such [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3682.88s)]
*  charisma, you know, that his charisma was really his thing. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3690.4s)]
*  I mean, he had a great body and a beautiful build. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3693.96s)]
*  And I'm gonna tell you, uh, Tony Atlas and I were bench pressing and, uh, I [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3696.04s)]
*  had a good bench press, I can bench 445 pounds, but my brother and Tony were [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3701.4s)]
*  benching 520, both of them. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3706.2400000000002s)]
*  And I mean, repping it, you know, and I've never seen anybody as strong as [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3708.52s)]
*  Carrie was, I mean, Carrie for his size had the most power I've ever [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3712.4s)]
*  and you see somebody be able to bring up. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3717.84s)]
*  And he was agile too. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3722.0s)]
*  I told you, you could high jumper, really good high jumper. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3724.32s)]
*  What was it like when flair came to town? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3726.56s)]
*  That must've been a ride, huh? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3728.88s)]
*  He's quite a character. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3730.04s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3731.2400000000002s)]
*  He's something else. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3732.88s)]
*  He's something else, man. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3733.7200000000003s)]
*  You got a show with him, right? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3735.4s)]
*  And the best time, cause he's just, he's got stories and he let, you know, he [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3736.76s)]
*  likes to, you know, it's fun. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3741.36s)]
*  He's all fun all the time. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3743.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3745.16s)]
*  And it's no other side to it really. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3745.64s)]
*  No, it kind of isn't. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3747.4s)]
*  He is a real gentleman. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3749.08s)]
*  He's got a great voice. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3751.64s)]
*  Well, you know, when you hear his voice, you think that should be a radio man. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3752.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, he really does sound good, but, but when he comes to your town, he's [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3756.3199999999997s)]
*  going to give an interview and that's going to rile out of care who you are. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3761.08s)]
*  He's going to make you furious and you're going to come down and see him [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3764.56s)]
*  get his butt kicked. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3766.72s)]
*  And so that's, you gotta have that, you know, that's that that's Rick. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3768.2s)]
*  Now Harley, Harley race and, and the other champions, the, the, drawing a [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3772.16s)]
*  plank, but I mean the, the briscoes and they were great, but he said something [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3780.2799999999997s)]
*  else they brought to the table. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3786.3999999999996s)]
*  Harley was, you know, he has his rep at all of his different holes and moves. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3788.08s)]
*  And, but Rick, what an interview he gives and he's got the experience too. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3791.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, he's something else and he's got a good head for, for when to do what [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3795.7999999999997s)]
*  he does, but you see what I mean? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3799.52s)]
*  That was a guy like me really, really wouldn't fit the bill like Rick would. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3801.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3806.2s)]
*  Cause he's going to, and he's going to bump all night. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3806.4799999999996s)]
*  He doesn't ever get tired. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3808.08s)]
*  You know, he's the, he's going to have, he's going to drag it out to an hour. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3809.28s)]
*  Or try to. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3812.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3814.44s)]
*  Just magnetic, man. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3814.6800000000003s)]
*  That was a magnetic time. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3815.96s)]
*  He is. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3817.4s)]
*  Um, what was one of the most traumatic things that happened to one of your [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3818.0s)]
*  brothers in their life while they were alive? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3821.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, was there anything that kind of started changed their life a little bit [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3824.8s)]
*  that we didn't really see as much? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3830.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, probably so. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3833.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3834.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, my little brother, Mike, you know, with the toxic shock syndrome, he [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3834.6400000000003s)]
*  had, we were resting in Tel Aviv and, uh, we're going to do some shows in Lebanon [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3838.96s)]
*  too. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3844.32s)]
*  And so Mike saw wrestling the guy, but his shoulder had been, uh, dislocated [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3845.12s)]
*  and he'd popped it back in the dress room, got back out there in the ring and [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3851.48s)]
*  it popped out again and it had really popped out bad this time. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3854.88s)]
*  So, uh, we flew him back to Texas to get surgery and with the incision, he got, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3859.08s)]
*  uh, toxic shocks in him. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3867.88s)]
*  It's a tampon thing, ladies get, but they had such a huge incision where the arm [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3869.5600000000004s)]
*  was or the shoulder was that they had chef gauze in there. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3876.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, and some of it had gotten left in. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3880.96s)]
*  I think that might, it didn't get left in, but it got septic or something, maybe. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3882.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, but whatever it was, his fever went up to so high, 106, 100. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3887.0s)]
*  I even heard 107, but that, it didn't kill him though. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3892.32s)]
*  In fact, the doctor came down, I say team, you wouldn't believe it though. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3896.72s)]
*  The hospital was filled with fans. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3902.08s)]
*  You know, they wanted to offer their kidneys or their liver to Mike, you know, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3905.7999999999997s)]
*  to such a love, you know, but, um, the docs told us that he's just, his fever [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3909.48s)]
*  is too high. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3915.52s)]
*  He's not, he's not going to come back and he's, he's not going to make it [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3916.16s)]
*  through the night. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3920.0s)]
*  And so rather than go up there and say good night, like you told him to, like [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3921.2799999999997s)]
*  you told us to, then we had, uh, my parents were down in this waiting room at [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3924.8s)]
*  the hospital up here at Baylor and we had, uh, Gary Holder was, we had a [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3929.88s)]
*  chaplain that would go with our, just shows, you know, big shows. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3935.52s)]
*  And he gave us a prayer where he talked about, he said, God, you say anything we [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3940.04s)]
*  ask in Jesus' name, then you will do it. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3945.52s)]
*  So we're asking you to stand on your word. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3948.92s)]
*  And he slammed that Bible down on the desk. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3951.6000000000004s)]
*  Man, I wanted to hide my head. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3954.92s)]
*  I thought he went too far, you know, but it was just a few seconds later, the door [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3957.04s)]
*  opened up and he said, the fever's broken. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3962.44s)]
*  We were, there's hope. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3964.7200000000003s)]
*  And we ran up to see Mike just like that. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3966.1600000000003s)]
*  It was, and David Manning was right there. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3969.8s)]
*  My dad was there. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3973.5600000000004s)]
*  My mom, Carrie saw it. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3974.28s)]
*  It was a miracle, man. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3976.7200000000003s)]
*  It was really a miracle and beautiful. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3977.84s)]
*  But I don't want to get into an argument with people in it, but I would love, like [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3980.2s)]
*  I told you, I'd like my life to have an experience that people could benefit from. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3985.24s)]
*  You know, if you're somebody that's like maybe I was at a time, like life is [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3990.16s)]
*  overwhelming and you know what? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3997.3999999999996s)]
*  It's, it's like when you overcome something, you're so much a better man [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=3999.16s)]
*  than you were before. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4004.52s)]
*  It's like when you're pushed to your limit and you have to adjust or die, you get [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4005.7599999999998s)]
*  stronger, you get stronger and go. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4010.96s)]
*  And I would just say to anybody that's out there lost, if you want to feel like [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4013.3199999999997s)]
*  you'll never be afraid of man or beast again, you will not be afraid of dying. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4017.3199999999997s)]
*  If you know where you're going to go when you die. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4021.2s)]
*  And I mean, I know where I'm going to go and I have no fear. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4023.48s)]
*  I mean, it's a, it's a great life. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4027.64s)]
*  Did you, did you have religion instilled in you when you were growing up? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4030.6s)]
*  Did you have like, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4034.3199999999997s)]
*  No, that's a thing. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4035.28s)]
*  We went to church on Easter. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4036.6s)]
*  You know, I remember, but this is a pretty odd story, but I spent the night [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4038.8s)]
*  with my dad's real estate partner, he's a doctor and I spent the night with him [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4045.8s)]
*  one night and the next day was Sunday and they took me to church with them. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4049.88s)]
*  And so I went to church and so the only reason I went, cause if you spent the [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4054.0s)]
*  night, you got to sleep with the dog and I loved their dog, you know. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4058.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4061.76s)]
*  I've stayed over places just to be by the animals. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4062.4s)]
*  Well, we go to church and he, these men surround me and ask me if I [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4065.88s)]
*  want to accept Jesus. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4072.8s)]
*  And so I knew that song, Jesus loves me, you know, and I'd been to [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4074.64s)]
*  wrestling before and I'd seen people poke the finger and stuff. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4078.96s)]
*  And I knew that was bad, you know, when I thought I don't want to be bad. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4081.76s)]
*  I want to be good, you know? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4084.92s)]
*  So, so I want to be on that side, you know, cause I've kind of seen a [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4086.2400000000002s)]
*  little of those words, you know? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4090.2400000000002s)]
*  You weren't a good heal. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4091.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4092.6s)]
*  No, this was the, this was, this was choosing not to be a heal for [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4093.88s)]
*  eternity. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4099.16s)]
*  I mean, well, you know, now that I understand what was going on, cause [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4099.6s)]
*  I was just a little boy, you know? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4105.72s)]
*  So I said the prayer, you know, and they asked me if I believe Jesus died. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4107.44s)]
*  You know, I did. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4111.88s)]
*  And I felt something move in my, something weird in my chest. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4113.16s)]
*  And I thought somebody, there were men standing behind me. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4117.32s)]
*  I thought they did something to me. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4119.52s)]
*  But I actually felt something move inside me. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4120.96s)]
*  And I think it was that little bit of evidence gave me a lot of courage. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4123.4800000000005s)]
*  And I knew God was with me. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4127.280000000001s)]
*  I knew he was. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4128.72s)]
*  And that night I was, got out of my bed and I went and I looked on my [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4130.76s)]
*  porch, I was just looking at the outside, the stars and I'm a little boy. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4135.280000000001s)]
*  I could have imagined it, but I could have sworn I saw an angel fly across [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4141.04s)]
*  the field with a horn in his mouth. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4144.400000000001s)]
*  Like it was blown horn. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4146.68s)]
*  I didn't hear any sound. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4147.6s)]
*  It looked just like a Christmas ornament, a Christmas tree. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4148.68s)]
*  But, but in my mind, this was my best day of my life and I belong to God now. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4152.080000000001s)]
*  And I have never been afraid of anything since then. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4156.96s)]
*  Amen. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4159.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4161.120000000001s)]
*  It's, it's interesting. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4161.320000000001s)]
*  I think people get, sometimes people get scared to share like their testimonies [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4162.160000000001s)]
*  or moments that they've had where they've just felt like something stronger [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4166.400000000001s)]
*  than them took care of them. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4169.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4170.72s)]
*  You know? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4171.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4172.120000000001s)]
*  I remember a feeling one time where I was just broken down, man. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4172.320000000001s)]
*  I was really banged up about a relationship and just not sure what I [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4176.16s)]
*  wanted to do with my life. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4179.96s)]
*  I'd moved back in with my step parents and man, I remember one time I was just [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4180.8s)]
*  just on my knees balling and I felt something come around my heart, man. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4187.12s)]
*  I can't even explain it. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4191.92s)]
*  Just like this, this, this warm thing. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4194.32s)]
*  Just, I mean, I'd never felt where my heart was. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4196.36s)]
*  I mean, I'd put my hand on it, hoping for the best when I was pledging allegiance. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4198.72s)]
*  He's knocking on the door. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4202.08s)]
*  But I mean, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4203.68s)]
*  boy, you're beautiful. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4204.799999999999s)]

*  You're all alone suffering like that. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4206.759999999999s)]
*  God, that was God's Theo. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4209.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4211.04s)]
*  He came to you. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4211.759999999999s)]
*  You know, we got one lifetime to learn it, you know, that there is such a thing. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4213.48s)]
*  I mean, let me tell you, there is a double and people want to say there's no such [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4218.92s)]
*  thing, but there is, boy, I can tell you a really weird story, but it's 100% true. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4222.5199999999995s)]

*  Okay. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4232.679999999999s)]
*  So I'm going to wrestle, but, uh, uh, big daddy, but King Kong, Bundy and, uh, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4232.96s)]
*  sport and the Roger's Coliseum in Fort Worth. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4238.32s)]
*  So I'm on the way of the ring. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4240.84s)]
*  Carrie said, come here. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4241.88s)]
*  I said, what Carrie? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4243.92s)]
*  He said, I was dad on the phone. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4244.48s)]
*  Mike's just been a terrible car wreck. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4246.44s)]
*  He's, he's dying now. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4248.16s)]
*  Dad said, don't try to get there fast because he'll be dead before we get there. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4249.8s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4253.5199999999995s)]
*  And I said, what? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4254.28s)]
*  It's sort of, uh, I ran to the ring. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4255.48s)]
*  I said, ring the bell. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4258.24s)]
*  They ring the bell. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4259.32s)]
*  Grab Bundy's legs, school boy. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4260.24s)]
*  Then one, two, three, ran to the back, carrying a hauled out to the hospital, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4261.88s)]
*  still on my Russian stuff. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4266.32s)]
*  And, uh, so we get there and there's cops everywhere and they're standing by the [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4268.36s)]
*  doors and I run right into my bust open and I, and there's this black lady out [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4272.72s)]
*  there and she said, my baby, my baby. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4277.44s)]
*  And, uh, when I crashed those doors open, there's a little black kid laying there [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4280.0s)]
*  dead and blood and stuff. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4284.36s)]
*  And so I go out the other door, open the door and there's Mike, Hey, Kath, he [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4286.8s)]
*  was fine, just fine. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4292.76s)]
*  And so I I'm like, I'm numb, you know? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4295.68s)]
*  And so I knew my parents were on the way down here. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4299.0s)]
*  And so I go outside and I see them walking down the ramp and I said, he's [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4301.08s)]
*  okay. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4305.4400000000005s)]

*  My mom fell down. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4307.64s)]
*  Well, so I'm going to get my car to come home and Abilene is west, but Denton is [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4310.12s)]
*  north. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4314.64s)]
*  Well, for some reason I went west and I went almost to Abilene, Eastland. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4315.160000000001s)]
*  Just, I was so out of it, just driving. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4321.400000000001s)]

*  And so I was going to take my bulldog down to the lake and wash him. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4329.88s)]
*  I had cast your soap, you know, okay for the environment. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4333.0s)]

*  Let me fight the devil. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4347.24s)]
*  I said, Satan, I want to, I'll fight you. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4348.799999999999s)]
*  I'll fight you. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4351.839999999999s)]
*  And, uh, and so let me fight him. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4353.04s)]
*  God, it was stupid, a stupid boy. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4355.44s)]
*  And so I go to the lake, I'm washing my dog and Theo, I swear this happened. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4359.24s)]
*  So my dog, everything's real still and I'm feeling weird a little bit. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4364.679999999999s)]
*  And I look and I see there's a bush here and some more bushes here in a hill here. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4370.92s)]
*  And I see these little black things taking position against me and advancing on [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4376.68s)]
*  me. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4381.8s)]
*  I felt like I could smell blood. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4382.24s)]
*  I could smell death. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4384.400000000001s)]
*  And I said, get in the car, Pam. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4387.4400000000005s)]
*  And I put my back to the car and I was like this. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4388.76s)]
*  And, uh, and I would see him going from trees, they're getting these positions [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4391.64s)]
*  and I was, I was ready. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4395.84s)]
*  And next thing I know, I'm out. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4397.400000000001s)]
*  I'm having a seizure in my car. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4399.04s)]
*  And, and, and so Pam screaming and crying and these fishermen have run up to help [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4401.92s)]
*  and I must've hit one or kicked one or something. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4407.88s)]
*  But a girl ran up and said, I know his parents, uh, I'll get them. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4410.76s)]
*  And an ambulance came and all that. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4415.4800000000005s)]
*  But I know it's because I'm a man and I challenge the devil and we have Jesus in [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4417.32s)]
*  us that fights the devil. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4423.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't have anything to do with the devil. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4424.84s)]
*  And so that was, that was my lesson that I learned, but I know that happened. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4427.400000000001s)]
*  And it's just in me, like written on my heart and with a nail. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4432.08s)]
*  You know, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4436.6s)]
*  look, that's a testimony, man. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4436.8s)]

*  Thank you for sharing that. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4439.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4440.16s)]
*  I think sometimes we don't think that the devil is real and that's it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4440.320000000001s)]
*  That is the devil's way to trick us. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4442.92s)]
*  I believe that, you know, if you don't think that evil's real, then it's how [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4444.6s)]
*  quick, you don't know how close it is to you either, you know, you don't know how [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4448.280000000001s)]
*  intertwined it could be in your own veins. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4451.88s)]
*  If you don't even believe it's real, that's a pretty masterful trick. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4453.72s)]
*  And we think with a man's mind and they have the devil is an angel's mind. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4456.92s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's way smarter than we are. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4461.68s)]
*  We could never. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4463.56s)]
*  Devil's the devil is a thug. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4464.6s)]
*  You know, that is the truth, man. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4466.400000000001s)]

*  Oh, she took your mom with you? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4605.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4606.88s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4607.280000000001s)]
*  She lived in the house with us too. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4608.320000000001s)]
*  Did she love it there? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4609.72s)]
*  Uh, you know, my dad used to wrestle in Japan a lot. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4611.16s)]
*  And so we would meet him in Hawaii and I didn't realize it, but Hawaii [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4615.320000000001s)]
*  reminded her of her sons and she didn't want to go anywhere. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4619.08s)]
*  She wanted to stay in her room and she wanted to grow her flowers. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4623.68s)]
*  And that was it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4627.12s)]
*  She just, she did love it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4627.88s)]
*  She loves her flowers, you know, but it was like, um, it reminded her too much [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4629.92s)]
*  of that, but she, and she passed away up in our, our guest room upstairs. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4634.639999999999s)]
*  And, uh, but all my granddaughters and my, my son's wives were standing around [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4639.48s)]
*  her singing hymns while she passed away. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4647.16s)]
*  And they'll before she died, she was a super good woman. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4649.32s)]
*  She was so sweet and thoughtful to everyone. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4652.759999999999s)]
*  When she'd come to school, I'll be so proud of her, you know, cause all [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4655.68s)]
*  the kids would like her, but when she was laying in that bed and she [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4659.080000000001s)]
*  breathed her last breath, even as she, like that, her hand went up like that. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4663.280000000001s)]
*  And I could just pitch him touching Jesus' hands and going to heaven, you know. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4669.320000000001s)]
*  She was probably ready to go see her sons. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4674.0s)]
*  Oh, I know she was, you know, my dad. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4675.84s)]
*  Tell you all this personal stuff, buddy, but, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4680.280000000001s)]
*  well, I could match you if you need, but we've heard my stories a lot. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4683.12s)]
*  No, I just can't imagine. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4687.36s)]
*  I bet she was ready to go see her sons. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4688.4s)]
*  You know, I bet she'd been gone away from them long enough. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4690.0s)]
*  And you know, my dad too, because really, when you think about it, my [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4693.36s)]
*  dad lost more than my mom. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4696.8s)]
*  My dad lost his sons, but he didn't, he didn't ever show it. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4698.84s)]
*  I mean, how about he hurt, he was hurting, but he was like, uh, it was just that he, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4702.12s)]
*  uh, at his ladder, in the final days, he was so torn up inside. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4709.72s)]
*  I think when he saw me, it would remind him of all the sons he'd lost. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4715.2s)]
*  And he pulled that 44 out one day and, and he pointed his head like, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4719.240000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to shoot myself. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4725.64s)]
*  No, no, no, don't do it. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4727.08s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4728.240000000001s)]
*  Dad. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4728.68s)]
*  And he pointed the gun at me and I said, he said, you're afraid to die, aren't [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4729.76s)]
*  you? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4734.2s)]
*  Cause, he said, you'd have the guts. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4734.320000000001s)]
*  You do it too. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4737.12s)]
*  If you had the guts. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4738.04s)]
*  And I said, dad, it doesn't take guts to live. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4739.76s)]
*  I mean, it takes guts to kill yourself. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4742.56s)]
*  Dad, it takes guts to stay alive on this earth. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4744.56s)]
*  And, uh, he was hurting so much. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4748.84s)]
*  He was just go, Oh God, he rubbed his face to go, Oh God. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4751.16s)]
*  And when he, I'd hear that, I actually wanted him to die. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4756.04s)]
*  I wanted him to pass away. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4761.28s)]
*  He was, he was just miserable. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4762.48s)]
*  And I know that when he died, he was right there with Dave Carey. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4765.759999999999s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4769.44s)]
*  But my dad had gotten to where he said, look son, uh, if you kick an old dog [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4771.959999999999s)]
*  enough times, he's going to bite you. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4778.599999999999s)]
*  And that's how I am with God right now. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4780.799999999999s)]
*  He sees kick me too many times. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4782.759999999999s)]
*  And so I said, dad, it's going to be, you're going to be so surprised, but I [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4785.2s)]
*  couldn't convince him of it. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4790.759999999999s)]
*  You know, but yeah, I can't imagine. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4791.96s)]
*  I can't imagine what it's like to be kind of the soul, the surviving son. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4795.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you feel chosen or did you feel deserted? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4800.52s)]
*  Does that question make any sense? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4804.68s)]
*  It sure. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4805.8s)]
*  It's funny you say that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4806.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4808.72s)]
*  Because I felt chosen in the way that my dad gave me a tape recorder [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4809.16s)]
*  back when I was in fifth grade. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4815.68s)]
*  It was a bell and how, you know, when you could talk into it and I couldn't believe [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4817.36s)]
*  I could hear my voice, you know? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4821.12s)]
*  And so, uh, and so I thought I love my dad so much. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4822.96s)]
*  I feel the tape. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4827.28s)]
*  It was okay. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4828.0s)]
*  One day dad's going to die and I'm going to talk and here I am alive while he's [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4828.8s)]
*  still alive and so I'm going to say something to make me feel better. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4833.24s)]
*  Man, I'm sorry, sorry, but I just feel the tape up without. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4836.08s)]
*  Oh, as if you were impersonating your dad. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4841.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4842.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4842.96s)]
*  Like I can comfort myself later. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4843.16s)]
*  No dude, that's really interesting though. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4845.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4848.2s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4848.4s)]
*  But I remember saying, uh, Dave and Carrie, we loved each other so much. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4849.12s)]
*  I thought I can't bear to lose them. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4853.8s)]
*  I could not bear it. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4856.36s)]
*  And I thought, but they love me that way. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4858.04s)]
*  And so I said this, even in a prayer, I said, God, if one of us has to stand back, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4860.48s)]
*  if one of us has to be the only one, let it be me because I'm hard and I'm strong [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4866.72s)]
*  inside, God made me that way, but I didn't know it would ever happen, but I did. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4872.0s)]
*  So yeah, you know, you know, I used to have, I mean, this is like silly, but like, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4879.04s)]
*  so when I was growing up, I didn't have any, like whenever my dad died, I didn't [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4884.36s)]
*  have any thing of his, right? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4887.32s)]
*  I didn't have like a shirt or like a button or just anything to remember him by. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4888.84s)]
*  You know? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4891.92s)]
*  And so I used to write postcards to my kids, right? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4892.8s)]
*  Whenever I was on the road, just traveling over the years, doing comedy, I [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4898.28s)]
*  would write postcards to my kids. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4901.2s)]
*  I don't have any kids yet, but I would send them postcards just so in the future, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4902.32s)]
*  they would be able to see that I was thinking of them, right? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4906.72s)]
*  Like I just wanted that. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4909.8s)]
*  I wanted to prove I was like, so smart, bro. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4910.8s)]
*  But right. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4913.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4913.6s)]
*  But I just think it's the same type of thing. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4913.8s)]
*  It's like, you're just trying to like, I don't know. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4915.240000000001s)]
*  You're always thinking of like, um, how do I make sure that every, that somebody knew [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4917.96s)]
*  I cared or that somebody knew somebody else? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4923.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4927.240000000001s)]
*  I'm going to die someday. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4927.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just stuff like that is interesting. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4929.12s)]
*  I think a lot of people do little things like that. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4930.64s)]
*  Um, but that's interesting because you could have felt like you were deserted, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4933.0s)]
*  but to end up feeling that you were chosen, that's pretty powerful. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4938.28s)]
*  Well, I don't think I'd say that word shows more. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4941.6s)]
*  Like I'd say that I, I would not want to put them through that. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4943.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4948.96s)]
*  Like you were the one that could handle it. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4949.64s)]
*  Then I think I would not want them to go through it. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4951.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4954.24s)]
*  I would rather me go through it than they did. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4954.6s)]
*  And I think that's sweet of God might've gave me some credit for that, you know, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4956.4800000000005s)]
*  because it's all about this. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4960.96s)]
*  We're in a struggle, you know, it's like, we're not on this earth to laugh it up [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4963.84s)]
*  and have fun. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4968.24s)]
*  We have tests, real tests and life is hard. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4968.88s)]
*  And that kind of stuff that kicks you in the nuts is what makes you stronger. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4972.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4977.08s)]
*  Makes you more strong. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4977.32s)]
*  And without that, you can't give advice to people about things you haven't been [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4978.68s)]
*  around, you know, but once you've had it and been suffered yourself, now you can [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4982.36s)]

*  when you're a kid as much that, and they really shouldn't when you're a young [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=4996.32s)]

*  But, um, you know, it's tough cause I want to tell people like when somebody [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5052.84s)]
*  dies, it's going to get better, but it doesn't get better, man. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5058.24s)]
*  You don't even get used to it. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5061.92s)]
*  It just keep tolerating it and you just somehow it gets a little better someday. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5063.4s)]

*  know, and when you overcome that and are able to, um, um, maintain through that, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5074.08s)]
*  well, then it's, it's now you, now you've, uh, you've achieved through a struggle. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5086.12s)]

*  There can't be a champion. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5105.96s)]
*  There can't be a success unless there's that adversity, you know? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5106.96s)]
*  And so God wouldn't put you through that unless you're going to benefit. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5111.28s)]

*  He found that stuff all the time. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5417.2s)]
*  So that's what he was really doing, but he was a great artist. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5419.0s)]
*  He could draw anything, you know? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5421.48s)]
*  And so I thought that, but he was, uh, he had asthma and so, because he had to [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5423.04s)]
*  take medicine, it made his bones brittle and he, uh, he just wasn't going to [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5428.48s)]
*  get big and strong, you know, it just didn't, when he worked out, it didn't [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5433.759999999999s)]

*  That's what I've thought. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5442.64s)]
*  I've thought maybe we took all the big because he wanted to be, I could have [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5443.4800000000005s)]

*  and grabbing with their hands too. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5738.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm using gloves, but she's, she's something else. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5740.24s)]
*  She could, she can run like a deer. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5743.92s)]
*  She, um, and she loves her and her sons are all athletic. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5746.320000000001s)]
*  I could go overboard talking about her. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5751.4400000000005s)]
*  She's such an athlete. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5753.400000000001s)]
*  And, and then there's Ross and Marsh. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5755.08s)]
*  And Ross and Marshall got into wrestling. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5757.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5759.200000000001s)]
*  Did, were you scared when they got into wrestling or did you have any thoughts [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5759.72s)]
*  about it or that's just what they wanted to do? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5762.200000000001s)]
*  Well, uh, not with Ross. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5765.0s)]
*  I knew Ross is, he's been an ass kicker his whole life and he fights easily, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5767.4400000000005s)]
*  you know, and that's not usually, there's not much for a man that was doing [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5774.719999999999s)]
*  today's world except wrestling. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5778.04s)]
*  And so Ross is going to be good. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5779.919999999999s)]
*  But Marshall, I did worry about him because Marshall was a super athlete. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5781.679999999999s)]
*  He went out to Hawaii and he was the quarterback and he was throwing the [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5787.12s)]
*  bombs, the newspapers were just, people would just want a picture of how far [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5790.919999999999s)]
*  he could throw the football. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5795.879999999999s)]
*  He was, he was just a great athlete, but I worried about him getting that sun, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5796.799999999999s)]
*  that heat stroke out there, you know, cause he had a heat issue one time. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5802.2s)]
*  So that's the only time I've ever been worried of him, worried of him. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5806.8s)]
*  Cause they're both like bulls, you know, they're strong and healthy. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5808.92s)]
*  And I wouldn't worry about it either way. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5812.04s)]
*  They, with their wrestling now too, they, they know what they need to know. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5814.56s)]
*  They're, it's, I believe that the wrestling business is about to really [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5819.0s)]
*  explode because it was just like this when my brothers and I got started. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5823.64s)]
*  And when this COVID got in, they had to wrestle in empty buildings. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5827.88s)]
*  I don't think I could have ever done that. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5831.24s)]
*  But, it made it where the people really have not seen them explode yet. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5833.24s)]
*  They've, they worked for a little, they went to Japan and wrestled and they [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5839.8s)]
*  worked for a little operation at MLW and now they're with AEW. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5845.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5850.96s)]
*  AEW has been popping off. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5851.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5853.32s)]
*  I keep hearing about it all the time now. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5853.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5855.72s)]
*  They're, they're going to be, they're really going to be special, I believe. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5856.08s)]
*  And are, will they tag team? [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5859.16s)]
*  They've done both. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5861.5199999999995s)]
*  They, they work tag teams right now though. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5862.24s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot of, you know, there's a tag teams, it's such an interesting, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5864.04s)]
*  it's exciting match, you know, cause the guys don't have time to get a hold, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5867.8s)]
*  but they can do either one. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5871.68s)]
*  They can wrestle single, they can work a tag. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5873.72s)]
*  But probably they'll work a tag team. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5876.28s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I don't want to talk out of school, but we have a [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5880.76s)]
*  neighbor in Bernie and it's Bill Goldberg, the guy that wrestled at WWE. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5884.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5889.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5890.84s)]
*  He, he, he's a Texas boy, I think, in New York, Oklahoma. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5891.12s)]
*  Bill Goldberg. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5896.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5896.639999999999s)]
*  I think it's from Oklahoma. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5896.72s)]
*  Where is he from? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5897.44s)]
*  Norman? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5897.88s)]
*  No. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5898.5199999999995s)]
*  It's also Oklahoma. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5899.0s)]
*  Um, did you ever fight Rocky Johnson? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5900.96s)]
*  Uh, he, I was too young, but my first black and white pictures, uh, that [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5904.639999999999s)]
*  was trying to flex, you know, and I've never, I didn't know, you know, I [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5911.8s)]
*  didn't expect to have muscles, but that's Rocky. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5915.36s)]
*  And so Rocky's was really good at flexing. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5918.12s)]
*  And so Rocky taught me everything about flexing, you know, he was standing [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5920.240000000001s)]
*  right behind the camera and doing this and doing all these things and whatever [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5923.400000000001s)]
*  Rocky did, I did for the picture. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5927.16s)]
*  So you learned a little from him then. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5930.88s)]
*  And Rocky's son is the Rock, you know. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5932.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5936.2s)]
*  Dwayne Johnson. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5936.84s)]
*  And so we would like that. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5937.72s)]
*  That's actually the picture. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5938.96s)]
*  That's hilarious, dude. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5941.08s)]
*  But little Rock was there. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5942.96s)]

*  I mean, he was the cutest little kid. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5947.759999999999s)]
*  People say that Rocky was the night is a, is a very nice guy. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5950.36s)]
*  He's still alive. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5953.4s)]
*  He is. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5954.04s)]
*  I don't know about that, but, but Rock was a great guy too. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5954.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, he, he was a, he was a little younger than us, you know, so we'd [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5959.04s)]
*  wrestle him and, uh, like, like his, uh, we'd frustrate him and boy, to see [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5962.799999999999s)]
*  if he'd have the courage to belt, to pep up with it and he would too. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5968.92s)]
*  Dwayne Johnson, the Rock? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5972.639999999999s)]
*  He would fight. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5973.679999999999s)]
*  He would want to fight. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5974.24s)]
*  He's that pup was, will bite you. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5976.679999999999s)]

*  Uh, y'all might've put the, y'all might've excited. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5981.24s)]
*  Y'all might've put that fire in a man. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5982.92s)]
*  Um, what about bruiser Brody? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5984.92s)]
*  Remember him? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5986.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5987.24s)]
*  He was something else. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5988.48s)]
*  Smart guy. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5989.679999999999s)]
*  Uh, on his wake up workout routine, he would just put on leather gloves and [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5990.679999999999s)]
*  lay into that heavy bag and it thickened his chest. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5996.0s)]
*  And I mean, he did bench presses too, but he had an awesome bench press, but [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=5999.44s)]
*  also his body was built so powerfully because he had it. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6004.0s)]
*  I think he worked out different. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6008.24s)]
*  He did a lot of strikes, you know, and that thickens joints and all made him [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6009.4s)]
*  make you have kind of that raw strength, you know, and he'd had that. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6013.16s)]
*  Uh, if you want to talk about Puerto Rico, well, I can tell you too, that [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6018.32s)]
*  what happened? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6023.76s)]
*  Well, he was killed in Puerto Rico. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6025.16s)]
*  You know, oh, he was killed in Puerto Rico. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6026.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6028.4800000000005s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6029.12s)]
*  Well, gosh, I never told this story, but I could tell you this one too. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6029.68s)]
*  Uh, he was Brody got, was real temperamental and he would get pissed off real easy. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6033.68s)]
*  Well, the Puerto Rico wrestling office owed him about 80 grand. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6040.92s)]
*  And so my dad was president of the Alliance back then. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6045.96s)]
*  And so we worked out a payout schedule where they'd pay him a little each show. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6048.6s)]
*  But Brody got that show and he wouldn't work for him because they owed him that [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6054.52s)]
*  money. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6058.28s)]
*  And so dad worked it out where he would come back and boy, when they came back, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6058.88s)]
*  they sold out San Juan and it was a great crowd where Brody wanted his money that [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6062.4s)]
*  night because he saw that they had it. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6069.24s)]
*  But you know, there are other things that they've, you know, and, uh, that's all [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6071.679999999999s)]
*  that started. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6076.36s)]
*  That's all that started. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6077.24s)]
*  So he, uh, wanted his money and, um, uh, wanted to be. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6078.28s)]
*  And so he kicked the guy's ass, you know, and the guy's a little invader, you [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6084.24s)]
*  know, forgot his name, but, um, man, this is an ugly story too, but, uh, the guy [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6089.76s)]
*  who, and so they got in a fight and the guy Brody beat him up and he knifed [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6098.4800000000005s)]
*  Brody in the shower. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6103.64s)]
*  But, um, this is the kind of guy, I mean, the guy that did it just about a week [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6105.400000000001s)]
*  before that, his little daughter drowned in his swimming pool. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6111.4400000000005s)]
*  So he's on edge, you know, and, uh, so I can't really, I know I'm both, you know, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6115.56s)]
*  and they're both men that want to earn their living, you know, and, uh, it's sad. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6123.2s)]
*  Oh, that's him, Jose Gonzalez. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6129.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6131.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6133.8s)]
*  Life is, you know, like I said, we suffer, we find the beautiful moments in between [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6134.08s)]
*  those ugly ones, you know, and it's, it's good. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6139.68s)]
*  It's got good and bad. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6142.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6145.28s)]
*  I, um, I'm trying to think if there was something else that you talked about using [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6145.56s)]
*  a medicinal marijuana, how did you get into that? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6149.32s)]
*  And then how did it help you? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6151.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you feel like, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6153.36s)]
*  well, if you want to talk about it, if you don't want to, that's fine. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6156.12s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6158.72s)]
*  Well, um, well, I'll have a lot of knee or certain knee surgeries too. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6159.64s)]
*  And, uh, and you can take a pain pill, but if you do, then it's going to take an edge [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6164.64s)]
*  off of it and so you'll want to take more. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6171.08s)]
*  And if you do, you're going to get in a problem. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6173.64s)]
*  And so I didn't want pain pills. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6175.52s)]
*  So I wanted a natural pain relief. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6177.68s)]
*  And so I tried cannabis and I liked it. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6181.240000000001s)]
*  And, uh, it was, it's, it was just good all around for me. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6184.6s)]
*  It was good. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6188.72s)]
*  And so I actually grow it out in Kauai and, uh, and so that's how, you know, I [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6190.080000000001s)]
*  have, have, have it, you know, I'm so grateful for it too. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6197.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I hope they don't make it illegal again, because it was, it's like [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6200.24s)]
*  a wonder drug to me, it really was. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6204.5599999999995s)]
*  Did you ever get involved in any other type of plant medicine or [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6207.5599999999995s)]
*  anything like that out there? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6210.28s)]

*  We've done, I've done that before. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6214.88s)]
*  And a lot of our listeners have, um, I think have considered it or tried it. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6216.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's a stuff called, um, uh, Oh, it's a, what's the name of that? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6220.44s)]

*  I guess that's if you do too much of it or something. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6251.8s)]
*  I tried it. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6253.76s)]
*  It's not bad for you. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6254.5599999999995s)]

*  It's really fascinating. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6277.04s)]
*  Like a sweat lodge kind of thing, maybe. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6277.8s)]

*  The truth is we had a great time. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6392.44s)]

*  Hell yeah. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6395.88s)]
*  We're still talking about how good the time was. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6396.2s)]
*  So I'm not, I can't call it a bad day. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6399.88s)]
*  Is there any message you think that your father, brothers like felt like that? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6403.28s)]
*  You think that they would want to have given, but they didn't get a chance to, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6406.599999999999s)]
*  is there ever anything like that? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6409.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6411.68s)]
*  I want to tell you something. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6413.12s)]
*  Now we watched my dad wrestle home, real little boys, and we had an idea to make [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6414.599999999999s)]
*  a wrestling show that would be different. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6419.68s)]
*  It would be two different, two hot cameras the whole time. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6421.84s)]
*  So nothing's going to look bad on television. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6425.0s)]
*  It was just the best camera shot. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6428.6s)]
*  It would have done some, uh, some, um, extra time editing, but you know, we [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6430.56s)]
*  wanted wrestling to be instead of the 20 and 30 minute matches, one hour time [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6437.040000000001s)]
*  limits, we thought 20 minutes was plenty of time for a match to just pick up the [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6441.68s)]
*  pace, you know, and, uh, and just make it more intense. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6447.280000000001s)]
*  And I think our shows were like that. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6451.0s)]
*  I'm proud of them. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6453.4s)]
*  I'm proud of all of our shows and my brothers and I, especially Dave and I, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6454.2s)]
*  and I had had a great idea one time and it was going to be, uh, to put our new [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6459.6s)]
*  style of wrestling on the show on them. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6466.56s)]
*  And it was great. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6468.84s)]
*  We had a great TV rating and Vince offered us a big part of his, uh, half of [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6469.68s)]
*  his company up there to come in with him. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6475.2s)]
*  And I sat there with my dad and I said, Nope, what's in it for us? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6478.080000000001s)]
*  Uh, and you never disagree with family and a business meeting, but I was thinking [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6482.72s)]
*  he's got everything we need, uh, everything we need, but, uh, dad wouldn't [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6489.320000000001s)]
*  go, wouldn't go with him to partner with WWE. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6495.6s)]
*  You mean? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-U2xkL-BSI&t=6498.400000000001s)]
