*  I feel lucky to get to sit down with him [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=94.86s)]
*  and spend some time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  Today's guest is Mr. Tony Robbins. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=97.54s)]

*  I have so many of my friends are fans of yours [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=133.44s)]
*  and that's how I became a fan. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=134.82s)]
*  I got to listen to you and left my tail off here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=136.14s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=138.3s)]
*  You really bring a different color to things, it's fantastic. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=139.14s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what we're doing a lot of times. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=140.98s)]
*  That's when you do your best, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=143.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=145.02s)]
*  And it just flows. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  It just flows. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=146.7s)]
*  Yeah, you know what, yeah, I guess it is, man. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=147.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, actually. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  It's weird how much you can kind of plan [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=150.7s)]
*  and then, but if you can show up [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=152.78s)]
*  with a level of unplanned kind of like. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=154.46s)]
*  Spontaneous is always much more funny [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=156.7s)]
*  and much more powerful, I think. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=158.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I guess you, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=159.82s)]
*  cause you probably, cause you do so many things. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=161.34s)]
*  I mean, even after just seeing and hearing a lot [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  about you online and just over the years, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=165.62s)]
*  you do so many things to try and fine tune yourself, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=167.46s)]
*  Would you, is that a safe way to say that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I know, and I have certain fundamentals [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=172.78s)]
*  that I want to cover, but every time you enter an audience [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=174.38s)]
*  and you got 15,000 people, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=176.38s)]
*  you got to hold them for 12 hours a day [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=178.62s)]
*  for five or six days when they wouldn't usually sit [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=180.46s)]
*  for a 30 minute video or three hour movie. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=182.42s)]
*  So you got to really be able to adapt [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=187.18s)]
*  and feel what's there just like you and adapt. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  And it's got to be funny. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=190.9s)]
*  I mean, if all you do is get up and talk for 12 hours, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=191.74s)]
*  you want to kill yourself, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=193.9s)]
*  So you got to make people laugh. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=194.98s)]
*  You got to move them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=196.54s)]
*  You got to produce all those things. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=197.38s)]
*  Cause time is so relative. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=198.74s)]
*  Like how long is a long time? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=200.98s)]
*  Some people think, well, you know, a thousand years. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=202.18s)]
*  Some people think two minutes, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=204.38s)]
*  So a long time is when you're not enjoying yourself. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  You know, a minute feels like eternity. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=208.62s)]
*  Oh, it's the worst day. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=209.94s)]
*  But if you're fully engaged and you're enjoying everything, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=211.1s)]
*  like 12 hours goes like that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=213.46s)]
*  So it's fun to see the impact you can have with people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=215.38s)]
*  when you're willing to adapt. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=218.18s)]
*  It was the same every time also. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  I'd be bored out of my mind. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  Just like- At your live events, you mean? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=223.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I mean, it's definitely remarkable. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=224.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think I was thinking about like tuning, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=227.22s)]
*  like more just like in your regular life [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=229.02s)]
*  and like you're being ready for the day. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=231.26s)]
*  Like what is that tuning like for you? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=234.14s)]
*  Cause that's a constant, like that's always evolving. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  Like every couple of months now we hear about some new thing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=239.38s)]
*  or some new method or somebody's, you know, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=241.98s)]
*  people are hiding underground for two hours or whatever. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  People are, you know, there's people like who, you know, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=246.94s)]
*  won't let their shadow outside for a month [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=249.94s)]
*  and it's supposed to help them process limp or whatever. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, so there's so many things. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  And what are some things that you do [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=256.42s)]
*  that really make you feel like, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=259.85999999999996s)]
*  that didn't feel like snake oil kind of, you know? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=263.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, some things I do, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=265.26s)]
*  I've been doing for like 20 years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=266.58s)]
*  Like, you know, I start every day in a cold plunge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=268.38s)]
*  Now it's very popular, you know, ice bath and so forth. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=270.9s)]
*  But I don't, there's never a day I look forward to it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=273.74s)]
*  I don't wake up and go, I can't wait to freeze my ass off. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  But I, to me, it's a discipline. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=278.74s)]
*  It's like training my mind, besides the physical benefit. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, it doesn't feel good when you go in, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  but you feel amazing coming out. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=283.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, brother. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=285.06s)]
*  Cause your entire body gets flooded, right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=285.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. Your lymph, your blood moves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=287.7s)]
*  But going in, it's like, I don't negotiate with myself. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't go, oh, let me see if I'm ready. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  It's like, I've trained my brain. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=293.61999999999995s)]
*  I say, go, we go. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=294.82s)]
*  In my home in Sun Valley, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=296.17999999999995s)]
*  I walk through the snow and get in the river. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. You know, that's like, you know, 41 degrees. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  And I mean, it's intense, but when you train your brain, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  that when I say go, go, no negotiation, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  then that shows up in every other part of your life. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=307.9s)]
*  So I do that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=309.46s)]
*  I, you know, I work out every day, obviously. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=310.5s)]
*  I do a 10 minute process. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=312.46s)]
*  It's not really a meditation [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=313.94s)]
*  cause I'm not good at not thinking. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=315.9s)]
*  And I don't know how many people are that have no thoughts, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=317.74s)]
*  but I do a way to kind of condition [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=319.94s)]
*  my nervous system in my mind. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=321.82s)]
*  It's really simple. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=323.18s)]
*  I do these three pieces, three minutes each. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=324.02s)]
*  It's only 10 minutes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=325.94s)]
*  So if I said 20 minutes, people say, I don't have time, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=327.3s)]
*  but 10, even though 10 minutes for your life, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=329.26s)]
*  you don't have a life, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=330.94s)]
*  So I just do three minutes of what are the emotions [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=332.14s)]
*  that mess people up in the relationship or their business? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=334.94s)]
*  It's usually anger or fear. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=337.74s)]
*  Some derivative of those two. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=339.42s)]
*  So the antidote to those is gratitude. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=341.1s)]
*  You can't be angry and grateful simultaneously. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=343.18s)]
*  You can't be fearful and grateful simultaneously. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=345.66s)]
*  So I train my nervous system by starting every morning. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=348.14s)]
*  I do this process to change my body. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=350.74s)]
*  It's a breathing process. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=352.54s)]
*  And then I think of one at a time, a minute each, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  I see and feel something in my life [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=356.62s)]
*  that I'm really grateful for. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=358.7s)]
*  I do little things and big things. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=359.86s)]
*  So you don't have to have a giant thing to be grateful. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's real. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=363.74s)]
*  It's not like I'm seeing it over there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=364.66s)]
*  It's like I'm experiencing it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=366.02s)]
*  So it changes your biochemistry. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=367.38s)]
*  So when you say experience it, not to interrupt you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=368.9s)]
*  Yeah, no, go for it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=370.62s)]
*  Interrupt me as much as you want. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=371.46s)]
*  But no, that's what, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=372.5s)]
*  cause I'll forget what the question is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  That's the only reason it's like a desperation. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=377.5s)]
*  Yeah, so in that moment, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  cause I know what you're talking about, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=380.42s)]
*  I'll make a gratitude list, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=381.26s)]
*  But sometimes it's like, I'm just writing the things down [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  and there's no real connection inside of me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=385.02000000000004s)]
*  That won't do much. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=386.94s)]
*  And I know it won't do, it's like, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  I know this thing can help. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=389.1s)]
*  At least I'm doing the practice. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=390.06s)]
*  But I know it's not gonna have like a, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=391.62s)]
*  I can tell even right now, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=393.94s)]
*  it's not gonna help me that much. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=395.62s)]
*  So what are you saying that somebody could do? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=397.62s)]
*  I'm saying I close my eyes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=399.74s)]
*  Sometimes if I said, think of a time [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=401.18s)]
*  when you rode a roller coaster [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=402.66s)]
*  and you remembered over there, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=404.02s)]
*  like see it over there, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=405.21999999999997s)]
*  that's called disassociated. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  But if I get you to imagine being in the front seat [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=408.06s)]
*  and you might tell me, oh, it was pretty interesting. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=410.18s)]
*  But if I get you go back to actually the moment [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=412.18s)]
*  when you're coming over the edge, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=413.94s)]
*  and then you see even right now, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=415.7s)]
*  you can see, oh, you know. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=417.14s)]
*  So that's what I do with the gratitude. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=418.46s)]
*  I get in my body as if I was then, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=420.29999999999995s)]
*  see it and feel it and experience it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=422.18s)]
*  And that creates a biochemical change in your body [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=423.85999999999996s)]
*  as opposed to a thought. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  A thought's not enough, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=427.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=428.7s)]
*  So, and you do three of those. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  And then I have three minutes [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=430.62s)]
*  of kind of a cleansing of my body [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=431.7s)]
*  that I do mentally and kind of a prayer for others. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=433.38s)]
*  And then I do three minutes of what I call three to thrive. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=435.98s)]
*  I think of three things I wanna make happen, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=438.9s)]
*  outcomes, results. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  And I don't sit there and beg for them or pray for them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=442.42s)]
*  I see them as done. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=444.7s)]
*  I feel them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=445.98s)]
*  I celebrate them as done. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=446.82s)]
*  Because when your subconscious mind believes it's done, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  it makes it happen. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=450.06s)]
*  So it's kind of programming it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=450.9s)]
*  And the whole thing only takes 10 minutes. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=452.3s)]
*  If anybody wants to do it, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=453.86s)]
*  they can go to tonyraddons.com forward slash priming. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=454.7s)]
*  There's no cost for it and shows you how to do it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=456.98s)]
*  But we do it with 20,000 people in the stadium. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=458.98s)]
*  And the energy that you have at the end, that's amazing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=462.22s)]
*  Because otherwise you wake up and what do you have? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  The first thing is your phone. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=465.74s)]
*  And your phone has a mixture of things. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=467.1s)]
*  If you have, like you do, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=468.98s)]
*  a lot of responsibilities and companies and things. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=470.38000000000005s)]
*  I look at my fingers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh, that's, oh, oh. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=472.86s)]
*  It's like, you're not in control of your life. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=473.70000000000005s)]
*  So I set my life first. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=477.38000000000005s)]
*  I prime. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  What I mean by priming is priming is a psychological principle. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=480.18s)]
*  A lot of times when people feel, think something, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=483.06s)]
*  oh, that's my thought. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=485.3s)]
*  But it's been primed by something in the environment. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=486.86s)]
*  I'm gonna give you an interesting study. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=489.14000000000004s)]
*  They did this at Harvard. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  They took men and women, trained them as actors. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=491.18s)]
*  They went out and did this very simple thing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=494.62s)]
*  They would go out to people and have a cup of coffee. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=496.5s)]
*  And they rehearsed doing it the exact way every time. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=498.74s)]
*  They walk up to you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=500.94s)]
*  You know the mall. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=501.78000000000003s)]
*  And these are actors doing it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=502.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're doing it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  In the mall or someplace else, they see you sitting there [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=504.3s)]
*  and they go, excuse me. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=505.14s)]
*  They go, excuse me. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=505.98s)]
*  Or university campus and they're holding a coffee. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=507.18s)]
*  And they go, could you hold this for a second? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  And they don't ask. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=510.58s)]
*  They put it in your hand and they look down. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=511.42s)]
*  So 90% of people take it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=512.82s)]
*  And they reach in their pocket, did something with their phone. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=514.86s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=516.82s)]
*  That's it, and walk away. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=517.78s)]
*  Well, half those people they did that with had hot coffee. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=519.64s)]
*  The other half had cold iced coffee. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=523.48s)]
*  So then 15 minutes later, approximately, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  15 to 20 minutes later, somebody comes by [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  and they have this little sheet, you know, clipboard. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=530.68s)]
*  And they say, hey, I've got $20. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=533.76s)]
*  If you'll give me 60 seconds of your time, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=535.28s)]
*  would you take 20 seconds to read this little paragraph [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=537.76s)]
*  of a story and then tell me afterwards, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  I have two questions. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=543.0s)]
*  So they read the story and they say, okay, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=544.24s)]
*  tell me what was this person like? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=545.96s)]
*  How would you describe this character? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=547.26s)]
*  The coffee person you mean? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=550.16s)]
*  No, they don't remember that person. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=551.56s)]
*  Oh, the story, from the story. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=552.88s)]
*  No, it's a new person. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  20 bucks, most people do it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=555.28s)]
*  20 bucks for a minute, okay, I'll do it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=556.6s)]
*  Some people say, I don't need the 20 bucks, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=558.12s)]
*  I'll just answer your question. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=560.16s)]
*  They read this little story, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=560.98s)]
*  it's the same story for everybody. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  And then they ask them afterwards, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=563.64s)]
*  how would you describe the main character? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=564.76s)]
*  The people that got hot coffee, 81% of them say, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=566.6999999999999s)]
*  the person is warm and generous. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=570.24s)]
*  When they give them the iced coffee, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=572.88s)]
*  they don't even know it affected them. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  80%, 1% difference is variable, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=576.12s)]
*  will say the person is cold or uncaring. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=578.3s)]
*  No way. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  Same story. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=581.78s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=582.62s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  You can do this with creativity. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=584.28s)]
*  If I said to you, if I talk to an audience, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=585.62s)]
*  they'll say, make the sound of what you think [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=588.3399999999999s)]
*  of when you think of Microsoft and you get, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=589.6999999999999s)]
*  make the sound of Apple. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=592.02s)]
*  That's a trillion dollar difference in people's response. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=593.9799999999999s)]
*  So they've done creativity tests. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=596.62s)]
*  Will that have people watch a 30 second Apple commercial [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=598.5999999999999s)]
*  or just look at the Apple logo [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=600.88s)]
*  and then look at an IBM commercial or an IBM logo. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=602.8199999999999s)]
*  20% higher score on a creativity test [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=606.34s)]
*  they take right after that for those [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=608.9s)]
*  who just looked at the Apple commercial. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=610.38s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=611.94s)]
*  So we can be influenced so powerfully. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=613.14s)]
*  So I decide I want to advertise in my own mind. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=615.46s)]
*  I'm not gonna have somebody else take control. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=617.4200000000001s)]
*  And so I prime myself every day. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=618.98s)]
*  I prime my brain so it's in a grateful state. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=620.9s)]
*  It's an anticipatory state. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=623.5s)]
*  It's a moving state. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=624.94s)]
*  Because otherwise you get whatever you feel like. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=625.7800000000001s)]
*  And I don't know about you, there are days I wake up, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=627.38s)]
*  I don't know what city I'm in. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=629.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's a morning. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=630.46s)]
*  My body's gone, I forgot three hours sleep [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=631.3000000000001s)]
*  and I'm in a time zone. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=632.86s)]
*  So if I didn't reset, then it'd be fake. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=634.14s)]
*  I'd be getting up trying to talk to people [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=636.62s)]
*  and I'm not really, you can't move people [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=638.18s)]
*  if you're not moving. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=640.46s)]
*  You can't touch people if you're not touched. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=641.3s)]
*  You can't make people laugh if it doesn't make you laugh. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=642.42s)]
*  That's really true. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=645.02s)]
*  So I try to make sure I'm in that place every single day. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=646.14s)]
*  And then when you do it every day, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=649.34s)]
*  it trains your nervous system to look for things [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=650.3s)]
*  to be grateful for. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=652.22s)]
*  Then your mind starts to become conditioned. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=653.42s)]
*  Because most people. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=655.26s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=656.22s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=657.06s)]
*  If you don't, they're just habits. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=657.88s)]
*  So if you don't use your mind, your mind will use you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=660.1s)]
*  It's like technology. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=662.5s)]
*  Technology do amazing things. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=664.62s)]
*  Or you can let your technology start using you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=666.02s)]
*  where your whole life is controlled by. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  You can be gambling on your phone even. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=668.66s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=670.46s)]
*  And that's just, you could be doing anything. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=671.3s)]
*  God, it's upsetting. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=673.66s)]
*  I mean, I've been obviously, I have blockers on my phone now [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=676.02s)]
*  because obviously I can't, whatever. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=679.58s)]
*  But that's amazing. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=682.3s)]
*  No, that's something that we don't think about a lot [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=684.06s)]
*  is like instead of just looking at the world, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=686.06s)]
*  why don't you clean the weapon [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=688.1s)]
*  that you're looking at the world with? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=690.34s)]
*  You got it, you got it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=691.78s)]
*  Because people, think of it this way, Theo. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=693.14s)]
*  People don't experience life. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=694.78s)]
*  They experience the life they focus on. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=696.98s)]
*  So right now, if you're happy, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=699.18s)]
*  you are deleting all the things you could be pissed off about [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=702.22s)]
*  or frustrated or worried about in the world. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=704.42s)]
*  If you're unhappy, you're deleting all the things [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  that are great in your life. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=708.46s)]
*  And our brains delete and they distort and they generalize. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=709.78s)]
*  So if you don't direct it, you get whatever shows up. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=712.58s)]
*  What's wrong is always available. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=715.8199999999999s)]
*  What's wrong in the world is always available. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=717.22s)]
*  What's right is also available. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=718.74s)]
*  It's just which one you pick. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=720.1s)]
*  And it isn't about positive thinking. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=721.38s)]
*  I've never been into positive thinking. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=723.38s)]
*  People think that's what I do. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=724.74s)]
*  It's not. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=725.98s)]
*  I believe in intelligence. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=726.82s)]
*  And so when you're in a lousy state of mind, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=728.1400000000001s)]
*  you treat people poorly, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=730.58s)]
*  you don't perform at the highest level, you're not happy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=731.74s)]
*  When you're in a great state of mind, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=734.0600000000001s)]
*  you treat people better, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=735.2600000000001s)]
*  perform at a different place. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=736.1s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons humor is so valuable. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=737.1400000000001s)]
*  It changes people's state. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=739.4200000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're in a different place. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=740.94s)]
*  They respond in a different place [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=742.98s)]
*  when they're laughing than when they're pissed off. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=744.0600000000001s)]
*  So why not train yourself to do that? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=746.1400000000001s)]
*  You've trained yourself to find what's entertaining [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  or funny and just about anything. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=750.98s)]
*  I think that's what makes you as good as you are [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=751.86s)]
*  in that area. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=752.98s)]
*  You have developed patterns of how to do it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=753.82s)]
*  You may not even be conscious of them all. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=755.58s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I was conscious. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=757.0200000000001s)]
*  I don't think there are conscious patterns, but I think. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=757.86s)]
*  But you're a master at that. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=759.46s)]
*  Sometimes, yeah, the best part is when my brain [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=760.74s)]
*  will make me laugh and I didn't even have anything to do. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=763.74s)]
*  Because after a while- [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=766.9000000000001s)]
*  It's subconscious. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=767.74s)]
*  Yeah, and you're like, sometimes I'll just bust out laughing. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=768.58s)]
*  I'll be like, thank you so much. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=771.34s)]
*  My brain just does a little joke for me or something. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=773.74s)]
*  And this goes right into something I was thinking about [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=777.74s)]
*  since it's the new year, you know? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=779.3000000000001s)]
*  And happy new year to you. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=780.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=781.9000000000001s)]
*  And yeah, because people so often say, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=782.74s)]
*  like, New Year's resolution, or they're like, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=785.98s)]
*  but that doesn't really, that's kind of like a one and done. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=787.6600000000001s)]
*  It feels almost outdated, that idea. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=791.1s)]
*  But how do you change, I guess, and you just kind of answered, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=793.58s)]
*  I guess, like how we change our perspective. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=795.98s)]
*  So we change our attitude, you know? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=797.82s)]
*  That's really what you need to have a new experience. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=800.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's three decisions [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=803.4200000000001s)]
*  you're making every moment you're alive. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=805.22s)]
*  Your audience can test this out. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=807.0200000000001s)]
*  The first one is what are you going to focus on? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=808.26s)]
*  When I say you make these decisions, Theo, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=809.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't mean you're making them all consciously, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=811.86s)]
*  So whatever you focus on, that's what you feel. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=814.18s)]
*  If you're supposed to meet your boyfriend, girlfriend, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=816.86s)]
*  husband, wife, whoever, at seven o'clock, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=818.62s)]
*  you get there at seven, they're not there. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=820.06s)]
*  Some people are pissed off, some people are worried. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  It's the same event. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=823.8199999999999s)]
*  If it's 7.30 and they're not there, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=824.98s)]
*  they've not called, they've not texted. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=826.4599999999999s)]
*  Now what are you feeling? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=828.14s)]
*  Some people are, I'm really pissed off, I'm really worried. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=828.98s)]
*  I'm really single. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=831.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm really single. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=832.02s)]
*  It's 8.30, I haven't showed up, I'm full. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=833.66s)]
*  I didn't wait for the bastard. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=835.38s)]
*  But the point is, whether you're angry [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=837.34s)]
*  or whether you're worried, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=839.94s)]
*  had nothing to do with the event. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=841.5s)]
*  It's the habits of your mind. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=843.14s)]
*  The person who's worried thinks, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=844.6600000000001s)]
*  well, maybe they're in a car accident, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=846.7s)]
*  the person's pissed off, they did it again. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=848.22s)]
*  So the first decision you make is, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=850.22s)]
*  what are you going to focus on? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=852.0600000000001s)]
*  And most people have patterns of focus. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=853.02s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=855.1s)]
*  So there's three I'll give you, your audience can test out. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=855.94s)]
*  Do you tend to focus more on what you have [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=858.02s)]
*  or what's missing? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=859.9s)]
*  What's missing. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=861.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=862.5s)]
*  Do you tend to focus more on what you can control [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=863.34s)]
*  or what you can't control? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=866.1s)]
*  Probably what I can't control, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=868.1800000000001s)]
*  but it's out of desperation [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=869.58s)]
*  because I feel like I have to control everything. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=870.74s)]
*  Well, that's not a bad thing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=872.58s)]
*  You can't control everything, right? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=873.74s)]
*  It's an illusion, but you can influence so much. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=874.82s)]
*  You can control everything in you. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=876.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=877.62s)]
*  And then the third one, do you tend to focus more [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=878.46s)]
*  on the past, the present, or the future? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=880.0600000000001s)]
*  The past. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=882.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=883.14s)]
*  So those three patterns, if you do all three of them, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=883.98s)]
*  if you constantly look at what's missing, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=886.98s)]
*  it's hard to ever stay fulfilled or happy. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=889.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=891.78s)]
*  So you have to always do something [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=892.62s)]
*  to try to make yourself happy [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=893.46s)]
*  because you're always noticing what's missing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=894.38s)]
*  That's just where your focus goes. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=896.18s)]
*  There's always something missing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=897.46s)]
*  There's always something that's not missing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=898.38s)]
*  There's always something beautiful. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=899.7s)]
*  You focus on what you have. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  You're gonna be more fulfilled. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=902.62s)]
*  Second one, if you focus on what you can control, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=903.9399999999999s)]
*  what you do, it's why you have your own business, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=906.26s)]
*  it's why who you are. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=907.9s)]
*  A lot of people focus on what they can't control. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=909.1s)]
*  It's overwhelming. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=911.1s)]
*  They're stressed out. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=912.02s)]
*  They think of all those things. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=912.86s)]
*  So if you constantly focus on what's missing, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=913.82s)]
*  you can't control, and the past, which you can't change, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=915.26s)]
*  what that makes is either angry or sad [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=919.1s)]
*  or frustrated or depressed. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=921.14s)]
*  You see people all the time that come to me, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=922.86s)]
*  groups, I just did this thing for Stanford [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=924.78s)]
*  where they, two years ago when everybody's in COVID, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=926.5s)]
*  they came in because two of their professors [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=928.94s)]
*  came to my seminar for five days. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=930.58s)]
*  Both were clinically depressed. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=932.34s)]
*  They came back with no depression symptoms. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=934.54s)]
*  They said, how do you do this? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=937.02s)]
*  I mean, do you have any data? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=939.0600000000001s)]
*  I said, well, I got millions of people [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=940.38s)]
*  that did my programs. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=942.22s)]
*  They go, no, like scientific data. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=943.7s)]
*  I said, well, you wanna do a test? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=944.86s)]
*  They said, sure. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=945.98s)]
*  I said, what do you wanna test on? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=946.9s)]
*  And they said, depression. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=947.94s)]
*  And I said, well, I already know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=949.26s)]
*  what triggers that for anybody. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=950.38s)]
*  You can give them drugs all day long. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=951.9s)]
*  All Prozac and Zoloft does is numb things. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=953.58s)]
*  But I said- [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=955.78s)]
*  Yeah, I just got off of mine. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=956.62s)]
*  Oh, good for you. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=957.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like 17 days off right now, so. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=958.3000000000001s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=959.86s)]
*  Well, let's see how it goes. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=960.7s)]
*  Let's see how it goes. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=961.54s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=963.14s)]
*  But your two patterns that you just did, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=964.38s)]
*  constantly focus what's missing and the past, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=966.26s)]
*  will make it a little harder for you [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=968.98s)]
*  to be happy on a long-term basis. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=971.14s)]
*  You crack yourself up, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=973.94s)]
*  so in the moments you change your state. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=974.82s)]
*  But if you wanted a long-term change, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=976.7s)]
*  all you'd have to do is change the habits, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=978.3000000000001s)]
*  just the habit of focusing on what you do have. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=979.94s)]
*  Like your life is magnificent. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=983.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I try a lot. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=984.7s)]
*  I just have to make sure I do. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=986.2600000000001s)]
*  Well, it has to get conditioned. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=987.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=988.86s)]
*  And then the second one, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=989.7s)]
*  so you don't have to think about it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=990.5400000000001s)]
*  If you don't think about it, it doesn't work, right? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=991.3800000000001s)]
*  Because by that time, it's too late. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=992.7s)]
*  And then the second one is focusing [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=993.98s)]
*  on what you can control what you already do, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=995.7s)]
*  but the past versus the present and the future, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=997.1s)]
*  enjoying the present and building the future. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1000.7s)]
*  Just that little pattern changed somebody's life. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1002.58s)]
*  You know how many people are on Prozac and Zoloft? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1005.3000000000001s)]
*  I'll ask in an audience, I got 15, 20,000 people. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1006.98s)]
*  I say, how many of you know someone [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1009.3399999999999s)]
*  who's on antidepressants and they're still depressed? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1010.9799999999999s)]
*  And 95% of the room raises their hand. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1013.7399999999999s)]
*  And the reason is because those drugs numb you, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1015.8199999999999s)]
*  but they don't charge the cause. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1017.8199999999999s)]
*  As long as you constantly focus on what's missing [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1019.14s)]
*  from my life and constantly look at the past, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1020.9s)]
*  which you can't control. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1023.06s)]
*  And if you're on top of it, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1024.26s)]
*  you're focused on what you can't control. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1025.26s)]
*  That's why I got off. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1027.3799999999999s)]
*  Because I couldn't have any feelings. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1028.22s)]
*  I was trying to be in relationships and stuff. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1029.54s)]
*  And it's like, girls would be like, do you like me? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1031.98s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't, you know? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1034.4199999999998s)]
*  Like, I would literally have to look [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1036.22s)]
*  at history of stuff. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1040.14s)]
*  It's almost like I would have to look at my own past [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1040.98s)]
*  for clues, right? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1043.18s)]
*  Like on how I felt and so. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1044.5800000000002s)]
*  Because you're being altered, right? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1046.6200000000001s)]
*  You're being altered and not a good person. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1048.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was too hard to get a real feeling out of myself. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1048.94s)]
*  And so I was like, man, I gotta have some feelings [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1051.7800000000002s)]
*  or I'm not gonna be able to make some choices for myself. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1053.6200000000001s)]
*  Good for you, that's really awesome. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1055.5400000000002s)]
*  But I want you to know how a normal treatment [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1057.1000000000001s)]
*  is to put you on antidepressants and therapy, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1060.14s)]
*  or one or the other or both, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1063.0600000000002s)]
*  So I asked the guys at Stanford, I said, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1064.8200000000002s)]
*  you wanna study it? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1066.46s)]
*  Well, one of the meta studies, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1067.3000000000002s)]
*  when you have multiple studies, they give you the averages. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1068.74s)]
*  And they said, well, the meta studies show [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1071.1799999999998s)]
*  that 60% of the people who take antidepressants [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1072.46s)]
*  and now they know SSRIs don't even work. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1075.62s)]
*  There was a whole cover of Newsweek. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1078.02s)]
*  A year ago in September. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1079.86s)]
*  Did you not know this? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1081.54s)]
*  You think nobody emailed me. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1082.3799999999999s)]
*  I've been taking it for 17 years. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1083.22s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1085.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1086.74s)]
*  I don't get an email? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1087.58s)]
*  Go look at September of 2022, cover of Newsweek, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1088.4199999999998s)]
*  says meta studies show the SSRIs don't work, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1091.3s)]
*  but we keep selling them, right? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1093.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, then what am I doing? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1095.1799999999998s)]
*  But watch this, here's the stats. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1096.6599999999999s)]
*  60% don't improve at all. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1097.94s)]
*  40% of people improve. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1100.14s)]
*  The average improvement, according to meta studies, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  is 50%, so they're half as depressed as they were. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1103.5800000000002s)]
*  Now, some people get well, but it's a very small percentage. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1106.14s)]
*  So I said, you could almost do that with a placebo. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1108.6200000000001s)]
*  And the guy laughed and said, yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1110.54s)]
*  I said, well, what's the best study you've ever done? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1112.02s)]
*  The most effective study in science. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1113.8200000000002s)]
*  They said there was a study done at Johns Hopkins [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1115.8200000000002s)]
*  about five and a half years ago. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1117.8600000000001s)]
*  And who is it? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1119.22s)]
*  Pardon me? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1120.06s)]
*  And who, what is it? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1120.9s)]
*  This is from Stanford. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1121.74s)]
*  Who's Johns Hopkins? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1122.5800000000002s)]
*  Johns Hopkins Hospital has some of the best researchers [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1123.94s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1126.8200000000002s)]
*  And so they did this study, and here's what they did. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1128.3400000000001s)]
*  They give people psilocybin for a month, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1130.5800000000002s)]
*  magic mushrooms, and cognitive therapy. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1132.98s)]
*  I said, well, you ought to get some change out of that. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1135.9s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1137.94s)]
*  It was the greatest change they've ever seen [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1138.78s)]
*  in the history of psychiatry. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1140.6200000000001s)]
*  Six weeks after treatment, 53%, excuse me, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1141.8200000000002s)]
*  54% of the people had no symptoms of depression. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1145.1000000000001s)]
*  I take four stems and a diet Coke. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1147.7s)]
*  I'll talk to my sister for an hour. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1149.8600000000001s)]
*  You know? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1151.46s)]
*  So I fully support that, sir. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1152.3000000000002s)]
*  But unfortunately. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1156.78s)]
*  So you're saying there's new methods. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1157.62s)]
*  There's new methods. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1159.78s)]
*  But I said, okay, that's amazing. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1160.62s)]
*  But I said, I think we'll do better, but let's see. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1162.58s)]
*  So they did a group. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1164.66s)]
*  They modeled that same drug study. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1166.06s)]
*  Did the same thing with me with no drugs. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1168.1399999999999s)]
*  I put people in this six day seminar I have [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1169.62s)]
*  called Date with Destiny. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1171.58s)]
*  And they picked all the people [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1172.94s)]
*  and put them all. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1173.94s)]
*  That's your annual seminar, right? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1174.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the ones here. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1175.82s)]
*  And what was amazing was the results were so profound [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1177.18s)]
*  that they didn't want to get canceled. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1180.1399999999999s)]
*  So they sent the data blind [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1181.42s)]
*  after three other organizations before they published it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1182.94s)]
*  And they published in the journal Psychiatry last year. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1185.06s)]
*  Results, six weeks later with no drugs, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1187.1s)]
*  just six days of rewiring your brain. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1190.5s)]
*  100% of the people, no depression whatsoever. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1192.58s)]
*  Even better, 17% of the people had suicidal ideation. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1195.22s)]
*  No suicidal ideation. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1198.54s)]
*  Here's the best part. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1199.7s)]
*  11 months later, they followed up. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1200.98s)]
*  72% reduction in negative emotions, still no depression. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1203.18s)]
*  52% improvement in positive emotions. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1206.7s)]
*  So when you make a shift in the way you use your brain [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1209.9s)]
*  and it gets conditioned, and it does get conditioned. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1213.42s)]
*  So they were studying how it works. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1216.2600000000002s)]
*  And so there's a biochemical change [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1218.2600000000002s)]
*  that actually happens in the body. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1219.8200000000002s)]
*  It's a perspective, that's the thing. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1220.66s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you gotta change like, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1221.94s)]
*  yeah, instead of just being like, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1224.42s)]
*  I wanna have this New Year's resolution, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1225.2600000000002s)]
*  another rule for myself, I need to change the ruler. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1226.6200000000001s)]
*  That's good, you got it, you got it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1229.8200000000002s)]
*  It's like, I need to, that's what I need to change. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1230.66s)]
*  But a lot of people, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1232.74s)]
*  sometimes we don't even see that we're the ruler. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1233.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great metaphor. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1235.42s)]
*  This episode is sponsored by PrizePix. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1237.8600000000001s)]

*  NBA, NFL, UFC, and more. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1254.34s)]
*  Instead of choosing teams, you choose individual players. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1260.98s)]
*  That's what I like about PrizePix, it's novel. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1264.5s)]

*  That's a great metaphor. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1375.98s)]
*  You know, like if you wanted to go to a, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1376.82s)]
*  I don't know if you're into racing at all, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1378.9399999999998s)]
*  but like a Le Mans, a 24 hour race, or a Baja 1000, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1380.06s)]
*  you could have an amazing car, a Ferrari, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1383.86s)]
*  it's not gonna last. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1386.6599999999999s)]
*  You have to re-engineer that car [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1387.9399999999998s)]
*  to be able to take on the desert or drive for 24 hours [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1389.7399999999998s)]
*  or go to the ones that are in the desert there [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1393.1399999999999s)]
*  where they have a pipe so that when you go down, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1394.82s)]
*  it's still gonna get the air to the combustion of the engine. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1396.6599999999999s)]
*  We have to re-engineer ourselves so the time's right. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1398.9799999999998s)]
*  We're in a time right now, it feels like winter, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1401.62s)]
*  where there's more fear than usual. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1403.8999999999999s)]
*  It's a season, it'll pass. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1405.78s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1407.1399999999999s)]
*  I know it's true, you study history. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1408.3s)]
*  Think of it this way, there's patterns. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1410.5s)]
*  Because we see a lot of stuff, right? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1413.02s)]
*  Like there's so much things going on, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1414.6599999999999s)]
*  it's like there's all kinds, yeah, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1416.0s)]
*  it feels like that's true. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1418.2s)]
*  Well, it's because it's constantly fed to you [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1419.84s)]
*  by the media. Right, it's hard for me to know [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1421.8s)]
*  if it's true or if it's just so much. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1422.84s)]
*  Well, it may be true, but it's disproportionate. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1424.72s)]
*  It's like you didn't know 30 years ago [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1426.96s)]
*  there was an aircraft crash in some third world country, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1429.52s)]
*  but now you know it in 10 seconds in your pocket. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1433.84s)]
*  So you know when people overreact to something, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1436.12s)]
*  you've ever gotten pissed off over something little, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1438.72s)]
*  the reason you overreact is it's not that moment, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1441.16s)]
*  it's that it happened again. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1443.92s)]
*  Somebody did it again, right? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1446.4s)]
*  So I call that stacking. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1447.52s)]
*  So when you stack problem on problem on problem, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1449.3600000000001s)]
*  pretty soon your whole biochemistry, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1451.84s)]
*  it's hard to get back. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1453.76s)]
*  But you can also stack the good, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1455.28s)]
*  that's why I do the morning priming. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1457.08s)]
*  So when you stack a good thing on top of a good thing [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1458.8s)]
*  on top of a good thing, your whole biochemistry changes [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1460.72s)]
*  and now you see the world through different eyes. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1463.28s)]
*  It's not like you're guaranteed to succeed, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1465.6000000000001s)]
*  but your probabilities of pulling it off [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1467.68s)]
*  and enjoying yourself are up about 1,000 fold. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1469.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, and I go to AA meetings, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1471.96s)]
*  I go to recovery meetings, right? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1474.16s)]
*  And I notice if I go to a couple in a day, dude, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1476.16s)]
*  by Friday I'm a fucking good guy. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1478.76s)]
*  You know, I'm like hugging people, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1481.28s)]
*  I'm like telling blind people I'm gonna heal them, I can't. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1484.8400000000001s)]
*  And I'll do this for like 30 seconds on them, you know? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1488.64s)]
*  It's like, you just feel like, but you're right, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1490.6000000000001s)]
*  but it takes me, I have to stack them up [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1493.28s)]
*  and it's like, and then it's usually a couple days later [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1495.2s)]
*  that I even, I'm like, man, why do I feel so great? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1497.92s)]
*  It's like, oh, because I did this work [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1500.0800000000002s)]
*  over the past 10 days, you know? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1501.96s)]
*  And what you did there were actually, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1503.52s)]
*  when you really do it strongly like that, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1505.56s)]
*  it creates a biochemical change [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  and that creates a new habit in your nervous system. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1509.36s)]
*  So what notices that in your body? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1512.0s)]
*  Like your chemistry in your body actually notices [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1513.68s)]
*  you're doing something different? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1516.48s)]
*  And wants to, like. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1517.76s)]
*  Here's what they found. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1518.6s)]
*  They did my work with a top professor [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  who was highly rated at Stanford. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1522.68s)]
*  He did my work word for word, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1524.6s)]
*  but he didn't do what I do in an event, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1526.92s)]
*  which is change your biochemistry, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1528.16s)]
*  change the way you move, your breathe, your voice. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1529.6399999999999s)]
*  All those things change you. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1531.56s)]
*  He didn't do that, he just taught it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1532.88s)]
*  He got unbelievable results. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1534.48s)]
*  He's a tremendous teacher and professor. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1535.7600000000002s)]
*  But mine were 300% greater [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1538.3200000000002s)]
*  because of the biochemical change. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1540.2800000000002s)]
*  So they followed me for three years. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1541.68s)]
*  They had me wear the $68,000 device [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  that measures heart rate variability. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1545.4s)]
*  They'd come during every break and take my saliva. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1547.2s)]
*  They took my blood, do my blood pressure. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1549.24s)]
*  Just. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1551.3200000000002s)]
*  It was crazy, but they did it on several events [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1552.16s)]
*  over three years and they found all these wild things. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1555.5200000000002s)]
*  And is this Stanford did it? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1558.2s)]
*  Yeah, Stanford did it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1559.3600000000001s)]
*  And what they found was, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1560.2s)]
*  and it's the same group of Stanford [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1561.0400000000002s)]
*  in partnership with a group that's worked with Tom Brady [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1562.08s)]
*  and some of the greatest athletes. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1564.1599999999999s)]
*  And they have this thing they call [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1565.56s)]
*  the Championship Biochemistry. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1567.0s)]
*  And so if Tom Brady is down in the fourth quarter [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1570.1599999999999s)]
*  by 10 points in the Super Bowl, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1572.56s)]
*  how's that guy come back and win? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1574.6399999999999s)]
*  The reason is because there's a part of him [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1576.3999999999999s)]
*  that goes in this state, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1578.6799999999998s)]
*  and I do it every time I get on stage, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  but my audience does it as well. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1581.3999999999999s)]
*  And they measure it. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1582.9199999999998s)]
*  So what happens is testosterone explodes through my body. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1583.8s)]
*  That gives you incredible drive and push. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1586.9199999999998s)]
*  And I've got to keep this building going. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1589.08s)]
*  Imagine 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1590.8s)]
*  I got to reach the guy at the back for 12 straight hours. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1594.6s)]
*  The level of intensity is amazing, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1596.8s)]
*  playfulness fun, but it's still intensity. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  But normally that has a lot of stress with it. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1601.1599999999999s)]
*  My cortisol, which is the stress hormone, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1603.3999999999999s)]
*  drops through the floor, same as Tom. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1605.8s)]
*  So what you get is total drive. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1607.48s)]
*  It doesn't guarantee success, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1609.2s)]
*  but total drive and not a lot of stress. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1610.28s)]
*  So you're able to stay centered and go. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1613.0s)]
*  So my audience though, this amazing thing, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1615.0s)]
*  so they measured me. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1616.9199999999998s)]
*  They found that I jump a thousand times in a day [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1617.76s)]
*  on stage and I weigh 290 pounds. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1621.64s)]
*  So every time I jump and come down, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  it's four times your body weight. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1624.28s)]
*  So imagine a thousand pounds of pressure, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1625.48s)]
*  a thousand times in a day. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1627.64s)]
*  So my bone density is, you look at it, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1629.44s)]
*  I look like a gorilla underneath it. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  Cause I've done it for like 40 years, right? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1632.56s)]
*  So on the other hand, they also saw that, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1635.68s)]
*  if you're running with somebody [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1638.6000000000001s)]
*  and you can't talk any longer, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  you've gotten to a four of lactic acid. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1641.08s)]
*  I'm in an 18 and still speaking. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1643.1200000000001s)]
*  So then they started testing my audiences [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1645.08s)]
*  and they saw it looks like music. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1647.6000000000001s)]
*  When I go into these States, the audience follows me [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1648.88s)]
*  and they measured it then when COVID happened, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1653.0800000000002s)]
*  I had all people at home. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1654.88s)]
*  And so we had people in 195 countries. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1656.48s)]
*  So they went to people in 40 countries [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1658.72s)]
*  and measured them in real time as we're doing this. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1660.5200000000002s)]
*  Now imagine, and it lights up. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  They're measuring them over this. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1663.88s)]
*  I built this, what happened was. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1665.88s)]
*  Not zoom, but like a larger scale zoom. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1667.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, 20 foot high LED screens, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1669.4s)]
*  0.67 highest resolution. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1671.2s)]
*  I built the piece so I can bring people up. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1673.1200000000001s)]
*  Eric, you know, I'm from zoom. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1675.3200000000002s)]
*  He built the system. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1676.2800000000002s)]
*  So instead of a thousand people, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  I could do 25,000. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1678.6399999999999s)]
*  I've done a million and a half people in one seminar [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1679.48s)]
*  to give you an idea for four days. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1681.52s)]
*  It's been wild. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1683.0s)]
*  So, but when I built this, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1683.96s)]
*  I wanted to figure out how to help people. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1685.76s)]
*  And it's like, could it really work through these screens? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1686.8799999999999s)]
*  It was just out of necessity [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  because every stadium was closed. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1689.96s)]
*  The governor of California calls me and says, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1691.48s)]
*  March of 2020, we're about to have an event [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1693.24s)]
*  for 12,500 people. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1695.44s)]
*  And he goes, you can only put a hundred people [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1696.76s)]
*  in the stadium. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1698.44s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1699.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1700.72s)]
*  It's not gonna work. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1701.56s)]
*  So I was like, screw you, we'll move to Vegas. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1702.3999999999999s)]
*  They'll never shut down Vegas. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1703.96s)]
*  They shut down Vegas like 10 days [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1705.08s)]
*  before we moved 12,500 people there. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1706.72s)]
*  Then I went, we'll go to Texas. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1708.8s)]
*  The governor there told me he'll never then. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1710.04s)]
*  He bet, right? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1712.24s)]
*  Yeah, we'll do it in Joe Rogan's yard. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1713.3600000000001s)]
*  We did it in movie theaters for 10 people. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1715.2s)]
*  And we did 1250 movie theaters. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  They shut down the movie theaters. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1719.8s)]
*  So I built the studio. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1721.16s)]
*  So they came and measured the people [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1722.56s)]
*  in all these different countries. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1724.1200000000001s)]
*  And what's wild is like, we start here at 10 a.m. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1725.8s)]
*  for like a four day seminar. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1728.32s)]
*  And I had like, I just did one for 14,000 people. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1729.88s)]
*  And we had about a couple thousand people from Australia. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1733.0s)]
*  We're starting at 10 a.m. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1735.76s)]
*  It's midnight for them. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1737.64s)]
*  I go 12 to 13 hours. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1738.48s)]
*  So they go from midnight to one in the afternoon [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1739.3200000000002s)]
*  for four straight days and nights. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1742.04s)]
*  And we lost 1% of the people. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1743.64s)]
*  Good day, good night. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1745.04s)]
*  So they have, but their biochemistry [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1745.96s)]
*  is changing the same as mine. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1748.0s)]
*  And so that's why a year later, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1749.48s)]
*  the changes are still there [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1751.3200000000002s)]
*  without them ever interacting with me again. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1753.0s)]
*  Cause people, well, will this last? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1754.44s)]
*  Well, that's why Stanford did the study. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1755.5600000000002s)]
*  So that's what the study is. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1756.76s)]
*  So you're saying, so when the study [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1757.76s)]
*  you were talking about a little bit ago, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1759.28s)]
*  that was, they went back to people [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1760.3200000000002s)]
*  that had gone to your seminar. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1761.96s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1763.92s)]
*  And they measured them. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1765.72s)]
*  And a year later, you said 50 something percent [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1766.56s)]
*  of them still had? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1769.52s)]
*  No, it's a reduction of 72% negative emotions, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1770.8s)]
*  increase of positive emotions, 52%. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1773.32s)]
*  But now, you know, people since COVID, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1775.24s)]
*  we've got so used to being home. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1778.4s)]
*  People are like, why should I have to go to work? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1779.44s)]
*  I don't want to drive to work. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1780.64s)]
*  And people, offices want people to come to work. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1781.76s)]
*  There's all these conflicts. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1783.96s)]
*  And there's a lot more people being able to work at home. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1784.96s)]
*  But now if you read the studies, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1786.96s)]
*  people are more unhappy now [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1788.24s)]
*  than they were at the peak of COVID. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1790.4s)]
*  Because they wanted to be at home, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1792.48s)]
*  but now they feel isolated. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1794.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1795.24s)]
*  And so what they don't understand is [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1796.08s)]
*  the path of least resistance never makes you happy. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1798.24s)]
*  It's like, you have to push yourself. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1801.3999999999999s)]
*  When people talk about self-esteem, I hate this term. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  Like so many kids were taught [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1806.32s)]
*  to get a participation trophy for something. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1807.72s)]
*  And they thought, I'm going to build [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1810.1999999999998s)]
*  their self-esteem this way. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1811.32s)]
*  People can tell you your whole life, you're a piece of crap. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1812.72s)]
*  And your brain goes, screw you, I'll show you. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1815.0s)]
*  And you become somebody. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1817.3999999999999s)]
*  People your whole life can tell you you're beautiful, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1818.56s)]
*  you're perfect, you're the best. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1820.1999999999998s)]
*  And you can still not believe them and be depressed. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1822.08s)]
*  And you can still think about your life [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1825.0s)]
*  and think you're nobody. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1826.32s)]
*  Your life self-esteem, your self-esteem, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1827.44s)]
*  esteem for yourself is earned by you [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1829.72s)]
*  doing something difficult for you. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1832.3999999999999s)]
*  When you do something that's incredibly hard [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1834.24s)]
*  and you push through it, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1835.84s)]
*  your brain starts to have inner pride, not fake ego pride. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1836.8s)]
*  Right, so you're saying none of that other, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1840.28s)]
*  so that outside of stuff doesn't really matter. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1841.56s)]
*  Your self-esteem is truly based [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1843.72s)]
*  on your relationship with yourself? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1845.2s)]
*  Yes, and your ability to grow. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1847.28s)]
*  I mean, what makes people happy? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1848.72s)]
*  Progress. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1850.12s)]
*  If you get some big goal, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1851.28s)]
*  there's one of two responses when you achieve the goal. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1853.24s)]
*  The horrible one is, is this all there is? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1855.6s)]
*  Which a lot of people do after fighting for a goal [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1857.9199999999998s)]
*  and this is all there is. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1860.8799999999999s)]
*  But the other one is, let's say, oh this is amazing. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1861.8799999999999s)]
*  How long does that amazing feeling [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1864.36s)]
*  of achieving your goal last? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1865.9599999999998s)]
*  Six years? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1867.24s)]
*  A year? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1868.6s)]
*  Six months? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1869.4399999999998s)]
*  Six days? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1870.9599999999998s)]
*  Six hours? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1871.8s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1872.62s)]
*  For me, it doesn't last really long. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1875.24s)]
*  I don't feel that kind of stuff very much. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  Also you'd be numb by those drugs, right? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1879.6399999999999s)]
*  But for most people, it's somewhere between six hours [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1881.6s)]
*  and probably six weeks. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1883.76s)]
*  Right, so not super long. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1884.84s)]
*  No, and so the purpose of life [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1886.0s)]
*  is not just to get your goals. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1887.96s)]
*  Your goals or your getting what you want [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1889.6s)]
*  doesn't make you happy. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1891.8s)]
*  What makes you happy is who you become [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1892.6399999999999s)]
*  in pursuit of those goals. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1893.84s)]
*  So the growth, the progress, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1895.26s)]
*  even if you don't achieve it yet, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1896.9199999999998s)]
*  but you start losing weight or you start building muscle [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1898.12s)]
*  or you start making your relationship better [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1900.04s)]
*  or you start to build a business, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1901.52s)]
*  the building, the progress is what makes you feel alive [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1903.52s)]
*  because we're all made to either grow or die. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1906.3999999999999s)]
*  If your relationship's not growing, it's dying. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1908.44s)]
*  If your business is not growing, it's dying. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1910.12s)]
*  There's no in-between bullshit. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1911.7199999999998s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1913.12s)]
*  And when you grow, you have something to give. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1914.28s)]
*  And what makes people fulfilled is growing and giving, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1916.84s)]
*  sharing it with somebody [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1920.1999999999998s)]
*  because there's only so much joy you can have by yourself. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1921.08s)]
*  Drugs, alcohol, entertainment, sex with yourself, whatever. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1923.56s)]
*  By yourself, there's a limit to what you can feel. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1927.1599999999999s)]
*  That's why whenever something great happens, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1929.4799999999998s)]
*  most of us want to tell someone, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1931.56s)]
*  share it with somebody we love [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1933.0s)]
*  because when you share it, it magnifies it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  So that's really what we're trying to show people [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1936.84s)]
*  is how to create that kind of progress. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1938.84s)]
*  And a problem in New Year's is, as you said, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1940.9199999999998s)]
*  a resolution is just like, what do I want? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1943.52s)]
*  And they don't think about it in any depth. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1945.56s)]
*  They say it and then here's the problem. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1947.4399999999998s)]
*  They don't take it beyond that. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1949.1599999999999s)]
*  They have no plan, right? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1950.48s)]
*  Or it's a very simple plan. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1952.1599999999999s)]
*  And by February 1, by the 1st of February, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1953.72s)]
*  95% of those things are already broken. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1955.8799999999999s)]
*  But what they're really missing is there's like- [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1958.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, I quit my New Year's resolution in December. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1958.8799999999999s)]
*  You know? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1961.28s)]
*  Well, you need a path. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1962.8s)]
*  And so if you want to make your relationship better, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1964.0s)]
*  your business better, your life better, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1965.6799999999998s)]
*  it starts with knowing what you want. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1967.56s)]
*  You gotta say, what do I want? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1969.68s)]
*  Why do I want it? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1970.52s)]
*  And what kind of person would I have to be [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1971.36s)]
*  to have that stay? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1972.2s)]
*  And then you got a second step where you gotta tell yourself, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1973.84s)]
*  find and tell yourself the truth, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1975.92s)]
*  which is there's a gap between where I am [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1977.68s)]
*  and where I want to be. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1980.52s)]
*  And don't bullshit yourself. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1981.36s)]
*  Don't go, I'm a little overweight [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1982.28s)]
*  or I'm fat because I'm big boned. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1984.36s)]
*  No, you're fat because you have poor habits, right? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1986.48s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1988.84s)]
*  Yeah, some people, yeah, I remember this. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1989.68s)]
*  People always like, he'll grow out of it. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1991.28s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, he's 34. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1993.0s)]
*  Like my buddy's grandma's like, it's just baby fat. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1994.84s)]
*  He'll grow out of it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1997.52s)]
*  We all have different, but it's like, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=1999.4s)]
*  he ain't fucking, Ronnie ain't growing out of it. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2000.68s)]
*  The reason you don't grow out of it [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2003.28s)]
*  is you have to see what's causing you to have that gap. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2004.24s)]
*  And it's one of only a couple things. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2006.8799999999999s)]
*  Either you got fear, so you're not taking action, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2008.52s)]
*  or you might have, for example, some limiting beliefs [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2011.12s)]
*  like it never works, I've tried everything, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2014.2s)]
*  the good ones are gone, so you don't even begin. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2016.08s)]
*  Or you might have some emotion gets in the way [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2018.6s)]
*  or a bad habit, or maybe just missing the skill. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2020.4s)]
*  No one's ever taught you how to make money [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2024.04s)]
*  or grow a business or have a great relationship. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2025.96s)]
*  So you're learning on the job [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2029.12s)]
*  and it's painful to learn the job. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2030.4399999999998s)]
*  So I've always said, find somebody who's extraordinary [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2031.9199999999998s)]
*  at something or many people, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2034.6799999999998s)]
*  figure out what they're doing and do that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2036.6799999999998s)]
*  It's called modeling. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2038.6s)]
*  Instead of reinventing the wheel. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2039.4399999999998s)]
*  Now you're going to add yourself to it. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2040.6799999999998s)]
*  But modeling gives you the pathway to power. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2042.3999999999999s)]
*  And then once you know what you want, why you want it, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2044.8s)]
*  you're honest about the gap, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2047.48s)]
*  you come up with a quick plan, not a perfect one, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2048.7999999999997s)]
*  and you start taking action. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2050.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you face your demons, you slay your dragons. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2051.7999999999997s)]
*  What needs to change? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2054.4s)]
*  Like, okay, I'm never going to have a relationship [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2055.36s)]
*  with a man who's going to be a great man all the time. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2057.52s)]
*  So I got to change this. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2059.36s)]
*  It's hard, but I'm going to do the hard thing. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2060.2s)]
*  And when you do the hard thing, you get momentum. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2062.16s)]
*  And then what was hard becomes easy after a while. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2064.28s)]
*  And that's really the secret. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2066.68s)]
*  Dang. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2068.44s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2069.68s)]
*  I'm going to need to calculate it even go through that again. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2070.84s)]
*  But that's okay. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2072.72s)]
*  But it's a lot of great information. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2076.6s)]
*  I talk rabbley because I'm so passionate, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2078.84s)]
*  but you take people through it, an event where they get [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2080.2400000000002s)]
*  to process it and take time through it to give you sense. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2082.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, I appreciate it, man. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2084.52s)]
*  I feel like it's nice you to share that stuff with us [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2086.08s)]
*  because I know it's stuff that you learned over the years. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2088.12s)]
*  And you know, and it's a lot of value in that. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2089.84s)]
*  And that you even taking that time to just share [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2092.2s)]
*  that kind of stuff with us. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2093.8s)]
*  And I know you guys have a program. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2094.96s)]
*  It's not the date with Destiny, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2098.4s)]
*  but you guys have another program that you guys do. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2100.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, that program started with COVID [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2102.92s)]
*  because when all the whole world shut down, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2105.4s)]
*  I was like, people need this right now. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2107.48s)]
*  How do I help? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2109.12s)]
*  So I built that studio I told you about. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2110.2s)]
*  And I was like, okay, why don't I do, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2111.7599999999998s)]
*  well, you don't have travel because they can't. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2114.08s)]
*  Why don't I make it so there's no money involved [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2116.3199999999997s)]
*  and let's just serve as many people as we can. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2117.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I put together this three day immersion [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2119.9199999999996s)]
*  of just three hours a day, not 12. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2122.52s)]
*  And I said, let's give people an experience [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2124.72s)]
*  where they can really transform. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2126.64s)]
*  The first year we had a half a million people do it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2127.68s)]
*  Last year we had a million and a half people. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2129.48s)]
*  So we're doing one more this year. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2131.44s)]
*  All at the same time? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2133.48s)]
*  All at the same time. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2134.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2135.52s)]
*  In 195 countries, every country in the world. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2136.3599999999997s)]
*  So fantastic. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2137.8799999999997s)]
*  So we're doing one this year, January 25th through the 27th. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2138.96s)]
*  It's absolutely free. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2141.8399999999997s)]
*  There's no charge, not partially free. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  And all the people have to do is they go to, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2145.16s)]
*  it's called Time to Rise. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2146.7599999999998s)]
*  It's time to change your life. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2148.24s)]
*  Oh, I see it right here, timetorise.com. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2149.08s)]
*  January 25th through 27th and it's free. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2151.6s)]
*  It's free for anybody who wants to go [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2153.72s)]
*  and they can bring their friends or family. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2154.8399999999997s)]
*  They can do it from their house. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2155.88s)]
*  They don't have to travel. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2156.72s)]
*  They can go to the office and do it with people around them. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2157.56s)]
*  So it's really amazing the results. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2159.3599999999997s)]
*  We have had people change their business, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2161.2799999999997s)]
*  change their relationship, get off drugs. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2163.08s)]
*  I'll tell you one fun example though. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2164.7599999999998s)]
*  Two years ago, there was this guy that was 735 pounds. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2166.4s)]
*  He never would have made it to a seminar. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2170.3599999999997s)]
*  He saw it was free. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2172.0s)]
*  He's been in bed. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2173.04s)]
*  His brother died. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2174.12s)]
*  He got addicted to painkillers. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2174.96s)]
*  And then his body just blew up. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2176.56s)]
*  And then they told him he had to be on an oxygen mask [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2179.68s)]
*  the rest of his life. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2182.08s)]
*  He couldn't get out of bed. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2182.92s)]
*  Like a CPAP machine, you mean? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2183.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, it wasn't CPAP. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2184.7599999999998s)]
*  It's pure ongoing oxygen. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2185.92s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2187.56s)]
*  And then secondly, he couldn't get out of bed [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2188.4s)]
*  to go to the bathroom. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2190.16s)]
*  He had to be in bed. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2191.0s)]
*  He was naked in bed for five years and 730 pounds. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2191.8399999999997s)]
*  So he watches. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2195.4s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2196.68s)]
*  I brought him up on screen. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2197.52s)]
*  I didn't know he was there. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2198.3399999999997s)]
*  He raised his hand digitally. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2199.18s)]
*  So I raised it up and started asking questions. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2200.0s)]
*  So he got so inspired by this. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2202.6s)]
*  He took this little like clothes hanger bar [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2205.12s)]
*  and just started doing these little exercises. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2207.48s)]
*  And over 90 days, I told him, I said, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2209.92s)]
*  you get out of bed and make it to the restroom. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2212.3199999999997s)]
*  You get out of the restroom and drive a car again, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2214.3199999999997s)]
*  which I hadn't done in seven years. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2216.48s)]
*  I hadn't been in seven years. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2217.52s)]
*  And I said, I'll fly you to my Unleash the Power [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2218.8399999999997s)]
*  Within event for four days. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  You walk on fire with me and you'll really shift [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2221.92s)]
*  your life, right? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2223.7999999999997s)]
*  He's lost 320 pounds. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2225.12s)]
*  He, three months later, was out of the bed [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2227.72s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2230.58s)]
*  He drove a car. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2231.52s)]
*  He fell in love with this girl. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2233.2000000000003s)]
*  He came to the event, walked on fire. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2234.04s)]
*  And now he's like, we have a network of people [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2235.7200000000003s)]
*  because once you come to this event, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2237.64s)]
*  there's people all over the world you become friends with. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2238.6800000000003s)]
*  And he's like the superstar of all these people [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2240.8s)]
*  because they can't believe the changes he's made. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2242.7200000000003s)]
*  And it all happened because he never would have come [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2244.88s)]
*  to an event, but because he could do it from home, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2246.36s)]
*  in his bed, he could do that. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2248.76s)]
*  It could reach him. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2250.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2251.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2252.1s)]
*  What's something like, I noticed like there's been times [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2252.94s)]
*  in my past where it's like, I think I didn't want to change [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2254.98s)]
*  because I wanted to keep having an excuse, right? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2258.52s)]
*  Like I remember even with smoking, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2261.0s)]
*  I remember it was like, part of me didn't want to stop. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2262.88s)]
*  There was a part of me, I realized I didn't want [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2266.4s)]
*  to stop smoking because I knew if I stopped, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2268.08s)]
*  I wouldn't, and it wasn't like a, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2271.76s)]
*  it was kind of a subconscious part of me, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2273.88s)]
*  but I knew if I stopped, I wouldn't have something [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2276.12s)]
*  to blame my inefficiency on or my, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2278.88s)]
*  I just wouldn't have something to blame. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2283.52s)]
*  It's like, it gave me something to blame. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2284.8s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2287.28s)]
*  It does because everything we do, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2288.16s)]
*  even things that seem stupid or derogatory, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2290.48s)]
*  we do to meet some needs. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2292.76s)]
*  There's only six needs people have. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2294.56s)]
*  We have a need for comfort or certainty. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2295.88s)]
*  We have a need for variety. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2298.28s)]
*  We have a need to feel significant, unique, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2299.92s)]
*  special, important, everybody has that need. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2301.84s)]
*  We have a need to feel connection and love. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2303.64s)]
*  We have a need to grow. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2305.16s)]
*  We have a need to contribute beyond ourselves. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2306.0s)]
*  It was just comfort, I think. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2307.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2308.88s)]
*  It's the comfort and the certainty, what you know, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2309.7s)]
*  but there is a fear that everybody has, two fears. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2311.82s)]
*  All human beings at some moment feel [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2314.62s)]
*  that they're not enough, and to feel like you're not enough [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2316.56s)]
*  for someone who's loved you crave [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2319.12s)]
*  makes a person crazy inside. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2320.92s)]
*  Wait, for someone who's, why did I hear that right? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2322.3199999999997s)]
*  Somebody who's loved you crave. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2323.68s)]
*  The average person, you don't care, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2325.4s)]
*  but if it's somebody who's loved you really want. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2326.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2328.04s)]
*  So if you feel like you're not enough, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2328.88s)]
*  then you feel like you won't be loved. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2330.12s)]
*  To be worthless and unloved is like psychological death. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2332.04s)]
*  So people drug themselves, eat, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2335.6s)]
*  they do anything not to feel that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2336.92s)]
*  Well, what are your choices on changing that? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2338.56s)]
*  Well, you could take on a new project, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2340.68s)]
*  build a podcast, build a business, do something, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2342.3199999999997s)]
*  but you have to take risks to do that. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2344.3199999999997s)]
*  And risks, you could look like a failure. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2346.3199999999997s)]
*  You could fail, which might look like you're worthless, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2348.38s)]
*  might look like you're not worthy of love. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2350.6600000000003s)]
*  So subconsciously we come up with these ways to adapt. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2352.3s)]
*  So smoking a cigarette comforts you [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2355.3s)]
*  because when you take that big slow breath in [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2357.62s)]
*  and blow it out nice and slow, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2359.78s)]
*  it changes the tempo in your body completely. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2362.1s)]
*  You go from stress to comfort. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2364.42s)]
*  The wild west. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2366.02s)]
*  You can do that same shit without the cigarette. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2366.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2368.58s)]
*  But once you're addicted and it becomes the go-to. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2369.42s)]
*  Some people stop smoking and then they overeat. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2371.86s)]
*  Because overeating puts all the blood in your stomach [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2374.46s)]
*  and you start to breathe slowly again and feel things [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2376.92s)]
*  and you let go. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2379.88s)]
*  So you can get certainty and comfort by those ways [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2381.08s)]
*  or you can do it by working out [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2384.4s)]
*  and developing a sense of strength that makes you certain. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2386.04s)]
*  Or you can do the same thing day after day. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2389.04s)]
*  There's so many ways. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  There's positive ways and negative ways. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2391.56s)]
*  But we also need uncertainty. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2393.16s)]
*  We need variety. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2394.4s)]
*  If every day you know what's gonna happen, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2395.56s)]
*  how it's gonna happen, you get bored out of your mind. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2397.44s)]
*  But if you have so much variety, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2400.2400000000002s)]
*  you don't know what's gonna happen. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2401.36s)]
*  People freak out. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2402.1800000000003s)]
*  So these needs bounce up against each other. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2403.28s)]
*  And so when people do a behavior like smoking, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  smoking will give you comfort, certainty. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2407.7599999999998s)]
*  Smoking will give you, in some people's case, variety. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2410.3199999999997s)]
*  Because you were stressed out and now you change your state. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2412.9599999999996s)]
*  That feels different. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2415.48s)]
*  It's called variety. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2416.3199999999997s)]
*  Smoking will give you significance if you think it's cool. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2417.3999999999996s)]
*  Although today it's a little harder to do that [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2420.2799999999997s)]
*  because most people think you're an idiot [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2421.72s)]
*  and we put you in a separate room by yourself. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2423.08s)]
*  Yeah, they think you are. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2425.04s)]
*  But it used to be, I'm cool if I smoke. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2426.68s)]
*  And some people say, you can't make me not smoke. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2428.52s)]
*  I'm significant. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2430.3999999999996s)]
*  For some people, it's a way to connect [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2431.62s)]
*  with other people who smoke. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2432.7599999999998s)]
*  So when you meet one of those needs, you like it. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2434.32s)]
*  When you meet two, you're really like, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2438.4s)]
*  when you meet three, you get addicted. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2439.7200000000003s)]
*  And you get addicted to positive things, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2441.48s)]
*  you get addicted to exercise, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2443.1600000000003s)]
*  you get addicted to working out, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2444.32s)]
*  you get addicted to growing your business. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2445.5s)]
*  Everyone gets addicted to something. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2448.96s)]
*  If it meets a bunch of your needs, it's amazing. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2450.9s)]
*  And in a relationship, if a person is certain [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2453.1200000000003s)]
*  that you love them and there's always a surprise, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2456.92s)]
*  they say, oh, I know they love me [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2459.8s)]
*  and we have so many surprises, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2461.7000000000003s)]
*  we have so much variety in our life. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2463.6400000000003s)]
*  And I feel like the most important person significant [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2465.2000000000003s)]
*  and I feel so much love for them [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2467.6800000000003s)]
*  and we're growing, contributing, I'm leaving. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2468.84s)]
*  Nobody says that. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2471.32s)]
*  Because when your needs are met, people stay. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2472.6800000000003s)]
*  Whenever I work with couples, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2475.52s)]
*  I work with hundreds of thousands of couples [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2476.52s)]
*  over the years, and they always say, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2477.6s)]
*  one of them always say, I gave him or her everything, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2479.44s)]
*  everything except what they needed. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2482.7000000000003s)]
*  If you gave them what they needed, they wouldn't be leaving. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2484.84s)]
*  Do you think we're afraid of someone [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2486.7200000000003s)]
*  to say what we need though too? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2487.84s)]
*  Or do you think we even know what we need sometimes? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2489.2400000000002s)]
*  Most people don't, you're absolutely right. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2491.44s)]
*  Most people not only don't say it, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2492.68s)]
*  but most people don't even know it. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2493.9199999999996s)]
*  They're not even honest with themselves yet. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2495.6s)]
*  And how do we get that? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2497.3199999999997s)]
*  Because it almost seems like you're just wandering around [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2498.16s)]
*  in the dark if you don't even know [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2500.7999999999997s)]
*  that there's wiring in the walls, kind of. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2504.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, there's a part of your brain [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2507.48s)]
*  called the reticular activating system, big words, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2508.96s)]
*  that scientists usually call it the RAS. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2511.04s)]
*  It determines what you notice. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2513.56s)]
*  So there are millions of things you could focus on [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2515.2599999999998s)]
*  even in this moment. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2517.12s)]
*  The blood rushing through your ear, the heartbeat, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2518.48s)]
*  your clothing touching your skin, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2520.3999999999996s)]
*  but you're not thinking about all that, right? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2521.72s)]
*  You delete all that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2523.3999999999996s)]
*  You focus on a small number of things. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2524.56s)]
*  The RAS notices what you are going to focus on. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2526.6s)]
*  So if you get clear on what you want, you just say, okay, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2529.3799999999997s)]
*  and by the way, when you say relationship, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2532.2799999999997s)]
*  people, I don't know what I want, I go, great. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2533.48s)]
*  Describe the relationship from hell. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2535.0s)]
*  What do you don't want? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2536.52s)]
*  Tell me everything you know. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2537.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't want a person like this, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2538.2s)]
*  I don't want to be like that, I don't want to be, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2539.04s)]
*  and that creates energy. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2540.56s)]
*  When they're done with a whole list, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2541.8799999999997s)]
*  then I go right the opposite [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2543.7799999999997s)]
*  and you have the relationship from heaven. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2544.8799999999997s)]
*  Or I don't know what I want in a career or job. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2546.3999999999996s)]
*  Right, everything you don't want. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2548.04s)]
*  Who do you not want to work with? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2548.8799999999997s)]
*  What kind of work do you not want to do? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2550.0s)]
*  People get their energy going with that. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2551.4s)]
*  They're okay, right the opposite. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2552.76s)]
*  You got the job from heaven. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2553.8s)]
*  So once you know what it is that you really, really want, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2555.12s)]
*  now all you got to do is figure out, okay, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2557.76s)]
*  what's gotten in the way? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2560.08s)]
*  What do I need to shift? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2561.56s)]
*  How can I meet my needs in a better way? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2563.2s)]
*  But that's why we do events like this, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2565.1s)]
*  because telling people to just go do that [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2567.0s)]
*  in their normal environment is difficult. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2568.8s)]
*  But when you go into total focus, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2570.72s)]
*  it's like I started to say earlier, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2572.24s)]
*  if you want to learn a language, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2573.36s)]
*  and you went to high school, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2575.46s)]
*  did you take a foreign language in high school? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2576.56s)]
*  I got to Spanish one and Spanish, I think 2000. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2578.52s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2581.92s)]
*  And do you speak Spanish well now? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2583.84s)]
*  No, our guy didn't even speak, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2585.1600000000003s)]
*  our guy was like he got busted for fraud or something, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2586.36s)]
*  but I don't know what we learned. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2588.4s)]
*  Yeah, but I was in there for, I was in there. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2590.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was in there. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2592.2400000000002s)]
*  But the reason you don't recall it [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2593.08s)]
*  was because it was a little bit at a time. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2594.36s)]
*  The brain doesn't learn that way. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2595.84s)]
*  The brain learns best by immersion. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2596.92s)]
*  If I said you had the money and the time, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2598.3s)]
*  I'm not going to teach you Italian. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2601.42s)]
*  I'm going to drop you in Rome [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2602.54s)]
*  and I'm going to pick you up in 90 days with no teacher. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2603.6400000000003s)]
*  90 days later, you're speaking Italian [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2606.08s)]
*  because you're in it 24 hours a day, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2607.74s)]
*  seeing it, feeling it, experiencing it. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2609.06s)]
*  That's how I teach. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2610.62s)]
*  That's why I do 12 hours for four days. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2611.66s)]
*  Right, that's why it's, yeah, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2613.54s)]
*  that's why it's an intense thing, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2614.3799999999997s)]
*  or it's immersion. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2616.06s)]
*  Yeah, and that's why it lasts. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2617.5s)]
*  That's why it lasts. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2618.4599999999996s)]
*  Ah, wow, man. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2619.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty, it's, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2621.8199999999997s)]
*  I think it's just neat to see that even just using your [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2623.66s)]
*  like seminar as an example, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2626.9799999999996s)]
*  that it takes immersion. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2629.22s)]
*  It takes some real commitment. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2633.8199999999997s)]
*  Even if people are coming for six days [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2635.8999999999996s)]
*  or even if people are going to show up for long days [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2637.8199999999997s)]
*  on Zoom for four days in a row, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2640.22s)]
*  it's like, whatever it is, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2641.42s)]
*  it takes some real commitment from ourselves [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2643.14s)]
*  to be able to do those things. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2645.18s)]
*  So I get a lot of people that get dragged there by somebody [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2646.3399999999997s)]
*  and they're like, oh, I'm going to be out of here [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2648.2599999999998s)]
*  at the first break. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2649.46s)]
*  And I remember I had a friend of mine, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2650.6s)]
*  he's now a friend of mine, he wasn't before, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2651.74s)]
*  but he came with a client and friend of mine [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2652.8999999999996s)]
*  who was an NFL player. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2655.18s)]
*  This guy's a billionaire and he sat down [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2656.54s)]
*  and he saw people clapping and moving and stuff [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2658.02s)]
*  because we move the body. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2660.46s)]
*  It's not a rah rah session. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2661.7799999999997s)]
*  It's the change of biochemistry. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2663.5s)]
*  He's a science pioneer. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2664.86s)]
*  He goes, I'm not going to do this. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2666.34s)]
*  I'm a billionaire. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2667.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't do this crap. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2668.1s)]
*  And like 30 minutes later, he's jumping. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2669.58s)]
*  He's going, this is the greatest experience of my life. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2671.3s)]
*  So sometimes you have to get in the experience [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2673.58s)]
*  to know what it is. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2675.98s)]
*  And then when you're in it and it's so enjoyable, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2676.98s)]
*  because change doesn't have to be painful. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2679.2200000000003s)]
*  It can be enjoyable. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2681.02s)]
*  But if you don't know what to do [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2682.02s)]
*  and you just do a little bit at a time, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2683.46s)]
*  pretty hard to get a real change. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2685.34s)]
*  But when you go for full immersion, that's what happens. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2686.6200000000003s)]
*  But I still write books and do audios and things like that [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2689.1400000000003s)]
*  because you need immersion [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2691.9s)]
*  and then you need some space repetition. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2692.9s)]
*  You need to feed the mind on a regular basis. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2694.98s)]
*  So I like have three things. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2696.38s)]
*  I go, I want to feed my mind every day. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2697.3s)]
*  I'm going to need to read or an audio for 20, 30 minutes. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2699.34s)]
*  So I'm constantly growing in some way. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2702.14s)]
*  I want to do immersion. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2704.06s)]
*  Even I do this two, three times a year. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2705.02s)]
*  I'll go places harder to do now because of who I am, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2706.5s)]
*  but I'll go to the back of the room. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2708.58s)]
*  I'll get somebody one-on-one to coach me about something. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2709.6600000000003s)]
*  I did this brain training, for example, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2712.1800000000003s)]
*  it was like four days and nights [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2713.9s)]
*  to put all these electrodes on your brain [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2715.78s)]
*  to teach you how to go on what's called alpha brain, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2716.98s)]
*  the part of your brain where happiness is a lot easier. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2718.9s)]
*  So I remember it was like 12 hours a day. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2721.78s)]
*  It was freezing cold in this dark room. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2724.38s)]
*  And you hear these sounds based on your brain's working, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2726.2200000000003s)]
*  your how to retrain your brain. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2729.2200000000003s)]
*  It was hell. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2730.5s)]
*  I'm like, who do I got to kill to get out of this? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2731.34s)]
*  Oh me, I'm the one to put myself in this thing. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2732.5s)]
*  But at the end of four days- [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2734.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm going to take the Del Castro. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2735.5s)]
*  It sounded like you were in the Guantanamo Bay. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2736.38s)]
*  It felt kind of like that. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2738.7000000000003s)]
*  But after four days, didn't you entertain him [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2740.02s)]
*  quite a little bit? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2741.82s)]
*  Did I read that you didn't entertain him? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2742.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I did some shows in Guantanamo Bay. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2743.5s)]
*  I heard that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2745.34s)]
*  That was really cool of you to do that. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2746.1800000000003s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2747.02s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2747.86s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2748.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you about it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2749.54s)]
*  So first of all, they have a golf course down there, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2750.38s)]
*  which I didn't even think. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2752.02s)]
*  You don't think like, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2752.86s)]
*  because it's a tropical area, right? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2754.06s)]
*  So these people, they're down there. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2756.7s)]
*  It's a beautiful area. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2757.94s)]
*  So you go down. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2759.42s)]
*  I remember the flight we went on to go down there. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2761.34s)]
*  You have to fly in like this crazy pattern, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2763.82s)]
*  I guess in case like somebody's shooting at you. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2766.54s)]
*  Like you have to be able to evade it. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2768.54s)]
*  So you go in this crazy shape [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2770.3s)]
*  and then you see like out of the darkness [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2772.38s)]
*  is just like this, it looks like a big diamond ring, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2774.2599999999998s)]
*  lit up just all the outlines of the whole base. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2777.2599999999998s)]
*  And so we went there. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2781.3399999999997s)]
*  There's all these big lizards, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2782.7799999999997s)]
*  not a lot of ladies, bring your own lady or something, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2784.3799999999997s)]
*  or bring a buddy who's willing to say he's a lady. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2787.9399999999996s)]
*  But there's some, yeah, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2793.22s)]
*  cause there's not, I think there was, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2794.06s)]
*  I think seven women down there. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2796.1s)]
*  There's like 1,100 soldiers down there though. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2797.8199999999997s)]
*  Seven women. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2800.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's a brutal environment. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2801.22s)]
*  But they are, look, I'll tell you this. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2803.62s)]
*  The first day you might be like, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2804.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't think she's my type. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2805.9s)]
*  By the fourth day, you're like, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2807.38s)]
*  that is damn Hillary Klum. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2810.6600000000003s)]
*  And you get to come home. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2813.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2814.62s)]
*  Well, the fourth, I mean, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2816.86s)]
*  there's a wedding ring shop there and it is, I mean. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2817.7000000000003s)]
*  For the seven women. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2820.6600000000003s)]
*  They're all just sitting around like this. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2822.06s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like that collection you have right there. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2823.86s)]
*  But it is, that part is pretty remarkable. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2827.62s)]
*  Oh, just the beaches they have down there, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2830.06s)]
*  real beautiful. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2832.7400000000002s)]
*  You don't hear anything about them though, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2833.58s)]
*  cause they're the ones on the military base. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2834.42s)]
*  So did you go to entertain the soldiers? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2836.58s)]
*  The soldiers, yeah. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2837.4199999999996s)]
*  We got to see some of the troop areas [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2838.4599999999996s)]
*  and we got to do like some volleyball [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2840.22s)]
*  with some of the prisoners or whatever. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2841.74s)]
*  But some of the prisoners, they made them wear like, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2843.5s)]
*  they couldn't even see while they're doing the volleyball. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2846.4599999999996s)]
*  It was bizarre, but yeah, we got to play volleyball. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2848.3399999999997s)]
*  You play volleyball and you can't see. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2850.54s)]
*  That's, yeah, that's the rules they made for them. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2852.22s)]
*  But yeah, and that might be, I don't know. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2855.4599999999996s)]
*  That might be another form of torture. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2858.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it may be. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2859.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't know what the act is or the law is, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2860.66s)]
*  but hopefully they've prevented. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2863.94s)]
*  Yeah, that shouldn't be allowed. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2865.7000000000003s)]
*  It was semi-fun, I guess, but it was, yeah. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2866.7400000000002s)]
*  But what was it like? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2869.26s)]
*  Yeah, that was amazing, man. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2870.7400000000002s)]
*  Just to be able to be down there, you know. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2871.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2873.46s)]
*  Just to be able to go do comedy there. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2874.3s)]
*  It's good of you to go and do that, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2875.14s)]
*  brighten people's spirits there. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2876.66s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2877.78s)]
*  We got to do a bunch, we got to go to go to [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2878.62s)]
*  a lot of the forward operating bases during like the, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2882.14s)]
*  not Kuwait, but maybe Iraq, like after that. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2885.42s)]
*  Like Bahrain. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2888.2200000000003s)]
*  So you're the modern day Bob Hope [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2890.9s)]
*  with a little more color. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2892.26s)]
*  We went out there, dude. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2893.2599999999998s)]
*  I think they call me Bobby Hopeless, I think. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2894.18s)]
*  But we still show up, you know. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2897.4599999999996s)]
*  Dude, I met a gal, yeah, one time. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2900.22s)]
*  I mean, I got to make out with a girl [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2902.4599999999996s)]
*  in a Black Hawk helicopter. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2904.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, I flown in one, but I haven't made out [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2907.06s)]
*  with anyone yet. Really? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2908.4599999999996s)]
*  I flown one, I was a helicopter pilot for quite a while. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2909.98s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, neither me or her were that handsome. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2912.62s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2915.54s)]
*  Are you sure it was her? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2917.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, look, dude, who knows, brother. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2918.1s)]
*  She's one of the seven. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2919.54s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2920.8999999999996s)]
*  Whatever you got to do, man. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2922.1s)]
*  It's the troops, you know. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2923.58s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2924.82s)]
*  Don't ask, don't ask. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2925.66s)]
*  That's the whole, I think that's what they're doing now. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2926.82s)]
*  But no, I noticed. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2932.2999999999997s)]
*  I noticed I mentioned that to you though, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2933.14s)]
*  is it was worth it. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2933.98s)]
*  Because in those four days, I've rewired my brain [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2935.62s)]
*  to have a different level of happiness. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2937.94s)]
*  So you believe this, you know this, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2939.58s)]
*  you've done it so many times that that is the key. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2941.7s)]
*  That's the thing, it's like you excluded out [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2943.58s)]
*  these other things of like, this is fool's gold, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2946.22s)]
*  this is fool's gold, this is fool's gold. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2948.58s)]
*  Well, I've been through plenty of fool's gold. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2950.06s)]
*  That's how you get to the good stuff. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2951.78s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2952.98s)]
*  But if you give up, if you give up [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2953.82s)]
*  because something's bullshit, most of it's bullshit. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2955.1s)]
*  But then you find those gems that really work. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2957.38s)]
*  And when you find the gems work, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2959.38s)]
*  then you can use them for the rest of your life. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2960.26s)]
*  And then you share them with other people [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2961.7s)]
*  because you can see it really works. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2963.2200000000003s)]
*  And then you get the science behind it. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2964.7400000000002s)]
*  But in the past, I've just got people with the results. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2966.54s)]
*  That is the science, right? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2969.06s)]
*  But it's nice now to have science justifying [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2970.38s)]
*  or being able to show people how powerful it is, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2972.2200000000003s)]
*  how effective it is. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2974.18s)]
*  But you know, it was in the Journal of Psychiatry last year [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2975.3s)]
*  and all the people thought this is going to spread like crazy. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2978.38s)]
*  Not one phone call because they're still selling SSRIs, right? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2980.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's good point. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2984.58s)]
*  So I mean, the same people come to me, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2985.5s)]
*  they've always come to me, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2986.66s)]
*  but nobody from the psychological community on major scale. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2987.5s)]
*  And they just did a big conference [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2990.5s)]
*  and shared the results again and people were fascinated. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2991.46s)]
*  And this came up and asked questions. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2993.9s)]
*  But there's too much money in the... [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2995.66s)]
*  And I don't know, it's just even money. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2997.14s)]
*  It's just habits. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2998.14s)]
*  This is how they do their business. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=2998.98s)]
*  It's a business, right, for those people. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3000.62s)]
*  So what do you say to somebody like me then, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3002.1s)]
*  or I mean, sorry, I'm sitting here, so also me, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3003.7s)]
*  but yeah, like who's, because there's ways, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3006.02s)]
*  right when I weaned off of my medicine, right? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3011.1000000000004s)]
*  I got to talk, I actually didn't talk to my doctor, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3013.42s)]
*  but I've gotten off so many times over the years. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3016.06s)]
*  I felt like I knew what I was doing. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3018.26s)]
*  I did let my close friends know, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3019.6200000000003s)]
*  hey, I'm getting off my medicine. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3020.98s)]
*  Let me know if anything. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3023.02s)]
*  What were you using at the time? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3023.86s)]
*  Just Lexapro I've been taking, right? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3024.7000000000003s)]
*  And I said, let me know if anything seems strange [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3026.86s)]
*  or whatever, you know. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3028.7000000000003s)]
*  But then I started... [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3029.82s)]
*  You'd be more strange than usual. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3030.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3031.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3032.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3033.1800000000003s)]
*  Dude, if I'm just like masturbating at the house, dude, yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3035.06s)]
*  That's natural. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3038.5s)]
*  That's normal, dude, yeah. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3039.34s)]
*  That's normal behavior. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3040.78s)]
*  Right, but if I'm pet shopping, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3041.6200000000003s)]
*  you know, that's a, you need to call somebody. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3045.5s)]
*  You know your concern, call somebody. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3047.86s)]
*  I'm looking at a dog, that's really scary. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3049.1800000000003s)]
*  Can he fetch? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3051.86s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's getting weird. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3052.7000000000003s)]
*  But what I'm saying is, yeah, so there, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3055.26s)]
*  but I started running, right? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3058.1800000000003s)]
*  I knew I said- [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3059.26s)]
*  That's great. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3060.26s)]
*  My biggest thing is I don't want to lose this bad, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3061.1000000000004s)]
*  this opportunity to see how I'm feeling [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3063.78s)]
*  because I'm not doing my part of taking care of myself. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3066.94s)]
*  You know, I have so much respect for you doing that. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3071.06s)]
*  It's so hard to do, but you did the right thing, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3072.5s)]
*  which is what I teach. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3074.06s)]
*  You got to replace it with something. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3075.14s)]
*  You don't stop doing something, you replace something else, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3076.26s)]
*  but what you're replacing it with [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3078.3s)]
*  actually changes your biochemistry. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3079.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't want to run, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3080.9s)]
*  but now I'm starting to fricking like it, dude. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3081.7400000000002s)]
*  Isn't that cool? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3083.9s)]
*  I met somebody yesterday [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3084.7400000000002s)]
*  and we got some damn Brooks shoes together. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3085.58s)]
*  Well, that's a good first step. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3087.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, literally, yeah. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3090.18s)]
*  But you're right, but you get the runner's high [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3091.02s)]
*  and it's a good high for you and you're making... [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3092.82s)]
*  So it's like, it's not about stopping what you're doing. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3094.86s)]
*  It's about starting something else that's more fulfilling. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3097.7400000000002s)]
*  Like running, what needs does it meet? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3100.06s)]
*  Does it make you feel comfortable afterwards? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3102.02s)]
*  Do you feel certain you're going to feel good when you run? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3103.78s)]
*  100%. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3105.5s)]
*  Do you have variety when you run? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3106.34s)]
*  Is it like a totally different state? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3107.3s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes I'll go around the track this way, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3108.7000000000003s)]
*  sometimes I'll go around the track this way. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3110.26s)]
*  Okay, and do you have sense of significance? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3111.82s)]
*  Like, shit, I'm really changing. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3113.98s)]
*  I'm improving, I'm becoming more. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3115.1800000000003s)]
*  Some guy the other day, like this kind of tough guy, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3116.86s)]
*  was like, man, you've been out there for a while. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3119.3s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3121.46s)]
*  That made me feel good. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3122.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3123.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you feel more connected to yourself or God [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3123.96s)]
*  when you're running or the universe or nature [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3125.56s)]
*  or anything like that? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3127.36s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like I'm able to have some kind of, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3128.2s)]
*  or like my brain will have conversations [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3129.48s)]
*  that maybe I've been meaning to have or whatever. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3131.08s)]
*  They just kind of show up while I'm running. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3133.32s)]
*  And do you feel like you're growing by doing this running? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3134.96s)]
*  By getting better? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3136.92s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's not going to hurt me, that's for sure. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3138.84s)]
*  Yeah, and there may be some form of contribution [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3141.88s)]
*  that'll come out of it because you feel so much better, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3143.88s)]
*  you'll be able to give more. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3146.2s)]
*  So you meet at least four or five of your needs by running. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3147.36s)]
*  Versus the drugs made you feel certain. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3150.48s)]
*  Did they make you feel variety? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3153.24s)]
*  No, that was the biggest problem. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3156.16s)]
*  That was boring and dead, right? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3157.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't have any feelings. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3158.2799999999997s)]
*  That's dead. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3159.12s)]
*  Did they make you feel significant? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3159.9599999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3161.4399999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3162.2799999999997s)]
*  Did they make you feel connected? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3163.12s)]
*  No. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3165.2s)]
*  No. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3166.04s)]
*  Did they make you feel like you're growing? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3166.8799999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3168.4799999999996s)]
*  Contributing to others? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3169.3199999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3171.72s)]
*  So it met one need. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3172.56s)]
*  But when you get in the habit of it and you're numb, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3174.2s)]
*  it's hard to shift. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3175.7999999999997s)]
*  So the only reason people shift is they hit a threshold. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3176.68s)]
*  I'll give you the chemistry of transformation. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3180.2s)]
*  You see how it works for you. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3181.9599999999996s)]
*  There's five elements that when they're there, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3183.92s)]
*  people transform. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3185.36s)]
*  So the first one that usually happens is satiation. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3186.52s)]
*  Satiation means there's nothing wrong, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3189.2799999999997s)]
*  but you've been in the same thing over and over [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3191.0s)]
*  and over again after a while. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3193.0s)]
*  If your favorite meal was steak and lobster, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3194.16s)]
*  and you have it every day, three times a day, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3196.84s)]
*  there's gonna be a point where you go like, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3199.44s)]
*  there's nothing wrong with steak and lobster, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3200.2799999999997s)]
*  but man, I'm satiated, right? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3201.88s)]
*  And that makes you look around, what might do different? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3203.64s)]
*  But it doesn't usually make you change. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3207.12s)]
*  It just opens your mind to change. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3208.44s)]
*  Then you need the second element, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3210.48s)]
*  and that is dissatisfaction. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3212.04s)]
*  Now it's not just you're doing it and it's not as good. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3213.76s)]
*  Now you're doing it and it doesn't feel good. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3216.28s)]
*  And you start to feel that in the relationship side. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3218.64s)]
*  Like this, I don't wanna feel this way. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3220.92s)]
*  Then that's still not enough. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3223.4s)]
*  That makes you look more for a change. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3224.48s)]
*  That's the second piece of chemistry. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3226.08s)]
*  The third piece of chemistry is now you hit a threshold. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3227.56s)]
*  Threshold's like, you ever been in a relationship [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3231.08s)]
*  like way too long? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3232.96s)]
*  Oh yes, brother. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3234.88s)]
*  You knew it was wrong. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3236.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm sorry, I wanna apologize too [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3237.4s)]
*  to a couple of women. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3238.52s)]
*  Yeah, I should have just. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3240.56s)]
*  You knew it was wrong. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3241.76s)]
*  You knew it wasn't serving them or serving you, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3242.6s)]
*  but you stayed because it was certain. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3244.36s)]
*  It was hard to change. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3246.76s)]
*  Well, what if I'm alone? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3248.2000000000003s)]
*  I was afraid to say certain things, yeah. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3249.28s)]
*  But if you got to the point where the way you stay [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3251.44s)]
*  is you go, it'll get better. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3253.8s)]
*  It was better in the past. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3255.28s)]
*  Or you jump to the future and say it's better. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3256.36s)]
*  But there's a day we hit a threshold and you go, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3258.52s)]
*  it's been painful in the past. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3260.1600000000003s)]
*  It's painful today. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3261.44s)]
*  It's gonna be painful forever. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3262.28s)]
*  I'm the F outta here, right? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3263.1600000000003s)]
*  That's when people start to change. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3264.6800000000003s)]
*  When you hit a threshold, you get the fourth piece. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3266.2000000000003s)]
*  You get an insight. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3268.44s)]
*  And the insight is what's really true. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3269.8s)]
*  And you usually figure it out. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3271.08s)]
*  It's not my partner. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3271.96s)]
*  It's not my job. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3273.12s)]
*  It's me. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3274.6s)]
*  What's going on in me? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3275.68s)]
*  And you make a distinction and that creates an opening. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3277.0s)]
*  There's a chance for you to change your life in that moment. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3280.08s)]
*  You had that when you were here [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3282.0s)]
*  and you couldn't feel anything with this girl. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3283.2s)]
*  You felt dissatisfaction. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3285.2s)]
*  You eventually got to a threshold. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3286.52s)]
*  You finally said, wait a second. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3287.96s)]
*  These drugs are just making me numb. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3289.4s)]
*  I gotta do something. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3291.12s)]
*  You had to jump through the opening [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3292.48s)]
*  because you didn't know it was on the other side. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3294.64s)]
*  There's uncertainty. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3296.2s)]
*  A lot of people go through all that [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3297.2s)]
*  and they get to the opening. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3298.52s)]
*  It only stays open for a few moments. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3299.4s)]
*  If you don't do something with the insight, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3301.48s)]
*  it closes and you start all over again. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3304.2400000000002s)]
*  You gotta go through all the time period of getting satiated [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3305.96s)]
*  and getting dissatisfied again, getting a threshold. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3308.44s)]
*  And some people just never jump through the hole. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3311.2000000000003s)]
*  So I used to kick people through the opening. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3312.8s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen a couple of videos of you doing it. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3314.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm like, whoa. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3317.32s)]
*  So, but now what I do more is I bring them to the opening [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3318.32s)]
*  over and over and get them to jump through. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3322.48s)]
*  So they get the muscle. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3324.48s)]
*  Because otherwise it might last a year or two, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3326.08s)]
*  but it's not gonna last forever. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3327.92s)]
*  If you do it, you got a chance [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3328.92s)]
*  to make it lasting for a long time. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3330.32s)]
*  But you went through that chemistry, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3331.56s)]
*  but very few people do. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3333.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3334.36s)]
*  You got dissatisfied enough. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3335.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm thinking of some comedy duos [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3336.52s)]
*  who have gotten it done over the years. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3338.6800000000003s)]
*  Key and Peele come to mind. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3341.6400000000003s)]
*  Faye and Poehler. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3344.6800000000003s)]

*  One thing that I think keeps a lot of people [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3581.78s)]
*  from progressing in life and stuff is shame. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3583.5s)]
*  How is shame, it's almost hard to find, first of all. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3588.7s)]
*  People can say you're ashamed of yourself, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3593.7s)]
*  and I can say that, yeah, I'm ashamed of myself. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3595.14s)]
*  But it's really a feeling, you have to really, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3598.18s)]
*  and it's so like, it's like a, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3601.18s)]
*  it's so vague, kind of, if that makes any sense. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3605.42s)]
*  But it feels like one of the biggest sicknesses [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3608.2999999999997s)]
*  of our being. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3610.7s)]
*  Shame is one of the most negative emotions [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3613.02s)]
*  because what it does is it shrinks everything in you [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3614.66s)]
*  and it puts you in such a negative state [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3617.66s)]
*  that your energy drops. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3619.94s)]
*  So think of it this way, when your energy's really low, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3620.8999999999996s)]
*  you do very little to change things, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3623.3799999999997s)]
*  everything seems impossible, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3625.3399999999997s)]
*  you don't respond to other people at the same level. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3627.06s)]
*  When you're super high energy, you've done whatever it takes, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3629.1s)]
*  you're either excited about your future, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3631.02s)]
*  or you're present, or you're working on yourself, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3632.46s)]
*  or you're working out, like running, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3634.3399999999997s)]
*  and you're that high energy, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3635.7799999999997s)]
*  the same problem can happen, you can laugh at it, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3637.2999999999997s)]
*  or crack a joke at it, and it's easy, right? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3638.8599999999997s)]
*  So your energy level, with certain emotions increase [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3641.3799999999997s)]
*  and other emotions goes through the floor, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3644.7799999999997s)]
*  and when you beat yourself up, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3645.98s)]
*  or you have shame, or anything like that, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3647.58s)]
*  your energy goes down, and then it's even harder to change, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3649.26s)]
*  which then creates more shame. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3651.7400000000002s)]
*  See, I said I was gonna change, I didn't change, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3652.7s)]
*  what's wrong with me, why can't I do this? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3654.42s)]
*  And then you start building up a story [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3657.62s)]
*  that it's something wrong with you. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3659.7400000000002s)]
*  And what I try to explain to people, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3660.94s)]
*  there's nothing wrong with you, you're not broken, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3662.58s)]
*  you don't need to be fixed, I'm not here to be your guru. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3664.5s)]
*  What you need is there's some patterns, some habits, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3666.94s)]
*  in the way you use your mind and your body. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3669.5s)]
*  If we change those habits, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3671.98s)]
*  you'll have a different experience, that's all it is. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3673.14s)]
*  But being ashamed will keep you away from that, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3675.42s)]
*  because it'll put the energy so negatively in your body, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3677.3s)]
*  and you're so wiped out that it's like it's impossible. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3680.1s)]
*  And then when you're in a shame, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3683.86s)]
*  you come up with all these negative beliefs about yourself. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3684.94s)]
*  And once you believe something, what do you believe it's true, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3686.9s)]
*  or you believe it's not is true? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3689.26s)]
*  Because when you believe something's true, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3690.78s)]
*  you'll find evidence for it. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3692.34s)]
*  I'll give you a little test. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3694.1400000000003s)]
*  Look around this room right now, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3695.42s)]
*  and notice everything you can see that's brown, okay? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3696.7000000000003s)]
*  Everything you can find, it's a test. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3698.94s)]
*  Look all around, both sides of you, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3700.62s)]
*  anything you see that's brown, people at home, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3701.98s)]
*  look at that in your own room. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3703.5s)]
*  What you see is brown, okay? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3704.42s)]
*  Close your eyes. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3705.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3706.78s)]
*  Tell me everything you just saw that was red. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3707.62s)]
*  Now obviously, you saw a lot more brown, didn't you? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3710.38s)]
*  Yeah. Why? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3713.02s)]
*  Because you're looking for it. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3713.86s)]
*  Open your eyes, now look for red. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3714.7000000000003s)]
*  Look for red anywhere you can find red, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3716.62s)]
*  any place you can find red. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3718.34s)]
*  Okay. Okay? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3719.46s)]
*  Did you find more red this time? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3720.3s)]
*  How come? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3721.7400000000002s)]
*  Because I was looking for red. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3722.82s)]
*  That's right. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3723.7000000000003s)]
*  Once you develop a belief, you find what supports it. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3724.58s)]
*  So watch this. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3727.06s)]
*  You will find stuff that's not even there [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3728.34s)]
*  in order to be successful. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3730.02s)]
*  I bet you saw some Bay shit, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3731.94s)]
*  called it brown just to feel successful, did you? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3733.62s)]
*  Right over there. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3735.46s)]
*  I bet you saw some things burgundy [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3736.66s)]
*  and called them red just so you could feel successful. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3738.2999999999997s)]
*  A fact in some of those now and later. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3740.2599999999998s)]
*  See what I'm saying? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3742.58s)]
*  If you think you're screwed up, you're messed up, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3743.42s)]
*  you're gonna find and you're gonna color yourself that way. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3745.2599999999998s)]
*  If you think someone else is a jerk, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3747.7799999999997s)]
*  if you think they're your friend and they have a bad day, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3749.7s)]
*  they have bad behavior, well, they're having a bad day. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3752.22s)]
*  If you think they're a bad person, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3754.62s)]
*  then it's always gonna be that way. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3756.38s)]
*  What was the first part you said of that? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3757.98s)]
*  If you think. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3759.7799999999997s)]
*  Whether you think it's true or whether you think it's not, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3760.7799999999997s)]
*  it's gonna be true for you. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3762.46s)]
*  In other words, whatever you believe is self-evident. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3763.3s)]
*  You reinforce what you believe. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3765.1800000000003s)]
*  You found what you were looking for. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3766.9s)]
*  So you gotta train yourself to look for something different. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3769.42s)]
*  That's why I do priming and that's why I do immersion. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3771.46s)]
*  Because after four or five days of thinking differently, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3773.7000000000003s)]
*  seeing differently, focusing differently, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3776.26s)]
*  different beliefs, you have a different life. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3778.02s)]
*  A different experience. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3780.34s)]
*  But if you do it for a few minutes, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3781.26s)]
*  kind of hard to do. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3783.42s)]
*  So that's why I still do events [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3784.46s)]
*  because immersion has so much power. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3785.6600000000003s)]
*  But some people do it through an audio. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3786.82s)]
*  They listen to an audio 30 minutes a day, every day, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3788.1800000000003s)]
*  and they develop a new set of habits. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3790.86s)]
*  Or they do it by exercising. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3792.74s)]
*  Or they do reading a book and then they use it right away. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3794.5s)]
*  So there's lots of ways to get there, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3797.1s)]
*  but immersion's the fastest way. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3798.74s)]
*  It is. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3800.02s)]
*  And that's the fastest method. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3800.9399999999996s)]
*  You use it for yourself too? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3802.7799999999997s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3804.14s)]
*  It's like going to that class. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3804.9799999999996s)]
*  Why am I still doing that? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3806.4199999999996s)]
*  Because you gotta keep growing. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3807.66s)]
*  And every time you make a new insight, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3808.7799999999997s)]
*  it stacks on all the other good things. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3810.4599999999996s)]
*  You can stack the negative and be overwhelmed, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3812.74s)]
*  or you can stack the positive [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3814.62s)]
*  and feel this tremendous sense of momentum. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3816.06s)]
*  And that's the other secret. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3817.62s)]
*  Momentum. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3818.8199999999997s)]
*  You're getting momentum right now, it sounds like. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3820.3399999999997s)]
*  Momentum is like you've ever watched a team [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3822.98s)]
*  and they're getting their butt kicked [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3824.38s)]
*  and then somebody suddenly does something magical. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3825.86s)]
*  They steal the ball, they do something, and boom! [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3828.26s)]
*  It creates a spark and then the other team takes over. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3830.7400000000002s)]
*  Momentum shifts everything. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3833.86s)]
*  And momentum comes by doing the right thing over and over [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3835.5s)]
*  and after a while, it becomes what you expect to do. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3838.7000000000003s)]
*  Or another one is certainty. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3842.1000000000004s)]
*  I work with a lot of great athletes. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3844.0600000000004s)]
*  Those rings are from all, that's from, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3845.1800000000003s)]
*  I own some teams like the LAFC football club [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3848.0600000000004s)]
*  and the Golden State Warriors on a piece of them, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3850.38s)]
*  the Dodgers on a piece of them, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3852.5s)]
*  but I've also coached them all. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3853.58s)]
*  So those are all national championship rings that I've got. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3854.9s)]
*  So I'm really proud of those rings. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3857.06s)]
*  They're a representation of what I was able to build [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3858.26s)]
*  by working with these people. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3860.5s)]
*  But when you look at the people [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3861.98s)]
*  that are the best of the best, they have certainty. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3862.98s)]
*  If you see Steph Curry, you know, one of the Warriors, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3865.7400000000002s)]
*  he makes those three-point shots [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3868.34s)]
*  on almost half court, right? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3869.94s)]
*  He releases the ball, he doesn't wait to go through, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3871.82s)]
*  he turns around and just like he already knows it's in. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3873.82s)]
*  Like, how does he do that? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3876.3s)]
*  He's a genius. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3877.94s)]
*  Well, true, but where did the genius come from? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3878.78s)]
*  He's been shooting 500 shots a day every single day, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3880.78s)]
*  seven days a week for his entire adult life [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3885.42s)]
*  and most of his teens. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3888.46s)]
*  Now think about that. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3890.6600000000003s)]
*  He's been in the NBA 15 years. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3891.5s)]
*  He's the greatest three-point shooter [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3893.0600000000004s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3894.46s)]
*  He made 3,360 something shots now, three-point shots. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3895.46s)]
*  No one even close. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3899.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3900.46s)]
*  500 shots a day, that's 14,000 shots a month. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3902.6200000000003s)]
*  That's 168,000 shots a year. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3906.26s)]
*  That's over 15 years. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3908.14s)]
*  Just his professional career. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3909.2999999999997s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3910.62s)]
*  2.52 million shots he's taken in practice [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3911.46s)]
*  so that he could make 3,300 and be the greatest in history. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3914.7799999999997s)]
*  So people get rewarded in public [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3918.98s)]
*  for what they practice in private. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3921.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3923.06s)]
*  Sometimes I have a tough time feeling proud of myself. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3925.3399999999997s)]
*  Do you know what that, you know, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3927.7799999999997s)]
*  and I think I've had other people call in our show [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3928.94s)]
*  that have talked about that, you know? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3931.86s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3933.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3935.54s)]
*  I feel like, I almost feel like there's a disconnect. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3936.38s)]
*  Like it doesn't even land on me. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3941.02s)]
*  Or I feel like maybe if I feel like I'm proud of myself, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3943.34s)]
*  like if I actually feel proud of myself, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3945.98s)]
*  it'll go against some script that I've always had written [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3949.9s)]
*  or some thing that was always written inside of me. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3952.62s)]
*  You know, it's almost like it wouldn't, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3958.1s)]
*  if I wrote on the wall of myself, I'm proud of you, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3960.3s)]
*  it wouldn't even fucking show up on the wall. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3963.1s)]
*  What emotion would you feel if you saw that? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3965.58s)]
*  Like what emotion would I feel if I saw what? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3968.5s)]
*  I'm proud of myself. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3970.38s)]
*  Would you go bullshit? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3971.22s)]
*  Would you be pissed off by it? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3972.06s)]
*  Would you be annoyed? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3973.38s)]
*  Would you just feel it's inauthentic? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3974.22s)]
*  No, I think I feel ashamed of myself for even thinking it. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3975.06s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3977.42s)]
*  And it produced an emotion in you just now, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3978.62s)]
*  even when you just thought about it. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3980.14s)]
*  I saw that flash in your eyes. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3981.06s)]
*  It's just a little bit of water, a little bit of fluid. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3982.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3984.54s)]
*  Fuck, we cry on here every week. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3985.54s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3986.82s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3987.66s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3988.7s)]
*  But yeah, we don't have any shame about that. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3989.54s)]
*  No, you shouldn't. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3991.3s)]
*  But I'm saying liquid leaving your body in a public place [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3992.14s)]
*  as long as it's through your eyes is not a problem. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3994.46s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3995.94s)]
*  Huh? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3997.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, don't ask, don't ask. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=3998.38s)]
*  That's right. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4000.54s)]
*  But my point is there's a real anchor for you there. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4001.66s)]
*  So let me explain it to you. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4004.62s)]
*  Everybody has what I call an emotional home. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4006.1s)]
*  Do you ever watch like a place here [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4008.7s)]
*  and let's say where the cyclone happens [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4011.3s)]
*  every two or three years and wipes out everything [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4013.34s)]
*  or a tornado comes through. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4015.1s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4016.42s)]
*  And you see these poor people, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4017.26s)]
*  all their stuff's all over the ground [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4018.08s)]
*  and they're picking it up. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4019.3s)]
*  And you could have a heart of stone not to feel. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4020.38s)]
*  They rebuild. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4022.7400000000002s)]
*  Two years again, it happens again. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4023.58s)]
*  Two years later, it happens again. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4024.62s)]
*  Some part of you eventually goes, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4025.58s)]
*  why don't you move? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4026.62s)]
*  You know, it's like, why don't you move? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4027.9s)]
*  A lot of Vietnam's like that, it floods. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4030.1s)]
*  New Orleans is like that, it floods. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4031.74s)]
*  New Orleans is like that. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4033.18s)]
*  So here's why don't they move? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4034.02s)]
*  Because it's home. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4035.46s)]
*  It's what they know. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4036.66s)]
*  We have an emotional home. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4037.8199999999997s)]
*  We have certain emotions that got built up in your youth. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4039.46s)]
*  And I had four fathers, I had a mother, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4042.54s)]
*  it was pretty intense. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4043.98s)]
*  And I had a lot of emotions that came out of that experience. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4045.46s)]
*  If I didn't reprogram myself, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4047.9s)]
*  I wouldn't be sitting here with you today [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4050.16s)]
*  because my emotional home was not good feelings. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4051.9s)]
*  That's what I was used to. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4054.02s)]
*  So even though it didn't feel good, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4054.86s)]
*  you go there because it's what you know. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4056.1400000000003s)]
*  It's comfortable. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4058.5s)]
*  Yeah, it almost felt like I was deserting myself [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4059.7400000000002s)]
*  if I felt good about myself, which is crazy. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4061.86s)]
*  I almost felt like I was leaving. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4064.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4067.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like I knew those feelings. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4068.38s)]
*  Finish that thought, I'm leaving what? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4069.82s)]
*  Well, it's almost like I feel like I know those feelings [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4071.46s)]
*  of not feeling good about myself so well [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4073.46s)]
*  that I would be, I don't want to leave them alone [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4076.34s)]
*  because we always had each other. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4079.46s)]
*  And it was like, if I leave them, you know. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4082.42s)]
*  Have you ever had a friend? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4086.14s)]
*  If I leave them, I just, I won't, I don't know. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4087.98s)]
*  Does that make sense though? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4089.98s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4090.98s)]
*  You want what? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4091.82s)]
*  If I leave them, I'll just be letting them down. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4093.14s)]
*  And they're not even real, but they're, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4095.18s)]
*  it's a part of me, some part of me inside of me [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4098.62s)]
*  I can't even access. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4100.3s)]
*  They're like his brothers. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4101.82s)]
*  That's right, they're your home, brother. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4104.22s)]
*  And by the way, I really appreciate you being so vulnerable [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4106.14s)]
*  because the people watching there seeing that [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4109.22s)]
*  allow them to be vulnerable because you're a role model [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4111.06s)]
*  of that and it's because you're funny as shit, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4113.1s)]
*  but to be able to be that vulnerable is beautiful. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4115.02s)]
*  But let me just tell you something. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4116.54s)]
*  Those are not your friends. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4118.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4120.26s)]
*  And you're not going to abandon those parts of yourself. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4121.46s)]
*  You're going to find these other parts of yourself [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4124.38s)]
*  that need to be in charge. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4126.06s)]
*  It's not to say that you can't have negative emotions [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4127.18s)]
*  or fears or feelings, but the ones that don't support you, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4129.18s)]
*  you got to break that pattern. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4132.860000000001s)]
*  And the way you break the pattern first [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4133.9400000000005s)]
*  is you start to see, you get a new experience. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4135.780000000001s)]
*  If I get you an experience where you feel [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4138.82s)]
*  like you actually felt proud of yourself [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4141.099999999999s)]
*  without those feelings and there was no sense of loss [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4142.9s)]
*  and I did that with you for days and days, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4146.9s)]
*  you'll never go back. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4149.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4150.42s)]
*  Because your brain will go, what the F? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4151.259999999999s)]
*  I'm not going back to that bullshit. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4152.74s)]
*  Those weren't my friends. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4154.54s)]
*  It'd be like having a friend that beats the shit out of you [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4155.38s)]
*  every single day and it's like I'm letting them down [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4158.219999999999s)]
*  if I don't want to beat the shit out of me. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4160.5s)]
*  It's like, oh no, I got to be there for them [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4162.0599999999995s)]
*  because I got to be there so they can beat the shit [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4164.5s)]
*  out of me on the face. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4165.82s)]
*  That's pretty much what it's happening. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4167.14s)]
*  That is crazy to hear, dude. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4167.9800000000005s)]
*  You're like, now here we go again. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4169.46s)]
*  And so then what happens though is the reason you went [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4171.22s)]
*  for the antidepressants is it's so overwhelming [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4173.18s)]
*  that numbing at least feels a little less. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4176.22s)]
*  I'd rather see you cry and feel the pain [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4178.26s)]
*  even though I don't want you to feel pain as a brother. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4179.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm grateful to feel it. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4181.740000000001s)]
*  I want it out of my system. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4182.9400000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4183.9400000000005s)]
*  But the next step for you is drawing a line in the sand [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4184.9800000000005s)]
*  of how you really want to feel. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4187.46s)]
*  So I'll have people in the vent write down, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4188.42s)]
*  I give them like a minute. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4190.58s)]
*  I go, draw a line in the middle, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4191.42s)]
*  write down on the left side all the positive emotions [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4193.34s)]
*  you feel in an average week, not once a year, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4195.7s)]
*  not once a month, the ones you regularly feel, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4197.66s)]
*  whatever good feelings. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4199.86s)]
*  The average emotion is in a positive week. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4200.7s)]
*  So what are some of the ones you feel in a week? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4202.86s)]
*  In a week? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4204.62s)]
*  At least once a week. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4206.22s)]
*  Okay, any emotion? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4207.099999999999s)]
*  Positive, start with a positive. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4208.62s)]
*  Positive, hopeful, thankful, loving, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4209.62s)]
*  and maybe some pride. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4217.5s)]
*  Good, and so the pride is sneaking in. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4221.46s)]
*  That's not ego pride, that's pride of like, you're growing. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4224.42s)]
*  Well, I'm learning about pride. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4227.1s)]
*  I mean, like I said, it's really hard for me [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4228.06s)]
*  to feel proud of myself. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4229.62s)]
*  So stop saying that. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4230.9400000000005s)]
*  Because every time you say that, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4232.22s)]
*  you're rewiring it back into your body. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4233.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a story. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4236.06s)]
*  There's an old phrase that says, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4237.38s)]
*  tell a lie big enough, tell a lie big enough, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4238.42s)]
*  loud enough and long enough, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4240.74s)]
*  sooner or later people believe it. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4241.78s)]
*  You know who said that? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4242.9400000000005s)]
*  Hitler. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4244.22s)]
*  Oh, I think you're gonna say Fauci. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4245.06s)]
*  Well, same difference. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4246.5s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4247.34s)]
*  We're aligning on that one, brother. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4252.06s)]
*  You're a quicker thinker than I am. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4255.26s)]
*  But no, so yeah, we hear what we're saying. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4257.06s)]
*  But the conversation you've said with yourself, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4258.9800000000005s)]
*  how many times do you think you've said that? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4261.18s)]
*  Said what? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4263.5s)]
*  That, you know, it's hard for me. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4264.34s)]
*  I say it a lot. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4266.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's because I think I'm, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4268.14s)]
*  yeah, it's like having a new story for myself. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4269.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, part of me is still, there's a heavy bit, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4272.5s)]
*  to have a whole new story, having a new story. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4275.22s)]
*  Even having some success in my life, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4277.7s)]
*  it's almost like some of it feels embarrassing. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4279.5s)]
*  And some people feel like, you know, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4282.26s)]
*  I'm the guy that's got the imposter syndrome, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4283.58s)]
*  it's all bullshit, it's just fear that you're not enough. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4284.9400000000005s)]
*  We all have that fear, brother. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4286.46s)]
*  I feel that at times. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4287.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't feel it much now, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4288.9800000000005s)]
*  but I'm 63 years old and I've done a shitload of things [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4290.38s)]
*  for 40 years, you know. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4293.1s)]
*  You've built up a pattern. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4294.34s)]
*  Yeah, I've built up new patterns. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4295.3s)]
*  It's like a muscle. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4296.74s)]
*  Everybody's got the muscle, if you use it, it grows. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4298.18s)]
*  If you don't use it, you lose it, right? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4300.06s)]
*  It doesn't ever disappear, though. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4301.38s)]
*  It just looks like it's not there. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4303.18s)]
*  But if you demand it, you push it beyond [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4304.78s)]
*  what it's comfortable with. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4306.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's what you're doing right now. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4307.9s)]
*  You're pushing beyond your comfort. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4308.78s)]
*  You were settling for comfort to try to survive. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4310.54s)]
*  Now you're like, F that, I want more out of this life. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4314.3s)]
*  You know, I'm not gonna settle for that shit. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4317.86s)]
*  But then you keep telling yourself the old story. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4319.38s)]
*  So change your story, change your life. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4321.14s)]
*  It sounds overly simplistic, but it is true. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4322.94s)]
*  No, I love it. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4325.1s)]
*  I appreciate you saying it, yeah. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4325.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of this chat has been about that. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4327.38s)]
*  But look at the positive emotions you wrote down. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4330.22s)]
*  Or you just told me verbally, right? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4331.9s)]
*  So you're hopeful. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4333.5s)]
*  Are you playful or funny? [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4335.14s)]
*  Or what would be your term around that part of you? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4336.46s)]
*  Because I didn't hear that part of you. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4337.86s)]
*  I know it's there. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4338.78s)]
*  No, I feel like that part of me became such my work [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4339.9s)]
*  that I haven't had as much free time to be that [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4342.46s)]
*  as I would like to. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4344.54s)]
*  Oh, on your own, okay, cool. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4345.379999999999s)]
*  So those are the positives. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4346.66s)]
*  What are the negatives you feel in an average week? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4347.98s)]
*  At least once a week, not once a month, once a year. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4349.58s)]
*  What are the negative emotions you feel? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4351.7s)]
*  Ugly. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4353.219999999999s)]
*  I feel incapable. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4355.219999999999s)]
*  Angry. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4359.099999999999s)]
*  And I feel disappointing. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4362.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, so which of those emotions is most powerful for you? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4366.38s)]
*  The positive list or the negative list? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4371.7s)]
*  The negative list is more powerful. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4375.38s)]
*  And that's true for most people. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4376.78s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4378.06s)]
*  What's an emotion that if it became the dominant emotion [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4379.38s)]
*  in your life, one or two, it would get rid of those negatives [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4382.62s)]
*  like they would have any power over you? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4385.42s)]
*  What would be an emotional state? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4388.26s)]
*  Would it be like courage or would it be playfulness [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4389.22s)]
*  or would it be, let's say, joy? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4392.26s)]
*  Or would it be, you've already got gratitude, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4395.66s)]
*  more gratitude? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4397.54s)]
*  What would be an emotion that's so strong [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4398.38s)]
*  that it would get rid of the disappointment? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4400.42s)]
*  Probably love, you know? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4401.9s)]
*  There you go, and that's your core, brother. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4403.0199999999995s)]
*  I didn't hear you say that on the first one. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4404.58s)]
*  That's all you really want. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4406.54s)]
*  It's probably why you do this podcast. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4407.38s)]
*  It's probably why you make people laugh. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4408.46s)]
*  Me too, by the way. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4410.22s)]
*  The whole reason I do what I do is I love people [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4411.54s)]
*  and I love to see people happy [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4413.099999999999s)]
*  because I was so unhappy myself and I got out of it. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4413.94s)]
*  So I was so grateful. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4417.34s)]
*  It's like I feed 100 million people a year, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4418.26s)]
*  100 million meals. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4422.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why you're a charity, yeah. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4422.86s)]
*  I've done a billion meals in the last eight years. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4423.86s)]
*  Jesus Christ, dude. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4426.5s)]
*  That's what McDonald's did, isn't it? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4427.34s)]
*  And it was free. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4429.78s)]
*  They're pretty cheap at McDonald's, but dang, dude. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4431.7s)]
*  But I did it not because I'm a good person. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4434.0199999999995s)]
*  I did it because I grew up and I had no money and no food. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4435.74s)]
*  When I was 11, somebody came and fed us on Thanksgiving [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4438.38s)]
*  and I was like, that made me believe strangers care. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4440.94s)]
*  Strangers care about me and they care about strangers. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4444.0199999999995s)]
*  And so I fell in love with people [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4445.86s)]
*  and I want to make people feel happy. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4446.7s)]
*  And I know what it feels like not to food. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4448.259999999999s)]
*  I know what it feels like to be absolutely depressed [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4449.78s)]
*  and miserable and saying, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4451.7s)]
*  do I even need to stick around in this life? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4452.5s)]
*  So I don't want anybody else to feel that. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4454.86s)]
*  So it drove me to find answers, not just for me. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4456.0599999999995s)]
*  Once I found it for me, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4459.0199999999995s)]
*  I wanted to help as many people as I can. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4459.86s)]
*  Well, I don't want to do it because I love love. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4461.86s)]
*  Because when you help people that much, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4463.7s)]
*  I mean, I have so much love in my life, it's ridiculous. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4465.9s)]
*  I get stopped on the street every day [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4467.38s)]
*  and people don't come up and say, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4468.62s)]
*  oh, I like your show or something. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4469.46s)]
*  Come up and go, you changed my life. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4470.86s)]
*  Oh my God, I love you Tony Robbins. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4471.98s)]
*  And I always say, no, I didn't do it. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4473.54s)]
*  You did it, but I'm glad I helped. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4474.74s)]
*  But I love the love that comes from it. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4476.5s)]
*  So we all really want love, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4478.5s)]
*  but we're afraid we're not enough. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4480.18s)]
*  And you, my friend, you are growing like a weed right now [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4482.06s)]
*  because you're doing things most people never get out of. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4484.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm not blowing smoke your way, I'm not a bullshitter. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4486.820000000001s)]
*  I don't feel that, man. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4488.660000000001s)]
*  I appreciate you saying it. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4490.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's the truth. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4491.1s)]
*  But you got to notice your progress [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4492.54s)]
*  and you got to stack the good [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4494.860000000001s)]
*  and then you got to stop the old story. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4497.34s)]
*  And the minute you start to say that phrase, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4499.1s)]
*  bullshit, that's an old story. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4500.780000000001s)]
*  It's not true anymore. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4501.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think a part of me is afraid [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4502.9400000000005s)]
*  that I'm going to leave a part of me. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4504.06s)]
*  Like if I, you know, if I even, if I be successful. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4505.7s)]
*  So let's investigate that for a second. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4510.7s)]
*  Like if I be successful, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4512.139999999999s)]
*  I'm going to leave a part of me behind, you know. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4513.099999999999s)]
*  Well, then you're F'd right now [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4514.9s)]
*  because you're already successful. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4516.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how many millions of people, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4519.139999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that watch your podcast. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4520.26s)]
*  You make people laugh all over the world. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4521.74s)]
*  You have people that adore you. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4523.22s)]
*  I think I'm embarrassed sometimes. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4524.0599999999995s)]
*  But all those emotions are old habits. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4526.139999999999s)]
*  They're just habits. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4528.46s)]
*  So I understand that. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4529.7s)]
*  And by the way, when you feel embarrassed [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4530.54s)]
*  or you feel these negative emotions, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4533.22s)]
*  it also makes you feel for yourself for a little bit. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4536.38s)]
*  So that's the other part you might be afraid of. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4540.42s)]
*  Like some people take care of everybody. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4541.78s)]
*  Like what do you mean by that? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4543.099999999999s)]
*  Well, like for some, I don't know if this is you, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4543.94s)]
*  but some people are so busy trying [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4545.42s)]
*  to make everybody else happy all the time. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4546.58s)]
*  They don't take care of themselves [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4548.46s)]
*  unless it's a big ass problem. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4550.46s)]
*  And then for the first time, even if it's a negative feeling, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4552.9s)]
*  at least I'm feeling for myself. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4554.98s)]
*  I'm feeling for me. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4556.38s)]
*  And that might be what you're afraid of losing. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4557.22s)]
*  Let's try it for a second here. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4558.98s)]
*  What if I told you, you could go back [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4560.34s)]
*  and feel like shit as much as you want [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4562.139999999999s)]
*  and it'll never stop. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4563.38s)]
*  But you don't have to have that be [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4564.9s)]
*  the predominant emotion of your life. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4566.0199999999995s)]
*  That you just need to beat yourself up [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4569.139999999999s)]
*  or be ashamed or not be too happy. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4572.5s)]
*  That it's an old story that got wired a long time ago [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4576.74s)]
*  and has nothing to do with who you really are. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4579.219999999999s)]
*  But when you keep telling yourself, it's like my friend, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4581.5s)]
*  I need to take care of him, I'm gonna lose a part of myself. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4583.54s)]
*  No, you'll never lose that part. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4585.179999999999s)]
*  There's a part of me that would be a victim very easily. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4586.7s)]
*  I was beat as a child. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4589.98s)]
*  My mom was a beautiful woman. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4591.46s)]
*  I'm not denigrating her. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4593.219999999999s)]
*  But when she put alcohol together with prescription drugs, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4595.66s)]
*  she was crazy. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4599.5s)]
*  And I was five one in high school, believe it or not. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4600.58s)]
*  I'm six seven now. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4602.3s)]
*  I tell people the difference. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4603.139999999999s)]
*  I tell people the difference is personal growth, right? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4604.46s)]
*  But I had a tumor in my brain that made me grow. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4607.42s)]
*  But I was this little guy [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4609.0599999999995s)]
*  and she would slam my head against it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4609.9s)]
*  She'd put liquid soap down my throat [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4611.3s)]
*  because she said I was lying and I wasn't lying. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4612.82s)]
*  And when the person you love most is trying to hurt you, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4614.58s)]
*  you can do a number on your head. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4617.62s)]
*  But I look back now and fortunately, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4619.179999999999s)]
*  I didn't let that stop me. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4621.42s)]
*  And I didn't settle for that. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4623.42s)]
*  I struggled for a long time. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4625.22s)]
*  I look back and I can honestly tell you, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4627.14s)]
*  if she was the mother I'd hope she'd been. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4629.38s)]
*  Like if I was well fed, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4631.9800000000005s)]
*  you really think I'd be trying to feed a billion, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4633.3s)]
*  I've done a billion people [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4635.14s)]
*  and I'm trying to feed a hundred billion people. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4635.9800000000005s)]
*  You think I would be spending my time doing that [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4637.5s)]
*  if I was a well-fed kid? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4639.1s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4640.02s)]
*  If she had been the mother I want, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4640.9800000000005s)]
*  I wouldn't become the man I'm proud to be. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4642.18s)]
*  So those emotions are not you. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4644.26s)]
*  They were a part of your past. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4647.02s)]
*  They were a pattern. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4648.42s)]
*  It's a pattern of what you do with your body and breathe. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4649.9800000000005s)]
*  But it meets some of your needs to feel yourself [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4652.18s)]
*  or feel sorry for yourself or feel sad. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4655.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4656.900000000001s)]
*  You follow me? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4657.740000000001s)]
*  It's like a self pity thing. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4658.58s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4659.42s)]
*  But what you're really wanting is not self pity. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4660.26s)]
*  You're wanting self love. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4662.14s)]
*  You just haven't learned how to give it to yourself. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4663.700000000001s)]
*  My way of doing that is gratitude. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4665.14s)]
*  Because when you're grateful, love flows naturally. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4667.3s)]
*  Is that a common pattern that sometimes, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4669.780000000001s)]
*  because I noticed over like about two years ago, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4671.22s)]
*  I noticed that one of my biggest addictions [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4673.22s)]
*  sometimes was self pity. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4675.62s)]
*  I didn't even realize it. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4676.58s)]
*  I thought I was helping myself by like focusing on myself, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4677.9400000000005s)]
*  but really I'd been too, I was feeling too pitiful. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4681.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4684.82s)]
*  It was, man, it was, I realized my alcohol was self pity. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4685.66s)]
*  Anytime I did- [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4689.18s)]
*  Also, alcohol is a depressant. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4690.02s)]
*  So what's going to do is lower, it feels good in the moment, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4691.9800000000005s)]
*  but then it lowers your energy and your blood sugar, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4694.34s)]
*  everything, right? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4696.46s)]
*  Same for self pity? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4697.3s)]
*  Self pity, same thing. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4698.26s)]
*  Now your energy, think about it. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4699.18s)]
*  Self pity, if you're in self pity right now, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4700.66s)]
*  zero to 10, 10 is total high energy, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4702.14s)]
*  zero is no energy. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4704.46s)]
*  Where are you in self pity? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4705.34s)]
*  Where would you put it? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4706.26s)]
*  Oh, two? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4707.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4707.9800000000005s)]
*  Where are you when you're feeling excited? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4708.82s)]
*  Where's my energy? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4712.02s)]
*  Zero to 10, yeah. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4712.860000000001s)]
*  My energy when I'm feeling excited is like a nine. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4713.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4715.9400000000005s)]
*  Which one do you want to be? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4716.78s)]
*  I'd rather be the nine. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4717.7s)]
*  Yeah, well, why the fuck want us to just do that? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4718.82s)]
*  I know. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4720.54s)]
*  You know? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4721.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think, but you said a lot of it is pattern. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4722.22s)]
*  I think that's the thing. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4724.42s)]
*  And a lot of people, I think you don't notice [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4725.26s)]
*  when you're in self pity, man. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4726.78s)]
*  I had no clue. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4727.74s)]
*  Like I was still living a life and it was going well. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4728.58s)]
*  And it was going, but there was just a lot of times [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4731.02s)]
*  I was drinking my own self pity, you know? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4733.78s)]
*  And I don't feel like I do it a lot now, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4735.54s)]
*  but there's times where I can fall back into that. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4737.34s)]
*  So if you do, it's just like, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4739.66s)]
*  if you do it's like, oh, I'm going into self pity. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4741.3s)]
*  You don't beat yourself up. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4743.14s)]
*  You just go, that old pattern. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4743.98s)]
*  I don't do that shit anymore. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4745.46s)]
*  Let's get out. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4746.58s)]
*  And the best way to get out is go for your run, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4747.42s)]
*  do something physical or shift what you're doing [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4748.98s)]
*  or focus on doing something for someone you love. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4751.5s)]
*  Any of those things will get you out of your mind. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4754.099999999999s)]
*  Because here's the biggest problem. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4755.82s)]
*  All these words you're using are just forms of suffering. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4757.5s)]
*  Pain's part of life. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4761.38s)]
*  Suffering, you've heard, is an option. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4763.0199999999995s)]
*  It really is an option. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4764.42s)]
*  But what happens is when you focus on yourself, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4765.86s)]
*  there's always suffering. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4768.54s)]
*  There's three things that'll trigger your suffer. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4769.66s)]
*  If you think, three words, loss, less, never. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4771.46s)]
*  If you think something you did caused you to lose [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4774.62s)]
*  or have less of or never have love or respect [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4779.0199999999995s)]
*  or free time or financial freedom or anything. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4783.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's my one. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4786.46s)]
*  I think I feel that something, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4787.46s)]
*  there was something I did that made it that way. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4788.66s)]
*  Yes, and by the way, some people do the opposite [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4791.58s)]
*  and some people do both. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4793.9s)]
*  They look at what other people did, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4794.9s)]
*  what the government did, what this person did, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4796.1s)]
*  what some system did, something outside themselves [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4799.06s)]
*  that makes them believe they've lost something [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4800.54s)]
*  or will never have something. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4802.5s)]
*  When you think loss, less, never about yourself, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4804.22s)]
*  the mind, you're not your mind. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4807.02s)]
*  It's like all the thoughts. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4810.34s)]
*  You ever thought, I'm gonna kill this mother f. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4811.18s)]
*  Have you ever had that thought? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4813.02s)]
*  Yeah, I don't do it, but I do think it. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4813.860000000001s)]
*  But the key is you don't do it. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4815.66s)]
*  I don't do it. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4817.38s)]
*  Do you think that's your thought? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4818.22s)]
*  Are you the first person to have that thought? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4819.58s)]
*  No. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4821.34s)]
*  How long do you think that thought's been around? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4822.38s)]
*  Probably since the Bible, I bet. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4824.54s)]
*  Probably before. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4826.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4827.26s)]
*  So if I told you 100 years ago. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4828.9400000000005s)]
*  Or Cain killed Abel in the Bible, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4830.820000000001s)]
*  that's what I said there. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4832.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4832.9400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, and also there was definitely people [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4833.780000000001s)]
*  killing each other for that, so. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4834.900000000001s)]
*  But check this out. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4836.660000000001s)]
*  Think about this for a second. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4837.5s)]
*  That thought is not your thought. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4838.38s)]
*  You're being used by that thought. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4842.1s)]
*  If I said 100 years ago, there's gonna be a little box [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4844.02s)]
*  in your pocket and you can pull it out [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4846.42s)]
*  and you'll be able to touch it [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4847.860000000001s)]
*  and see people on the other side of the earth [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4848.9800000000005s)]
*  because there's invisible waves going around the earth [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4850.700000000001s)]
*  and it's gonna come in your box. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4852.820000000001s)]
*  You go, read between the lines, a. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4853.900000000001s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4855.820000000001s)]
*  But think about, or we're gonna fly to the moon and back. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4856.94s)]
*  They used to call the people who said that lunatics. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4859.219999999999s)]
*  That's where the term comes from. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4861.0599999999995s)]
*  People thought we could go to the moon. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4862.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, we've been to the moon [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4863.379999999999s)]
*  and you now have a phone that does those things. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4864.5s)]
*  Well, thoughts also have been around forever. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4866.46s)]
*  And think of your body as like cable. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4869.379999999999s)]
*  You turn one channel and it brings down a signal of comedy. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4872.339999999999s)]
*  Another channel, it's a horror picture. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4876.82s)]
*  Another channel, it's effing drama. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4879.0199999999995s)]
*  Another channel, it's adventure. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4881.299999999999s)]
*  And so when you drop your body on this, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4883.379999999999s)]
*  you get a different channel of what you see, feel, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4885.86s)]
*  and tap into than if you're like this [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4888.54s)]
*  or whatever your state is or giggling or laughing and shit, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4890.74s)]
*  then you get a different channel. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4893.66s)]
*  So the pattern of how we use our body, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4895.139999999999s)]
*  it determines what part of the thoughts we tap into. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4897.0599999999995s)]
*  But the biggest thing is if you're gonna be pissed off [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4899.5s)]
*  or sad, at least get a unique thought. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4901.7s)]
*  One, you created. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4903.42s)]
*  Don't just copy everybody else, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4904.24s)]
*  every other asshole that ever lived. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4905.42s)]
*  You're just copying it. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4907.219999999999s)]
*  Change your body, change your life. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4908.219999999999s)]
*  Change your story, change your life. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4909.9s)]
*  So you've already begun it. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4911.66s)]
*  You've gone through the chemistry of being dissatisfied. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4913.339999999999s)]
*  Enough to say I'm not gonna do the drugs. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4916.82s)]
*  I'm gonna start to run now. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4918.66s)]
*  I'm kinda liking this feeling. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4919.94s)]
*  But then you get pulled back a little bit [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4921.42s)]
*  because it's new. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4922.98s)]
*  Your old stuff you know well. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4924.299999999999s)]
*  And so you gotta just cut it off. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4926.099999999999s)]
*  And again, you could do that through immersion. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4928.0599999999995s)]
*  I'd love to have you come to one of my events [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4929.7s)]
*  and be my guest and just have your own experience. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4931.46s)]
*  But regardless, you can still do it on your own [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4933.7s)]
*  just by changing the habit, changing the habit. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4935.94s)]
*  You changed it enough. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4937.58s)]
*  It's like the more you go down a path, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4938.42s)]
*  the more it gets wired. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4940.74s)]
*  They did this at the UC Irvine. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4941.82s)]
*  They took monkeys. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4943.46s)]
*  And then they manually bend their finger like this [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4945.259999999999s)]
*  10,000 times. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4947.38s)]
*  Well now they untaped the hands. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4948.98s)]
*  And what does the monkey do? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4950.82s)]
*  No kidding. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4952.259999999999s)]
*  Well, you're not a monkey, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4953.099999999999s)]
*  but many people drive to work the same way every day. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4954.219999999999s)]
*  Get on the same subway. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4957.0599999999995s)]
*  And one day they're supposed to go a different direction. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4958.34s)]
*  Get off at a different off ramp. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4959.98s)]
*  But their brain's so used to it, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4961.0599999999995s)]
*  they get off on the wrong off ramp. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4962.3s)]
*  Well that's kinda what you're doing. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4963.86s)]
*  You get off on the off ramp of some old pattern. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4964.82s)]
*  And so what you gotta do is stop going down that path. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4967.86s)]
*  Start to go, stop, stop. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4970.099999999999s)]
*  So what they found by the way, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4971.34s)]
*  you don't have to do 10,000 times. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4972.86s)]
*  They found they could do it with 12 of these, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4975.06s)]
*  instead of 10,000, get the same wiring. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4977.3s)]
*  And the way they did it was, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4979.900000000001s)]
*  they stimulate the pleasure center of the brain. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4980.900000000001s)]
*  So it's like ha ha, ha ha, ha ha. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4982.78s)]
*  And each time they did it, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4985.3s)]
*  imagine instead of one thread of connection [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4986.26s)]
*  between neurons in the brain, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4988.06s)]
*  nerve cells in the brain, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4989.22s)]
*  one, instead when there's joy there, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4990.58s)]
*  or excitement, or pleasure, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4993.22s)]
*  you get 1,000 of them. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4994.9800000000005s)]
*  So they could do 12 and get the result without emotion, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=4996.78s)]
*  and get the same result of 10,000 movements. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5000.3s)]
*  So we wire ourselves. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5003.42s)]
*  Like you can- [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5005.06s)]
*  So I have control over that you're saying. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5006.22s)]
*  Because some people, they don't even notice it though. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5008.1s)]
*  That was amazing to me. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5009.78s)]
*  For years I didn't notice that's what I was doing. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5011.14s)]
*  And that's the- [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5013.46s)]
*  That's the part of growing, right? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5014.3s)]
*  How old are you now, may I ask? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5015.14s)]
*  I'm 43. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5015.9800000000005s)]
*  Right, so most people when you're, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5017.06s)]
*  think of it this way, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5019.7s)]
*  zero to 21 is like springtime. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5020.82s)]
*  You don't have to figure anything out. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5023.02s)]
*  You learn, you grow, things occur. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5024.38s)]
*  You might have problems and upsets, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5026.06s)]
*  but it's in your life. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5027.42s)]
*  22 to 42, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5029.5s)]
*  you're kind of the soldier of society. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5032.22s)]
*  You go out and test what you've been like. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5033.58s)]
*  I don't know if I believe the shit I was told. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5034.9800000000005s)]
*  Let me try this. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5036.7s)]
*  You think by the way, you're invincible. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5037.58s)]
*  I'm the president of the United States, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5039.46s)]
*  I'm multi-billionaire, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5040.740000000001s)]
*  and have a hundred relationships simultaneously, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5041.58s)]
*  and everyone's gonna be happy. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5043.3s)]
*  But somewhere around 35 or 40, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5044.58s)]
*  you know 45, you start going, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5046.46s)]
*  you know relationships hard, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5048.62s)]
*  and I'm not very good at this shit, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5049.740000000001s)]
*  and I'm not a billionaire yet. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5050.780000000001s)]
*  Well what's the deal here? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5051.820000000001s)]
*  And so then you have to go on a journey. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5053.06s)]
*  The hero's journey. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5055.06s)]
*  You're being called to go into the unknown, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5055.900000000001s)]
*  and try new things. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5058.46s)]
*  And if you step into the unknown, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5059.46s)]
*  you'll meet new mentors, new people. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5060.9s)]
*  You'll learn to slay the dragon. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5062.82s)]
*  You'll become the hero in your own life. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5064.66s)]
*  But ages basically 43 to 63, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5066.219999999999s)]
*  that's the reaping time of your life. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5069.9s)]
*  This is my rookie year then, huh? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5071.62s)]
*  This is when you're coming, brother. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5072.46s)]
*  That's the stage of life [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5074.0199999999995s)]
*  by the way people are the most happy, right? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5074.86s)]
*  If they're healthy. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5076.86s)]
*  And the very happiest is usually 64 to 84, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5077.98s)]
*  if they're healthy. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5082.139999999999s)]
*  And people can live to 104, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5083.46s)]
*  oldest people 120. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5085.66s)]
*  But each stage has different problems [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5087.139999999999s)]
*  and different opportunities. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5088.78s)]
*  So you're entering your power. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5089.98s)]
*  And it's showing up, right? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5092.0599999999995s)]
*  You've got a large audience. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5092.94s)]
*  Your humor's become more playful, more refined. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5093.94s)]
*  But now you're like, I want more. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5096.78s)]
*  I want me to be happy. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5098.179999999999s)]
*  Look at comedians that have killed themselves. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5099.74s)]
*  I mean we could make a long list [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5103.0199999999995s)]
*  of people that made everybody happy except themselves. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5104.459999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, people think of Robin Williams, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5106.58s)]
*  Brody Stevens. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5108.339999999999s)]
*  Those are just a few. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5111.62s)]
*  And there could be a bigger list. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5113.74s)]
*  I'm not good at thinking of them. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5115.0199999999995s)]
*  Malushi, all those guys. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5115.86s)]
*  You go further, right? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5117.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5118.78s)]
*  If you think about it, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5119.78s)]
*  if you make everybody happy but yourself, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5120.74s)]
*  I always tell people, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5122.66s)]
*  success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5124.099999999999s)]
*  And so you're starting to go, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5128.0599999999995s)]
*  look, I want to be fulfilled too. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5129.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't want to just be successful on the outside. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5130.78s)]
*  I want this to be inside me. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5133.14s)]
*  And you're on the path, brother. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5135.78s)]
*  The way you get on the path is you decide what you want. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5136.94s)]
*  And you begin to decide, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5139.42s)]
*  I want more than what I had before. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5140.26s)]
*  Second step, you say, okay, there's a gap [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5141.82s)]
*  between where I am or where I want to be. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5144.7s)]
*  What's getting in the way? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5146.78s)]
*  Is it a fear I need to face? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5147.82s)]
*  Is it a habit? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5149.900000000001s)]
*  Is it an emotion? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5150.900000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5152.02s)]
*  Is it a skill I'm missing I need to get? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5152.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know how to do this. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5154.42s)]
*  Someone's got to show me so I can get better. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5155.26s)]
*  Once you have faced that, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5157.62s)]
*  you get a little plan together. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5159.74s)]
*  You start taking action, not a perfect plan. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5160.820000000001s)]
*  And then you got to slay your dragons. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5162.860000000001s)]
*  You got to make the change. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5164.22s)]
*  You got to, okay, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5165.14s)]
*  so I'm not going to do the drugs anymore. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5165.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to run instead. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5167.58s)]
*  And then you get momentum. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5169.14s)]
*  And you're starting to get momentum. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5170.860000000001s)]
*  So now the only thing puts the brake on your momentum [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5171.900000000001s)]
*  is those old emotional patterns. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5174.9400000000005s)]
*  So you got to go, that's not me. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5176.820000000001s)]
*  That's an old pattern. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5178.78s)]
*  F that. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5179.98s)]
*  Here's what I'm going to do now. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5180.86s)]
*  And here's the other part though. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5182.179999999999s)]
*  As long as you focus on yourself, you suffer. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5183.62s)]
*  See, suffering comes from focusing on you. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5186.94s)]
*  That's why contribution is so valuable [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5189.5s)]
*  because when you're doing something for others, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5193.139999999999s)]
*  you're not thinking about you [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5194.82s)]
*  unless you're trying to do it to get something. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5195.9s)]
*  Right, and a lot of people had to focus on themselves [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5197.38s)]
*  because it was a survival mechanism. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5199.219999999999s)]
*  Me too. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5200.86s)]
*  So they didn't have a choice. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5201.7s)]
*  That's right. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5202.54s)]
*  So some people, you don't even realize it. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5203.38s)]
*  Your whole life you might be focusing on yourself [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5204.3s)]
*  and you might think, well, I'm selfish, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5206.179999999999s)]
*  but some of that might be just old habits [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5207.14s)]
*  because you had to focus on yourself [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5209.700000000001s)]
*  to make sure you were okay. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5211.54s)]
*  That's right. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5212.660000000001s)]
*  But then what happens is we don't update our software. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5213.5s)]
*  It'd be like using one of those old, you know, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5215.34s)]
*  digital or not even digital phones. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5218.18s)]
*  You'd be like, what are you doing? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5219.9400000000005s)]
*  You an idiot? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5220.780000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, using a pencil. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5221.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what are you doing? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5222.4400000000005s)]
*  You're living the modern world. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5223.280000000001s)]
*  This guy's a pervert. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5224.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5224.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5225.780000000001s)]
*  But it's time to upgrade your software. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5226.62s)]
*  And that's what you're doing. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5229.900000000001s)]
*  You're upgrading your mental software. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5230.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and there's some law. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5232.02s)]
*  I think there's, yeah, there's a little bit of sense of loss [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5232.860000000001s)]
*  with letting go of the old software [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5235.42s)]
*  because it felt like home. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5236.82s)]
*  Yeah, exactly right. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5238.62s)]
*  And it's like, I'm old enough, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5239.58s)]
*  I had one of the first portable phones. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5240.98s)]
*  It was this Motorola phone. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5242.82s)]
*  You ever seen it? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5243.66s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5244.5s)]
*  It weighs like eight pounds. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5245.34s)]
*  It was like a buck a minute. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5246.179999999999s)]
*  It didn't charge for more than 20 minutes. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5247.58s)]
*  We just called the police too. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5249.7s)]
*  You know? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5251.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5252.0199999999995s)]
*  But I was so proud to have that phone. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5252.86s)]
*  Now, like, you know. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5254.0599999999995s)]
*  I meant Sting. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5254.9s)]
*  So I meant Sting, it would call him. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5255.74s)]
*  Was he in the police? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5257.099999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5258.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5258.9s)]
*  If you give the, if you give, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5259.719999999999s)]
*  if you've got a phone today, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5261.099999999999s)]
*  they'll give it to you for free as long as you got a contract [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5262.099999999999s)]
*  and you got everything on it. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5264.58s)]
*  You got a hundred thousand songs. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5265.82s)]
*  You got access to everything. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5267.46s)]
*  So why would you go back to the old cell? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5269.179999999999s)]
*  I kind of miss it. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5270.54s)]
*  Okay, well go get yourself on those phones. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5271.38s)]
*  You can go visit it. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5273.38s)]
*  Go put it in some part of your house [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5274.219999999999s)]
*  and go visit for a little while if you want to. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5275.58s)]
*  But after a while you get bored with it [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5277.259999999999s)]
*  and you'll move into the new stuff. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5278.9s)]
*  And that's what's happening for you, brother. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5280.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, once you evolve into something new, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5281.46s)]
*  yeah, once you make a change, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5282.94s)]
*  it really does feel good. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5284.0199999999995s)]
*  It's just hard to make it sometimes. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5284.94s)]
*  But I'll tell you, I'll tell you one more secret. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5286.139999999999s)]
*  For changes to last, it has to become your identity. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5288.7s)]
*  Let me explain. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5291.82s)]
*  We all have a way of defining ourselves to ourselves. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5292.82s)]
*  So for example, if you see Lance Armstrong, right? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5296.62s)]
*  He was the greatest biker of all time. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5298.9s)]
*  He gets told that he has cancer, not just cancer, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5301.0599999999995s)]
*  cancer in his lungs, cancer in his brain, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5304.099999999999s)]
*  and oh yeah, in your testicles. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5305.78s)]
*  Oh, by the way, I ride a bike for a living. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5307.22s)]
*  They told me he was gonna die. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5308.94s)]
*  But his core belief is I always find the way. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5310.46s)]
*  So he survived cancer. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5314.18s)]
*  Most people don't. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5315.62s)]
*  He also found a way to win no matter what. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5316.98s)]
*  He broke the rules to do it [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5318.7s)]
*  and that cost his brand and so forth. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5319.86s)]
*  But the same thing that made him healthy [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5321.9s)]
*  actually got him into trouble in the biking side. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5324.06s)]
*  Before he used drugs, he was still unbelievable, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5326.9400000000005s)]
*  one of the best in the world, and guess what? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5329.18s)]
*  He got there because of a belief. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5330.900000000001s)]
*  So you have to have a new identity. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5332.820000000001s)]
*  His identity is I find the way, made him healthy. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5334.5s)]
*  So think of it this way. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5337.06s)]
*  If I set the thermostat in this room that, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5338.780000000001s)]
*  I think it'll relate to this, let's say 68 degrees. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5340.860000000001s)]
*  All right? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5344.1s)]
*  And that's a metaphor for your comfort zone, your identity. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5344.9400000000005s)]
*  This is, you know, that's 68 degrees is how much, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5348.780000000001s)]
*  not much money I want, but you know what I'm used to. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5351.06s)]
*  68 degrees is what I'm used to in a relationship. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5353.7s)]
*  It's not what I want, but it's okay. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5355.9s)]
*  That's pretty good, it's what I know, you know? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5358.54s)]
*  So think about his comfort zone. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5360.139999999999s)]
*  Now if the temperature drops to 65, 64, 62, 59, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5361.3s)]
*  all of a sudden, the brain, the computer goes, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5366.5s)]
*  hey, you're a 68 degree or what are you doing at 59? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5369.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm sure you've experienced it, like this is bullshit. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5372.7s)]
*  And they're like, boom, suddenly the heaters kick on [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5374.78s)]
*  and you got drive and you go deal with it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5376.66s)]
*  You go lose the weight or you get off the drugs, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5378.22s)]
*  you do whatever it is. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5379.86s)]
*  But here's the part that most people don't understand. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5380.78s)]
*  Let's say you get back to where you were [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5383.22s)]
*  and now you get new momentum and you're doing better. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5384.740000000001s)]
*  You go to 69, 70, 80, 89, 99 degrees. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5386.900000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden the brain goes, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5391.740000000001s)]
*  what the hell are you doing up here? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5392.84s)]
*  You're a 68 degree, you're not a 99 degreeer. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5394.38s)]
*  And the first thing that happens is the heaters stop [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5396.900000000001s)]
*  and you stop growing. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5398.860000000001s)]
*  And then if that's not enough, the air conditioners kick on [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5400.42s)]
*  and you start to sabotage yourself [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5402.54s)]
*  till you get back to where you believe you are. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5403.9400000000005s)]
*  So cigarettes. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5405.860000000001s)]
*  If you used to smoke, right? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5407.9800000000005s)]
*  So if I came to you today and I offer you a cigarette, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5409.900000000001s)]
*  what would you say? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5411.740000000001s)]
*  No sir, nobody or nobody, no sir, no. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5412.58s)]
*  No sir, no sir, nobody, okay. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5415.34s)]
*  So why? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5417.18s)]
*  Because I don't want it. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5419.14s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5420.1s)]
*  Because I don't, it doesn't make me happy anymore. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5422.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5424.66s)]
*  Most people, you wouldn't say what brand is it. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5425.9s)]
*  You go no. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5429.3s)]
*  And the reason why is you're no longer a smoker, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5430.14s)]
*  it's not your identity. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5432.7s)]
*  If you thought you're a smoker, you might go, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5434.58s)]
*  well what brand is it? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5436.1s)]
*  Well maybe I'll have one, you know, do whatever it is, right? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5437.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like when people tell me, you know, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5439.34s)]
*  I'm on day four of not drinking or not smoking, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5440.74s)]
*  I go, why are you counting? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5443.179999999999s)]
*  So you can tell people how many days you last this time [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5444.74s)]
*  before you go back again. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5446.54s)]
*  It's like when you change your identity, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5448.099999999999s)]
*  I'm not one of those, you're not gonna do it anymore. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5449.9s)]
*  So you are in the midst of transforming your identity. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5453.66s)]
*  You're in the middle of it right now [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5456.98s)]
*  and you're doing a beautiful job. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5458.179999999999s)]
*  Again, blowing smoke, I'm not a bullshitter. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5459.62s)]
*  No thanks man, I appreciate it. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5461.099999999999s)]
*  No, but I hope you take it in because you need to own [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5461.94s)]
*  that on your own, your own instincts [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5464.86s)]
*  have led you to a place of real progress. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5467.38s)]
*  You're not there yet, not where you wanna be. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5469.7s)]
*  And by the way, when you get wherever there is, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5471.78s)]
*  it won't be enough, you'll wanna do more [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5473.34s)]
*  because we're all supposed to keep growing. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5474.7s)]
*  That's what makes us happy. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5475.94s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna keep learning, I think it's important. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5477.66s)]
*  And I like learning about why people feel certain ways. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5480.179999999999s)]
*  That is like, and so does a lot of our listeners. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5483.58s)]
*  It's important to a lot of us. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5486.82s)]
*  Yes, let me tell you why people feel that way. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5488.139999999999s)]
*  Because a lot of us, we don't get understanding. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5490.3s)]
*  Nobody kind of explains to you what's going on [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5491.9s)]
*  while you're feeling. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5494.3s)]
*  So it gets confusing, you know? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5495.3s)]
*  So like, yeah, I don't know that I'm changing [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5496.86s)]
*  and I'm feeling sad about, you know, or just that. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5500.38s)]
*  I don't know, some of the stuff. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5502.82s)]
*  But let me give you and your viewers three things. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5503.66s)]
*  Because what I spent decades. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5506.78s)]
*  You always have so many things there. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5508.099999999999s)]
*  I will say you got a lot of things there, but it's good. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5509.58s)]
*  I'm loving them. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5511.9s)]
*  I got decades of taking complex things [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5512.86s)]
*  that make them simple because complexity [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5515.219999999999s)]
*  is the enemy of execution. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5517.78s)]
*  If it's too complex, you don't do it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5518.9s)]
*  Right, that's exactly what I'm just saying. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5519.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's too complex. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5521.099999999999s)]
*  So let me give you three. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5521.94s)]
*  You can think about this for you and your viewers. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5523.139999999999s)]
*  Whatever you're feeling right now, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5525.219999999999s)]
*  whether you're pissed off or sad or frustrated [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5526.34s)]
*  or excited or passionate, whatever, it doesn't matter. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5528.26s)]
*  There's only three things that made you feel that way. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5530.46s)]
*  Three patterns. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5532.58s)]
*  The first pattern is what you're doing with your body. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5533.9800000000005s)]
*  So let me give you an example. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5536.34s)]
*  If I said there's a depressed person [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5537.82s)]
*  behind curtain number one over there [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5539.54s)]
*  and I'll give a $100,000 donation to your favorite charity, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5540.860000000001s)]
*  I bet you could describe them physically [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5544.1s)]
*  without seeing them. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5545.42s)]
*  Depressed person, where are their shoulders? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5546.34s)]
*  Probably down forward. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5548.38s)]
*  Where's their head? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5549.46s)]
*  Probably looking like probably maybe something like that. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5550.58s)]
*  That's right. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5553.3s)]
*  Are they talking loud or quiet? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5554.14s)]
*  They could be probably a little bit subdued maybe. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5557.06s)]
*  That's right. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5559.38s)]
*  Fast or slow? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5560.22s)]
*  Probably slow. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5562.02s)]
*  That's right. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5562.860000000001s)]
*  And when they're doing that, think about it. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5563.740000000001s)]
*  Why do you know that? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5565.66s)]
*  Because you've practiced this shit before. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5566.4800000000005s)]
*  We all have, right? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5567.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5568.16s)]
*  But if you take that same person [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5569.0s)]
*  and I do this over and over again [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5569.820000000001s)]
*  and you change what we call their physiology, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5571.14s)]
*  the way they move, the way they breathe, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5573.1s)]
*  they put their shoulders back, they breathe different, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5574.5s)]
*  it literally changes their biochemistry. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5576.58s)]
*  If you change that as a habit, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5578.860000000001s)]
*  you change the biochemistry on a regular basis [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5581.46s)]
*  better than a drug because you're not dependent [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5583.7s)]
*  on anything. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5585.86s)]
*  Second thing determines how you feel. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5586.7s)]
*  So think of- [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5587.7s)]
*  You're your own drug. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5588.54s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5589.36s)]
*  And you're the dealer and the user. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5590.2s)]
*  Exactly right. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5591.34s)]
*  So if you're excited, what's the body like? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5592.18s)]
*  Yeah, you're a little more pumped up. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5594.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5595.62s)]
*  Smiling. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5596.46s)]
*  Is your head up or down? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5597.3s)]
*  Up. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5598.14s)]
*  Yeah, where are your shoulders? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5598.96s)]
*  They're there, they're good. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5599.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're loose. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5600.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5601.7s)]
*  It's a different- [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5602.52s)]
*  They're doing what they want. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5603.36s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5604.2s)]
*  Is the voice monotone or does it have more variety to it? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5605.02s)]
*  Variety. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5607.46s)]
*  That's right, right? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5608.3s)]
*  So you think about that, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5609.14s)]
*  you're breathing more full or more shallow? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5610.22s)]
*  More full. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5612.7s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5613.54s)]
*  And the rest, it's more- [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5614.36s)]
*  Yeah, probably more shallow [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5616.0s)]
*  except for some occasional big ones [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5616.96s)]
*  to get you keep you down there. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5618.259999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5619.599999999999s)]
*  Well, you let it all out and it's deflate, right? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5620.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5622.28s)]
*  So we change your breathing, we change your movement, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5623.12s)]
*  change your posture, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5624.92s)]
*  and your entire biochemistry will change that fast. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5625.759999999999s)]
*  But people have habits how they use, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5628.5599999999995s)]
*  like there's 37 muscles in your face. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5629.92s)]
*  This is the largest area of unemployment in the country [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5632.9s)]
*  because people do the same facial expression over and over [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5635.28s)]
*  and they feel the same feelings over and over again. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5637.679999999999s)]
*  You change the body, you change it all. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5639.78s)]
*  Now the second thing you change is what you focus on. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5641.12s)]
*  So example I gave you, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5644.16s)]
*  if you're thinking about, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5646.2s)]
*  oh my God, they're not here, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5647.04s)]
*  they're in a car accident, you're a worrier. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5648.4s)]
*  If you think, they don't give a shit, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5650.76s)]
*  they did it again, you're gonna be pissed off. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5653.08s)]
*  So whatever you focus on, you feel, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5655.82s)]
*  even if it's not true, you will feel it. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5657.48s)]
*  And then the third one is the language you put to it [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5659.84s)]
*  because words change meaning. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5662.639999999999s)]
*  So if I said to you, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5664.0s)]
*  look, during the break we have some nutritious snacks, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5665.599999999999s)]
*  the audience goes, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5668.36s)]
*  oh, we got some delicious snacks. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5669.2s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5670.96s)]
*  Just one word change changes the biochemistry. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5672.0s)]
*  It's not the words other people say to you, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5674.96s)]
*  it's also the words you say to yourself [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5676.44s)]
*  that change your biochemistry. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5678.16s)]
*  And it's not just words, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5679.52s)]
*  there's certain phrases that change what you even perceive. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5681.2s)]
*  So I don't know if you've ever had this when you were a kid, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5684.2s)]
*  but I remember, I finally get to sit down and have dinner [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5686.36s)]
*  and I was responsible for all of making [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5689.96s)]
*  that they're doing it all. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5691.56s)]
*  And then my mom or dad would say, could you get the salt? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5692.6s)]
*  I don't know what the salt is. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5695.32s)]
*  And I'm not lying, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5697.6s)]
*  I don't know the exact GPS location of the salt. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5698.44s)]
*  I don't know what the salt is. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5700.56s)]
*  You know what the salt is in the kitchen, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5701.4s)]
*  go get the salt. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5702.36s)]
*  I know the salt. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5703.2s)]
*  You go get the salt. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5704.0199999999995s)]
*  Fine, oh my God, what am I saying? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5704.86s)]
*  I don't know what the salt is, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5705.7s)]
*  I don't know what the salt is. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5706.5199999999995s)]
*  It's over on the second shelf, I open it, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5707.879999999999s)]
*  I don't really look it. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5709.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the salt is, it's not here. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5710.679999999999s)]
*  My dad walks by, reaches right in front of my face [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5713.12s)]
*  and goes, what is this? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5715.24s)]
*  You ever had an experience like that? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5716.44s)]
*  So here's the question. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5717.759999999999s)]
*  Did your eyes see the salt? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5719.24s)]
*  No. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5720.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5721.4s)]
*  But your brain did allow you to perceive it [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5722.219999999999s)]
*  because you hypnotized yourself over and over again, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5723.759999999999s)]
*  telling the lie to yourself, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5726.32s)]
*  I don't know what the salt is, [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5727.36s)]
*  I don't know what the salt is, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5728.2s)]
*  and then you go home, a blind spot. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5731.4s)]
*  So when you tell me, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5732.879999999999s)]
*  but I don't want to lose those friends of mine [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5733.719999999999s)]
*  from the past that made me feel like shit, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5735.179999999999s)]
*  you do it over and over again, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5736.96s)]
*  you can't even see the other option. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5738.58s)]
*  That's why our language, our focus, and our physiology, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5740.5199999999995s)]
*  the three of them together control. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5744.08s)]
*  If you make a little change in your body, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5745.5599999999995s)]
*  you'll feel a little change in how you feel. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5747.799999999999s)]
*  But for example, sound. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5749.679999999999s)]
*  Do you like to sing when no one's around? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5751.839999999999s)]
*  Not that much, I'm not a great singer. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5754.2s)]
*  No, I'm not either, but when no one's around, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5755.879999999999s)]
*  like in the car, great songs, something like that? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5757.24s)]
*  Sometimes, yeah. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5758.839999999999s)]
*  So some people, most of us don't sing well. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5759.84s)]
*  So what happens? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5762.08s)]
*  We're in the car, we're singing, we're rocking, [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5762.92s)]
*  we're rapping, right? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5764.54s)]
*  You get the spotlight, you're still doing it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5765.38s)]
*  Look over at a car next to you, somebody's staring at you. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5767.4800000000005s)]
*  You pick up your cellphone, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5769.72s)]
*  act like you've been talking to somebody or some shit. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5770.56s)]
*  But what's happened is, it makes you feel good to sing [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5773.02s)]
*  because you're using parts of your body [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5776.04s)]
*  you don't normally use. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5777.68s)]
*  It lifts you emotionally. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5779.280000000001s)]
*  And so what happens is, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5781.02s)]
*  that's why even though you don't sound good, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5782.02s)]
*  people like to sing when no one's around. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5783.400000000001s)]
*  But when somebody's around, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5784.76s)]
*  they don't want to sing because they don't want to be judged. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5785.6s)]
*  So you can change your focus, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5787.76s)]
*  your language, and your physiology. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5789.54s)]
*  If you change all three, you make a radical change. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5791.320000000001s)]
*  So when we do like a seminar and you have the fire walk, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5793.6s)]
*  the fire walk's just a metaphor [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5796.320000000001s)]
*  for breaking through whatever stops you. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5797.52s)]
*  But when you're in front of 2,000 degree burning hot coals, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5799.52s)]
*  you have a state change. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5801.900000000001s)]
*  Like all day, you might have felt really good, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5802.76s)]
*  and they're like, oh, I can't do it, I can't do it, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5804.16s)]
*  I can't do it, I can't do it. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5805.0s)]
*  And I look at them and go, I couldn't do it either [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5805.84s)]
*  if I talk like this and put my shoulders like this. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5807.04s)]
*  I say, stand tall, put your shoulders back, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5809.14s)]
*  scream yes, yes, scream yes. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5810.96s)]
*  And I make these, yes, yes, I said go. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5812.72s)]
*  And then boom, the person who couldn't go, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5814.8s)]
*  10 seconds ago storms across the fire. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5817.0s)]
*  Because what we do is based on the state we're in. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5819.36s)]
*  And you can change your state by the way you move, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5821.68s)]
*  by what you focus on, and by the language you use. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5824.24s)]
*  Change all three radically again and again, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5826.26s)]
*  you change your life. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5828.04s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5828.88s)]
*  Tony, man, thank you so much [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5830.28s)]
*  for thinking about this stuff with us. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5831.24s)]
*  I know that you have, before you go, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5832.32s)]
*  I know you have a book that's coming out, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5834.44s)]
*  The Holy Grail, right? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5835.88s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5837.04s)]
*  Is it okay if we pivot to that for five minutes? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5837.88s)]
*  Sure, I'd love to. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5839.12s)]
*  Okay, so I know it's about finances, right? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5839.96s)]
*  And it's about the disparity in the world kind of? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5843.0s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5845.88s)]
*  I've written three financial books. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5847.4800000000005s)]
*  This is the third one of the trilogy. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5848.320000000001s)]
*  It's the final of the trilogy. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5849.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5851.08s)]
*  And the first one was Money Master the Game, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5851.92s)]
*  it's the most read, most successful financial book [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5853.280000000001s)]
*  of the last 23 years, I'm really proud of it. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5855.96s)]
*  But as time went by, I wrote that book [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5858.320000000001s)]
*  by interviewing 50 of the smartest [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5860.280000000001s)]
*  financial people in the world, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5862.16s)]
*  and saying how do I take this complex stuff, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5863.64s)]
*  make it so my billionaire clients love it, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5865.96s)]
*  but the average person can really use it. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5867.4800000000005s)]
*  And it shows you how to go from nothing [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5868.96s)]
*  to where you want to be. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5870.360000000001s)]
*  Then I wrote a book called Unshakable [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5871.84s)]
*  to prepare people for 2020. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5873.240000000001s)]
*  I didn't know it was going to be COVID, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5874.68s)]
*  but I knew there was going to be a giant market change. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5875.64s)]
*  Because you can predict that it's going to come. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5878.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't know when, but it's going to come, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5880.08s)]
*  and I want people prepared. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5881.280000000001s)]
*  And then now there's so many people unprepared [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5882.76s)]
*  for their financial future that they're in the hole. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5885.52s)]
*  And so in order to get where you want to go, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5888.64s)]
*  you need compounding. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5890.360000000001s)]
*  With a tiny amount of money compounding, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5891.4800000000005s)]
*  you can get wherever you want. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5893.360000000001s)]
*  Like, if you start when you're really young, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5894.200000000001s)]
*  you're 19, you have no overhead, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5896.96s)]
*  you save 300 bucks a month, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5899.4800000000005s)]
*  and you put it, let's say, on the stock market [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5900.4800000000005s)]
*  where it's an 8% return, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5902.320000000001s)]
*  you can go from 17 to 27. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5904.0s)]
*  You put very little money in, right? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5907.0s)]
*  3000 bucks a year, roughly. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5908.72s)]
*  But that money will grow over time [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5910.6s)]
*  to provide several million dollars [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5912.84s)]
*  if you stop at 27 years old. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5914.4800000000005s)]
*  You start at 28 and do it. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5916.44s)]
*  You've got to put money in until you're 65, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5918.84s)]
*  and you'll still have less money. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5920.64s)]
*  That's how compounding works. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5921.72s)]
*  So it doesn't make a lot. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5923.92s)]
*  But if you could compound with a higher rate of return [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5925.24s)]
*  without taking too much risk, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5928.52s)]
*  because if you take too much risk, you lose everything. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5930.52s)]
*  And is that higher rate of return still? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5932.28s)]
*  So it feels like there's not as much. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5933.759999999999s)]
*  It feels very risky these days. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5935.24s)]
*  Or it feels like the stock market, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5937.12s)]
*  like it's just a front-facing thing to the public [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5938.88s)]
*  where everything else is done behind the scenes. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5942.12s)]
*  I think that's what a lot of stuff starts to feel like. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5944.2s)]
*  Well, and there are some truth to that [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5946.32s)]
*  because there used to be 8,000 stocks, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5947.92s)]
*  now there's only 3,600. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5950.759999999999s)]
*  And most of them, like in the Russell 2000, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5952.4s)]
*  which is one of the young companies, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5954.48s)]
*  40% of them aren't even profitable. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5957.08s)]
*  When you look at what's called the S&P 500, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5958.92s)]
*  the list of the top 500 companies in the stock market there, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5960.68s)]
*  the S&P list, those are the best ones. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5963.280000000001s)]
*  There's about seven that represent about 80% of the profits [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5965.6s)]
*  of what's going on there. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5968.8s)]
*  So it's a very small number. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5970.04s)]
*  That has changed over time. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5971.76s)]
*  And we didn't use to, people used to, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5973.6s)]
*  in order to protect themselves, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5975.8s)]
*  if you went to financial planner, they'd say, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5977.4800000000005s)]
*  well, put this much in stocks and this much in bonds, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5979.0s)]
*  because there's something called correlation [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5981.64s)]
*  or non-correlation. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5983.6s)]
*  When things move in the same direction, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5984.96s)]
*  if you invest in both of them and they both go down, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5987.4800000000005s)]
*  you got nothing. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5990.16s)]
*  If they both go up, it's nice, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5991.0s)]
*  but when they go down, it's a problem. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5992.28s)]
*  So I met with this man, Ray Dalio. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5994.04s)]
*  Some of your viewers may have heard of him. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5996.12s)]
*  Ray Dalio? [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5997.5599999999995s)]
*  Ray Dalio, he's the greatest hedge fund investor in history. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=5998.4s)]
*  He manages almost $200 billion in business. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6000.92s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6003.96s)]
*  And I interviewed him 14 years ago and became good friends. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6004.8s)]
*  And I asked him a question one time. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6007.48s)]
*  This guy's a genius. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6008.64s)]
*  He literally manages money for countries [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6009.48s)]
*  and he's got the greatest track record. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6011.72s)]
*  Like 2008, when everybody, when the market went down, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6012.92s)]
*  whatever the 38%, whatever the number, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6015.04s)]
*  I forget the exact number, he was down 3%. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6016.8s)]
*  Damn right. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6019.12s)]
*  And by the end of the year, he made 9%. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6019.96s)]
*  Good job, Ray. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6021.88s)]
*  I mean, just brilliant guy. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6022.72s)]
*  So I asked Ray, I said, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6023.76s)]
*  what is the most important investment principle [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6025.4s)]
*  that the average person or a billionaire would want to know [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6027.84s)]
*  what's made you so successful? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6030.92s)]
*  The most important principle. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6032.28s)]
*  And he didn't even hesitate. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6034.4s)]
*  He goes, Tony, I spent 20 years to figure this out. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6035.24s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to tell you the answer. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6037.2s)]
*  And he said, it's called the Holy Grail, right? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6038.44s)]
*  He goes, the Holy Grail of investing [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6041.0s)]
*  is to find eight to 12 investments [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6043.44s)]
*  that are not correlated. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6046.56s)]
*  So let me explain. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6047.84s)]
*  Stocks are designed to go up and then bonds where they are. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6049.04s)]
*  If stocks go down, bonds usually go up. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6052.08s)]
*  But in 2020, they both went down. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6054.36s)]
*  2008, they both went down. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6056.4s)]
*  And so that doesn't always work. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6058.52s)]
*  And so you've got a lot of risk. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6060.16s)]
*  He said, the secret is if you can find eight to 12 [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6061.4s)]
*  investments that are not correlated, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6063.72s)]
*  you reduce your risk 80% and you increase your upside. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6066.04s)]
*  There is nothing on earth that's more important. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6069.56s)]
*  You can try to pick the right stock or the right bond [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6071.92s)]
*  or the right piece of real estate, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6074.08s)]
*  but you're going to be wrong. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6075.4s)]
*  You're going to try and do the right time, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6076.36s)]
*  you're going to be wrong. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6077.44s)]
*  One thing you can count on is reducing the risk [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6078.28s)]
*  so that you're right more often. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6080.92s)]
*  And he said that that reduces the risk by the most, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6081.96s)]
*  by eight to 12 investments? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6083.84s)]
*  Eight to 12 that are not correlated. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6085.36s)]
*  So what are some examples of just places [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6086.759999999999s)]
*  that things wouldn't be correlated? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6088.679999999999s)]
*  Well, that's why I wrote this book. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6089.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6090.599999999999s)]
*  Because the average person thinks, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6091.44s)]
*  okay, well I got stocks and bonds [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6092.759999999999s)]
*  and maybe a REITs or real estate. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6094.16s)]
*  The problem is even REITs often will go up and down [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6096.12s)]
*  with the stock market, right? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6098.04s)]
*  So I've been around a while. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6099.48s)]
*  I've worked with the best people in the world [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6101.32s)]
*  and I've done well financially. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6102.719999999999s)]
*  And so I get opportunities at times [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6105.2s)]
*  because I'm well aware of the fact that private equity, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6107.24s)]
*  private real estate, private credit [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6109.72s)]
*  are actually much bigger businesses. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6112.08s)]
*  For the last 35 years, here this for everybody. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6114.28s)]
*  For the last 35 years, private equity firms [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6117.8s)]
*  have done better than every stock market in the world [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6120.679999999999s)]
*  on average, better than average of all those. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6122.84s)]
*  So for example, the S&P 500, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6125.28s)]
*  the one that most people know in the United States [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6127.12s)]
*  that they will invest in. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6128.8s)]
*  If you put that, that's over the last 35 years [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6131.16s)]
*  has gone up 9.2% compounded on average per year. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6134.84s)]
*  So you put your money in and it keeps growing. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6138.6s)]
*  It's pretty nice. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6140.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're doing pretty swell, yeah. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6141.08s)]
*  But if you were average, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6141.92s)]
*  by the way, when I went to interview people for this, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6143.04s)]
*  I interviewed the 13 biggest private equity guys in the world [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6144.72s)]
*  that run $100 billion, right? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6147.6s)]
*  Who make more money than God, basically. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6149.8s)]
*  The smartest ones in the world. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6151.96s)]
*  So to find out what they're doing. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6153.360000000001s)]
*  Because these guys all make like 20% plus per year, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6154.4800000000005s)]
*  not 14 and a half. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6157.360000000001s)]
*  So 9.2 versus 14.2. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6158.64s)]
*  14.2 is the average private equity. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6161.400000000001s)]
*  These are not average. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6163.36s)]
*  That's 50% better per year to grow your finances on. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6165.24s)]
*  Let me put that into what people understand. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6169.2s)]
*  When you compound what that means. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6171.719999999999s)]
*  If you put a million dollars 35 years ago on the stock market, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6172.759999999999s)]
*  it's worth 26 million right now. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6175.24s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6176.679999999999s)]
*  But if you put a million dollars in private equity, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6178.12s)]
*  it's worth 129 million. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6179.759999999999s)]
*  Same money, same amount of time. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6181.5599999999995s)]
*  God. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6183.28s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like, so most people know, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6184.12s)]
*  they don't know that much. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6187.04s)]
*  But they know private equity does really well. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6188.5199999999995s)]
*  And one of the reasons is, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6190.24s)]
*  your money's tied up for five years. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6191.36s)]
*  So if the market goes up and down, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6192.88s)]
*  they don't have to go sell. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6193.92s)]
*  So when the market goes down, they buy, right? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6195.12s)]
*  And they buy a company, they build it up. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6196.88s)]
*  They make it more valuable [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6199.68s)]
*  and they sell it to another company or they take it public. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6200.72s)]
*  And when things are good, they sell them. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6202.72s)]
*  When things are not, they buy. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6204.32s)]
*  So they've got a lot of room. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6205.360000000001s)]
*  And they make money a lot of ways. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6207.08s)]
*  If you put your money into these firms, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6209.360000000001s)]
*  they get 2% of your money every year, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6210.96s)]
*  no matter what, for managing it. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6213.28s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6214.72s)]
*  When they make money or lose it. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6215.56s)]
*  So if they have a billion dollar fund, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6216.6s)]
*  they make 20 million a year for five years. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6218.0s)]
*  They have a hundred million dollars guaranteed [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6219.4800000000005s)]
*  before they open their mouth. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6221.0s)]
*  Then they get 20% of the upside if they help it to grow. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6223.200000000001s)]
*  It's not uncommon for these guys to go from a billion [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6226.0s)]
*  to two billion in five years. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6228.240000000001s)]
*  That means they make 20% of that additional billion. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6230.04s)]
*  They make another $200 million. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6232.0s)]
*  They make $300 million on what originally was a billion. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6233.240000000001s)]
*  So when you look at the Fords 400, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6236.0s)]
*  the richest people in the world, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6237.68s)]
*  and you say, are they tech guys? [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6238.88s)]
*  Are they real estate guys? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6240.160000000001s)]
*  No, the number one are financial services. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6241.04s)]
*  It's private equity. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6243.0s)]
*  So watch this. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6243.84s)]
*  This is mind boggling. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6244.660000000001s)]
*  Because this sounds like it's all for rich people. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6245.5s)]
*  That's why I want to tell you. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6247.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, I'm just saying that. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6248.240000000001s)]
*  So, no, and you're right. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6249.080000000001s)]
*  And it has been. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6250.0s)]
*  But here's what's changed. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6251.160000000001s)]
*  Congress, the House just passed a law, bipartisan, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6252.92s)]
*  that said the richest people in the world [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6256.36s)]
*  having access to this is not fair. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6258.96s)]
*  And the argument has been, well, it's more sophisticated. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6261.8s)]
*  Well, they came up with a way to do it, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6263.92s)]
*  which is you made a minimum amount of money [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6265.599999999999s)]
*  building a business. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6267.96s)]
*  You don't know about investing, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6268.84s)]
*  but you get to make these investments if you can get in. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6270.24s)]
*  They passed a law that now says, and now the House has done [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6273.0s)]
*  it, the Christmas vacations just come, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6275.48s)]
*  they're coming back and they're going to vote in the Senate. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6277.599999999999s)]
*  It looks like it's going to pass there as well. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6279.16s)]
*  You can take a test. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6280.8s)]
*  I can show you a study for it. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6281.68s)]
*  You pass the test and you get access to these things. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6283.16s)]
*  But there's another problem, access. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6285.240000000001s)]
*  Because it's like buying an exotic car. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6288.4800000000005s)]
*  If you got like one of the new Ferraris, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6290.4800000000005s)]
*  not a standard one, one of the high-end Ferraris, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6293.360000000001s)]
*  there's a line of people waiting [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6296.84s)]
*  to buy them all just like that. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6297.84s)]
*  So it's not enough that you have money. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6299.400000000001s)]
*  You've got to know the right people. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6300.4800000000005s)]
*  So these funds, as I got more money, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6301.52s)]
*  and I was more famous, I knew people, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6305.0s)]
*  I could get into some of these funds, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6307.200000000001s)]
*  but I could get a sliver. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6308.200000000001s)]
*  Some I couldn't even get in. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6309.280000000001s)]
*  They were already sold out. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6310.12s)]
*  I was so frustrated. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6311.28s)]
*  So one day I'm talking to my friend Paul Tudor Jones, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6312.12s)]
*  who's a partner that broke off [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6314.44s)]
*  and started his own business. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6316.16s)]
*  I'm basically saying, this is so frustrating [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6317.0s)]
*  because these opportunities are so huge. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6319.32s)]
*  I've got resources, but I can't even get in. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6322.0s)]
*  He said, Tony, I'm going to tell you a little secret. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6324.56s)]
*  I'll tell you where I put most of my money. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6326.08s)]
*  And I'm leaning forward because this is a big, big player. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6328.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, get this level, huh? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6330.88s)]
*  Tell me what it is. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6332.64s)]
*  He goes, there's this company in Texas [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6334.2s)]
*  that does something really unique. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6335.92s)]
*  There's a few, but they're the best I've seen. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6337.12s)]
*  I said, Texas? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6338.6s)]
*  Normally you hear Singapore, London, New York, right? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6339.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6342.56s)]
*  Connecticut. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6343.400000000001s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6344.24s)]
*  He said, Tony, you don't have to fight [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6345.08s)]
*  to become an investor in one of those funds. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6347.360000000001s)]
*  He said, when you are an investor in a private equity, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6350.04s)]
*  they call you a limited partner. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6352.76s)]
*  That's the legal name they use for it. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6354.400000000001s)]
*  The owner of the fund. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6356.280000000001s)]
*  And private equity, just explain what it is really fast. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6357.6s)]
*  It's buying companies that are not public, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6360.24s)]
*  which is most companies. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6363.64s)]
*  And you build it, they put money in it. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6365.12s)]
*  They bring in new CEO. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6367.320000000001s)]
*  They build the new team. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6368.4400000000005s)]
*  They do new marketing. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6370.04s)]
*  They make the company stronger and they sell it. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6370.879999999999s)]
*  When you sell a business, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6372.5199999999995s)]
*  you get a multiple on the profits. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6373.36s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6374.92s)]
*  So you're investing in those sorts of things. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6375.759999999999s)]
*  That's private equity. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6377.28s)]
*  That's right. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6378.12s)]
*  And they have funds that invest over a period of time. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6378.96s)]
*  And they do that. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6380.4s)]
*  But they're not open to the public. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6381.24s)]
*  Well, they're open to the public, [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6382.599999999999s)]
*  but usually they're gone. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6383.759999999999s)]
*  If they're really good. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6384.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, they're really gone. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6385.599999999999s)]
*  They're gone right away, right? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6386.44s)]
*  So he says to me, he goes, Tony, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6388.12s)]
*  you can become an owner in the business itself [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6391.0s)]
*  and all those funds, not just own a fund, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6393.28s)]
*  and you can get the same two and 20. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6396.44s)]
*  Like you earn the 2% and 20. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6398.12s)]
*  You'll make about 10% on your investment per year [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6400.44s)]
*  as an owner. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6403.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6404.36s)]
*  And you get all the funds, past, present, and future. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6405.2s)]
*  The ones they did was low inflation, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6407.16s)]
*  the ones at high inflation, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6408.599999999999s)]
*  the future ones they want to do. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6409.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, how do you do that? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6410.76s)]
*  He goes, I'm gonna introduce you to these guys called Caz. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6413.12s)]
*  C-A-Z, they're based out of Houston. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6415.08s)]
*  So I meet this guy. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6416.5199999999995s)]
*  It turns out 25 years ago, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6418.08s)]
*  he started his career using my stuff [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6419.28s)]
*  and started this business. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6420.64s)]
*  He's been incredibly successful. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6421.5199999999995s)]
*  He's one of the biggest. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6423.36s)]
*  It's called GP Stakes. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6424.2s)]
*  You own a general partnership stake. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6425.2s)]
*  You're an owner. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6427.24s)]
*  You get the benefit of an owner and you own all the funds. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6428.28s)]
*  So I now own a piece of 65 different funds. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6431.2s)]
*  They're not little funds. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6434.32s)]
*  They're not billion dollar funds. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6435.16s)]
*  They're 100 billion funds like VISTA. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6436.16s)]
*  They have 100 billion dollars. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6437.8s)]
*  And they're growing like weeds. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6439.28s)]
*  And I get huge income like I'm an owner [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6440.679999999999s)]
*  and I get the upside like an owner [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6444.0s)]
*  and I get what an investor would get all the same. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6446.2s)]
*  And then you say, well, why would they do that? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6448.32s)]
*  Are they wanting to retire? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6450.32s)]
*  No. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6451.44s)]
*  Years ago, they used to just get companies [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6452.639999999999s)]
*  and try to leverage them and sell them for pieces. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6454.92s)]
*  That's old business. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6457.36s)]
*  Nobody does that anymore. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6458.2s)]
*  They build them. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6459.04s)]
*  But they have to put their own money in too. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6460.12s)]
*  So investors go, if you're on the line with me, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6461.88s)]
*  I'm gonna invest more. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6464.96s)]
*  So there's a company called Bain that after 2008, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6466.08s)]
*  when people were shaky, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6468.400000000001s)]
*  they said we're gonna raise $4 billion [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6469.76s)]
*  or we're gonna put 800 million of our own money in. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6471.72s)]
*  That's kind of the standard now. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6474.0s)]
*  So if you're putting money in, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6475.68s)]
*  you open a new fund every couple of years [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6476.76s)]
*  and it's tied up for five years, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6479.16s)]
*  your cash flow can be tight. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6480.6s)]
*  So they want more money to keep growing. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6481.72s)]
*  So if you know the right people, you can do things. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6484.04s)]
*  So now I'm a part of that, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6485.8s)]
*  but anyone can become a part of that. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6486.8s)]
*  Ignorance is not bliss, right? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6489.28s)]
*  Ignorance is poverty. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6490.56s)]
*  Knowing this changes the game. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6491.8s)]
*  I'll give you another one. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6493.28s)]
*  So people can learn that in this book though? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6494.48s)]
*  Yeah, I explain exactly how to do it. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6495.88s)]
*  And then another one, like all these rings. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6497.44s)]
*  For years, I wanted to be a professional athlete. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6499.36s)]
*  I wasn't good enough. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6502.56s)]
*  So it didn't work out well. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6503.4s)]
*  But then I was like, wow, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6505.28s)]
*  I got to work with all these athletes and turn them around [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6506.16s)]
*  so the best in the world. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6508.28s)]
*  I get to visit with a guy like Tom Brady, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6510.16s)]
*  go work with all these guys, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6511.72s)]
*  see what they're like and what they're doing. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6513.48s)]
*  Well, I started turning these teams around [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6515.32s)]
*  and I started getting the championship rings [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6517.48s)]
*  that I would have, but I've got them here from hockey. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6520.04s)]
*  I've got them here from NBA. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6521.919999999999s)]
*  I've got them here from all these guys. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6523.16s)]
*  Kind of like your dreams came true in this alternate way. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6524.0s)]
*  In a whole different way. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6526.0s)]
*  I mean, how many people like Michael Jordan, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6526.839999999999s)]
*  a few other people have six MVP rings? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6528.32s)]
*  I got to believe on that. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6531.36s)]
*  Who has six rings, Ian, anyway? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6532.2s)]
*  Especially if it's a man, you know? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6533.5599999999995s)]
*  Unless they're Italian. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6535.0s)]
*  If it's a man. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6535.839999999999s)]
*  You know, unless they're 100% Italian. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6536.679999999999s)]
*  But they're cherishing me, but here's what I'm gonna tell you. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6538.919999999999s)]
*  So then I was like, I want to own a sports team. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6540.8s)]
*  You know, I finally got enough money to participate [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6543.76s)]
*  and I finally, you know, then they take a microscope [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6545.96s)]
*  to you for a year to do it. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6549.360000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6550.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I helped build the LAFC football club. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6551.320000000001s)]
*  I was one of the original investors in it. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6553.320000000001s)]
*  It was great. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6554.64s)]
*  But now there's a new rule that's come about [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6555.72s)]
*  in the last couple of years. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6557.4400000000005s)]
*  It's specialized. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6558.92s)]
*  And it allows you to buy a piece, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6560.360000000001s)]
*  even a tiny piece of multiple sports teams and be an owner. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6562.52s)]
*  And the reason you want to do it is this. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6567.320000000001s)]
*  Sports is not tied to the stock market. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6569.12s)]
*  It's non-correlated. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6571.24s)]
*  The stock market goes up or down, doesn't affect sports. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6572.36s)]
*  Sports have done well during recessions, depressions, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6575.36s)]
*  player strikes, COVID, everything. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6577.68s)]
*  They've still done well. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6579.8s)]
*  The return from major league baseball, from the NHL, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6581.04s)]
*  from the NBA, from soccer, those four spots [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6585.2s)]
*  has averaged at 18% a year in the last 10 years. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6588.4s)]
*  So it's twice as much as the stock market, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6592.48s)]
*  to give you an idea. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6594.48s)]
*  And it's fun, but here's the best part. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6595.64s)]
*  They're no longer just putting butts in seats [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6598.52s)]
*  and they have a legal monopoly. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6600.8s)]
*  They own that city. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6602.76s)]
*  No one else can compete with them. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6604.200000000001s)]
*  And their fans, the word fan comes from fanatics. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6605.88s)]
*  Their customers are fanatics, multiple generations. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6608.92s)]
*  So my friend, Peter Goober, he bought the Dodgers [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6612.240000000001s)]
*  with my other friend, Magic Johnson, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6614.76s)]
*  and a group of other people. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6616.400000000001s)]
*  And no one had paid, he paid $2 billion [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6617.8s)]
*  to the LA Dodgers, $2 billion. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6620.12s)]
*  No one had paid a billion for a team yet. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6621.4400000000005s)]
*  And everybody said, it should have been a billion, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6623.88s)]
*  overpaid by a billion. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6625.76s)]
*  So I went to Peter and I said, Peter, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6626.84s)]
*  I know you're no dummy, he's my partner in business, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6628.400000000001s)]
*  we own sports team together, LAFC. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6630.16s)]
*  And I said, you gotta tell me the secret, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6632.52s)]
*  because I know you're not dumb. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6634.64s)]
*  You're not gonna overpay by a billion dollars. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6635.88s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6637.72s)]
*  He says to me, he goes, Tony, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6638.56s)]
*  he's made 52 Academy Award-made movies, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6640.4800000000005s)]
*  he's a total genius. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6642.68s)]
*  So he said, you know I'm not dumb, you're right. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6644.12s)]
*  He goes, how are you, what? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6646.0s)]
*  I wanna leave you in suspense. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6647.84s)]
*  I'm gonna make an announcement in two days, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6649.0s)]
*  then you call me, come on over and we'll laugh together. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6650.4400000000005s)]
*  So sure enough, two days later, they announce, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6652.96s)]
*  he paid two billion for the team, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6655.56s)]
*  he sold the local TV rights for $7 billion [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6657.88s)]
*  and made five billion instantly. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6661.280000000001s)]
*  No way. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6663.52s)]
*  Then- Just for the soccer? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6664.360000000001s)]
*  No, that's for football. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6666.080000000001s)]
*  I mean, excuse me, for the LA Dodgers. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6666.92s)]
*  Oh, for the Dodgers, he sold the rights. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6668.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so seven billion. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6669.4400000000005s)]
*  Now you also, when you own a sports team, [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6670.96s)]
*  the NBA, MLB, Major League Baseball, whatever, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6672.64s)]
*  you get a piece of the ad revenue for every single team. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6675.96s)]
*  Doesn't matter if you're big or small. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6679.6s)]
*  So his local rights alone made him five billion. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6680.84s)]
*  So you probably saw the gentleman he just brought on. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6683.8s)]
*  Shea Otani. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6686.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6687.4400000000005s)]
*  Shea Hay, is that his name? [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6688.28s)]
*  Sho Hei. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6689.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6690.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm Sho, Sho. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6691.28s)]
*  The amount of money- Sho Re. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6692.76s)]
*  The amount of money he's being paid [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6694.2s)]
*  is more than anybody in history. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6695.360000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6696.64s)]
*  And how are they doing it? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6697.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, they're doing it because they know [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6698.320000000001s)]
*  that the ad revenue they get from Japanese advertising [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6700.320000000001s)]
*  and so forth will pay at times many more. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6703.04s)]
*  Do you know if you watch television today [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6705.6s)]
*  because of cord cutting, nobody wants to watch commercials. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6707.12s)]
*  So 92 of the last 100 top shows are sports [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6709.56s)]
*  because you don't have, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6713.56s)]
*  think about making a film for Netflix like a series. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6715.080000000001s)]
*  You got to pay actors. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6717.360000000001s)]
*  Nightmare. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6718.200000000001s)]
*  All that's got to be, you set up your cameras, you shoot. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6719.280000000001s)]
*  It's cheap to do. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6721.400000000001s)]
*  And people are willing to watch because it's live. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6722.8s)]
*  And then they'll watch the ads, just like Superbowl, right? [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6725.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6727.200000000001s)]
*  They watch all the ads. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6728.04s)]
*  So that business, and they buy the real estate around it. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6728.88s)]
*  They become media moguls. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6731.76s)]
*  So now I own the Warriors. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6734.04s)]
*  I own the Dodgers. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6735.96s)]
*  I own the Red Sox. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6736.8s)]
*  I own the Pittsburgh Penguins. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6737.8s)]
*  Because you have a piece in what? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6739.160000000001s)]
*  Which I teach in this book. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6741.280000000001s)]
*  It's a piece of these different businesses, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6742.52s)]
*  these sports businesses, and it's non-correlated. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6745.280000000001s)]
*  And people can get into that. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6747.56s)]
*  Shows you how to do it. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6749.040000000001s)]
*  And you can do a tiny amount, small amounts. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6749.96s)]
*  I'll give you one last one. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6751.8s)]
*  Bonds, you're probably not very familiar [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6753.6s)]
*  because you haven't done a lot of this yet. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6755.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah, that caught him. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6756.320000000001s)]
*  What did he do? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6757.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, not only did he do bonds. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6760.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, what are you talking about? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6760.96s)]
*  No, I'm talking about stocks and bonds. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6761.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6763.52s)]
*  Yes, no problem. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6764.360000000001s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6765.200000000001s)]
*  But bonds for years, because of low interest rates, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6766.02s)]
*  have given you no return. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6769.4400000000005s)]
*  So people are taking bigger and bigger risks. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6770.8s)]
*  So back in 2021, you're making no money. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6772.56s)]
*  So there's a type of bond that is not very stable. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6776.2s)]
*  It's very risky. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6779.04s)]
*  And they call them high-yield bonds. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6780.320000000001s)]
*  They're actually called junk bonds [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6781.72s)]
*  because they're very risky. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6783.2s)]
*  They were paying 3.9% in 2021 [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6784.84s)]
*  before the interest rates rise. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6787.84s)]
*  And people were buying them [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6789.400000000001s)]
*  because there was no other place to get income. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6790.92s)]
*  I was making 9% on private credit. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6793.6s)]
*  What is private credit? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6796.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6797.16s)]
*  Banks don't loan to a lot of people. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6797.98s)]
*  Really high-end businesses, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6800.94s)]
*  100 million to $3 billion businesses need money to grow. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6802.259999999999s)]
*  Well, where do they go? [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6806.0s)]
*  They go to private credit. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6807.0199999999995s)]
*  Now these organizations now loan you money. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6808.0199999999995s)]
*  And they usually loaned it just a few years ago, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6810.179999999999s)]
*  like 5%, 6% for a loan. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6812.74s)]
*  So banks are borrowing money from people? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6815.099999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6817.259999999999s)]
*  Companies need to borrow money from banks, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6818.099999999999s)]
*  and banks don't do it. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6819.82s)]
*  And Apple will get their money, somebody like that. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6820.66s)]
*  Right, but a lot of businesses won't. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6822.54s)]
*  There's 200,000 businesses in the United States [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6823.94s)]
*  between 100 million and 3 billion, to give you an idea. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6825.94s)]
*  Gigantic. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6828.54s)]
*  They need money. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6829.58s)]
*  So there's become a new market. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6830.639999999999s)]
*  It's these private equity guys loaning them money, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6832.299999999999s)]
*  but they put their own money in it. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6834.7s)]
*  So they don't sell the loan off. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6836.0199999999995s)]
*  So they are really picky about who they put in. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6837.719999999999s)]
*  They build good long-term relationships. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6839.82s)]
*  They have less than a 1% failure rate. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6842.12s)]
*  No bank on earth has that. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6844.0s)]
*  They'd be dreaming about that. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6845.259999999999s)]
*  I'll give you another example [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6849.0599999999995s)]
*  that maybe your audience can relate to. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6849.9s)]
*  If you had a house and you had a mortgage that was fixed, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6850.98s)]
*  when interest rates went up, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6854.58s)]
*  you don't care. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6856.1s)]
*  It's only 3%. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6856.94s)]
*  But when you have a loan on a business, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6858.38s)]
*  it's usually a floating rate. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6860.42s)]
*  So when interest rates go, it rises up. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6862.0199999999995s)]
*  So those same private credit firms [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6864.6s)]
*  that loaned you money at 3.5%, guess what? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6866.06s)]
*  Excuse me, 5% or 6%. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6869.58s)]
*  Now it's 11% plus. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6870.94s)]
*  The same loan with the same company, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6872.58s)]
*  and you're making twice or three times [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6874.9s)]
*  as much money as before. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6876.78s)]
*  So when people are taking risks to 3.9%, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6878.0199999999995s)]
*  I've got a 1% failure rate, and I'm making 9%. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6880.34s)]
*  Now I'm in the high teens on my private credit. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6883.06s)]
*  And I own those firms. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6885.780000000001s)]
*  So I also get the 2%, I get the 20%, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6887.72s)]
*  and I get the upside on those pieces. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6891.080000000001s)]
*  So those are just three examples. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6893.1s)]
*  I give you seven examples of industries that you can do [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6894.46s)]
*  and show you exactly how to do it. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6898.22s)]
*  And then the second half of the book [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6899.540000000001s)]
*  is these 13 masters of the universe. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6900.860000000001s)]
*  These guys that, like Robert Smith who runs Vista, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6903.780000000001s)]
*  it's a famous firm, $100 billion in business. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6908.34s)]
*  He started with nothing. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6910.580000000001s)]
*  He's the wealthiest African-American in the United States. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6913.78s)]
*  Genius of man, I love this man. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6915.58s)]
*  Oh hell yeah, that's cool. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6917.0199999999995s)]
*  And he focuses on one industry [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6917.86s)]
*  in software as a service called SaaS. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6921.299999999999s)]
*  But he knows it so well that he can take a company. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6923.46s)]
*  He already knows what to do with the CEO, [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6925.7s)]
*  what to do, how to grow it. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6927.46s)]
*  He grows it rapidly, he's got his whole system for doing it. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6928.74s)]
*  He grows the business and then he sells it [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6931.94s)]
*  to a bigger company or takes it public. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6933.839999999999s)]
*  His returns, I can't quote his returns [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6936.259999999999s)]
*  because you have to ask him about it, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6937.86s)]
*  but they're all above 20% for decades. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6939.32s)]
*  So think about what that would do to your financial future. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6942.98s)]
*  What would it take in say 10 years to double [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6945.259999999999s)]
*  you can do in three years? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6947.179999999999s)]
*  And so this isn't the only thing you do, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6948.62s)]
*  but it's one of the most important things [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6951.099999999999s)]
*  that most people know about [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6952.54s)]
*  and it was never available before. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6953.58s)]
*  Now it's available. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6955.54s)]
*  So you're saying because of the new legislation [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6956.379999999999s)]
*  a lot of this stuff is available. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6958.179999999999s)]
*  That's correct. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6959.419999999999s)]
*  And is there downside to it? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6960.259999999999s)]
*  I mean there's risk with everything. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6961.74s)]
*  That's right, well least amount of risk [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6963.099999999999s)]
*  compared to bonds less. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6964.98s)]
*  But then the second, other than say treasuries, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6966.419999999999s)]
*  on the private equity side, again, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6968.7s)]
*  since they have your money for a longer period [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6971.02s)]
*  you get a lot larger return, but there's less risk. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6972.700000000001s)]
*  The reason there's less risk is because [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6976.26s)]
*  when things drop in the stock market [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6977.700000000001s)]
*  they don't have to sell. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6979.02s)]
*  They go buy then, right? [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6980.02s)]
*  When things are up they go sell then. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6981.820000000001s)]
*  So they have more room to play within time [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6983.76s)]
*  instead of oh my God, what are you gonna do this quarter? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6986.14s)]
*  Where are you gonna get the stock up this day? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6987.620000000001s)]
*  They don't have to do that. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6988.9800000000005s)]
*  It allows them to make better decisions. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6989.820000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6991.580000000001s)]
*  My last three books I've done this, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6995.18s)]
*  they've given 100% of all the profits in the book [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6996.38s)]
*  go to Feeding America. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=6999.1s)]
*  So while you're helping yourself, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7000.4s)]
*  you help people that are really in need as well. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7001.719999999999s)]
*  Same for this one, the profits are going to that? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7003.32s)]
*  Oh that's amazing man, thank you. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7005.16s)]
*  That's cool man, I eat. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7007.36s)]
*  You know, so I know we're all grateful for that. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7009.44s)]
*  Can I get a copy of the book too? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7013.24s)]
*  Of course. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7014.48s)]
*  Oh that's sweet man. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7015.32s)]
*  Yeah of course. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7016.16s)]
*  There's like, this is my last question. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7017.339999999999s)]
*  So there is, we're kind of at a time in the world [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7018.96s)]
*  where I think a lot of people are under a little bit, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7022.719999999999s)]
*  it's a precarious time it feels like, right? [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7026.36s)]
*  A lot of uncertainty. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7028.48s)]
*  A lot of uncertainty. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7029.32s)]
*  Some of that may be media influence, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7030.92s)]
*  some of it may not, we don't know, [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7032.44s)]
*  but there's just a lot going on. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7033.599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7035.4s)]
*  And it used to feel like you could leave the world [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7036.72s)]
*  a better place, right? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7039.92s)]
*  It used to be something that I think gave people [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7040.92s)]
*  a lot of purpose, right? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7043.36s)]
*  Like I want to leave the world a better place. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7044.84s)]
*  And I think now, there's sometimes feels like [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7047.4s)]
*  the world has gotten, it's flared up and we can't do that. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7052.96s)]
*  I'm not saying that's true, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7058.32s)]
*  but sometimes it feels like that. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7059.36s)]
*  And so I think that caused a lot of people to, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7060.68s)]
*  it really takes away a sense of purpose at a level, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7062.8s)]
*  probably an almost limbic or animal level [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7065.28s)]
*  that we don't even realize. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7068.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7070.2s)]
*  What can people do to combat that? [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7071.04s)]
*  The first thing I'd do is I would cut down [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7076.04s)]
*  my consumption of the news, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7077.64s)]
*  turn off all the things that go on your phone, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7079.0s)]
*  not to become a hermit or something, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7081.12s)]
*  but you got to remember that these people are good people. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7083.96s)]
*  They don't have bad intentions. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7086.08s)]
*  They don't have bad intent, but they have to do one thing. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7087.4s)]
*  They're doing their job. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7090.32s)]
*  Their job is make more money for the shareholders. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7091.16s)]
*  There's only one way to do that. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7093.32s)]
*  Get more of your eyeballs. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7094.44s)]
*  How do we get your eyeballs? [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7095.879999999999s)]
*  Upset you, anger you, produce fear. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7097.36s)]
*  If I do those things, we all know in journalism, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7099.799999999999s)]
*  they talk, if it bleeds, it leads. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7101.879999999999s)]
*  It used to be, again, a plane crashed in Nigeria. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7104.08s)]
*  You didn't know about it. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7107.08s)]
*  Now you know about it within seconds. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7107.92s)]
*  So there's actually, all the studies show [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7109.32s)]
*  there's less violence today, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7111.5199999999995s)]
*  but we see everything more magnified, right? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7112.879999999999s)]
*  We're also in a stage in history. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7116.28s)]
*  We go through stages. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7118.96s)]
*  I don't want to try to be complex, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7120.48s)]
*  explain the whole thing to you, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7122.32s)]
*  but if you study 1,000 years of Roman history, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7123.16s)]
*  500 years of Anglo-American history, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7125.599999999999s)]
*  we go through 18, 20-year cycles [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7127.5599999999995s)]
*  where we run an emotion as a culture as a whole. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7129.36s)]
*  Doesn't mean you're going to feel that way. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7132.48s)]
*  So in the springtime, everybody's optimistic. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7134.12s)]
*  I don't mean physical spring. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7136.04s)]
*  I mean that season, right? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7137.12s)]
*  And things grow and it's easy. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7139.36s)]
*  So after World War II, we went into springtime. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7140.599999999999s)]
*  Everybody's like, oh, thank God it's over. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7142.8s)]
*  Everybody had lots of sex. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7144.4s)]
*  That was the baby boom, right? [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7145.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7146.719999999999s)]
*  If you were a veteran, you were like, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7147.5599999999995s)]
*  you got to have a house for free, right? [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7149.919999999999s)]
*  No money down, nothing. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7151.44s)]
*  It was a cool time for a lot of people. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7152.679999999999s)]
*  Not everyone, but a lot of people. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7155.28s)]
*  The culture. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7156.839999999999s)]
*  But then from 1945 to 1963, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7157.839999999999s)]
*  in 63, we're the height of optimism. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7160.5199999999995s)]
*  Kennedy's the president, John F. Kennedy, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7163.16s)]
*  and he gets assassinated. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7165.08s)]
*  And then Robert Kennedy, and then Martin Luther King. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7166.639999999999s)]
*  And what happens is we go through a summertime [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7169.879999999999s)]
*  where everything's tested [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7172.0s)]
*  and there's fighting within the country. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7173.08s)]
*  It's called summer. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7175.48s)]
*  It's like it happens every 80 years, like clockwork. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7176.32s)]
*  I can take you. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7178.8s)]
*  There's a really cool book. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7179.64s)]
*  This is the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7181.08s)]
*  is that it? That's it, that's it. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7182.88s)]
*  You guys have got it. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7183.8s)]
*  So if you read Strauss-Howe about generational theory, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7184.64s)]
*  there's a book called The Fourth Turning. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7187.08s)]
*  I interviewed these guys. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7189.4s)]
*  Fourth Turning? Fourth Turning. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7190.24s)]
*  It's a book worth reading [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7192.2s)]
*  because you'll be reading about how life is, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7193.52s)]
*  and it's like right now, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7195.84s)]
*  and then they reveal that it's from 80 years ago [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7196.96s)]
*  from the New York Times. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7199.2s)]
*  And then you read another one, it's from 160 years ago, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7200.04s)]
*  and you're like, this is crazy. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7202.52s)]
*  So it's a cycle that we go through. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7204.68s)]
*  So after we're done with the optimism, we get burnt out. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7206.56s)]
*  We go through the summer of tests and upset, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7208.8s)]
*  then we have another good time. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7210.92s)]
*  We have fall where everything's easy. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7211.92s)]
*  You want a house, you have no money, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7213.4800000000005s)]
*  we'll give you a loan. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7214.76s)]
*  Right? Yeah, my buddy. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7215.6s)]
*  Easy, easy money, right? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7216.56s)]
*  And everything's easy. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7218.240000000001s)]
*  Then that's always followed by a winter. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7219.6s)]
*  Now, some winters are long, some are short, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7221.76s)]
*  some are hard, some are relatively easy, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7224.08s)]
*  but you never go from fall to spring. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7225.72s)]
*  You've got to go through winter, right? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7227.8s)]
*  We're in winter right now. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7229.320000000001s)]
*  So think about it. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7230.64s)]
*  The people that were grown up in, try this for size. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7231.52s)]
*  Most people don't study their history, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7235.400000000001s)]
*  but just take this for a second. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7236.68s)]
*  If you were born in like 1910, what did that mean? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7238.040000000001s)]
*  Well, World War I was going on while you were growing up. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7240.92s)]
*  So you were protected. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7243.56s)]
*  You didn't go to war, you didn't have to face it. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7244.64s)]
*  Your family looked out for you. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7246.320000000001s)]
*  It had been a tough time, but you made it through it, [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7247.8s)]
*  and we won the war and came home. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7249.280000000001s)]
*  Right around that time, like now, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7251.320000000001s)]
*  there's a massive technology breakthrough, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7252.6s)]
*  like we're experiencing with AI and so forth. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7254.52s)]
*  What happened? [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7256.52s)]
*  We went from nothing to radios, televisions, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7257.6s)]
*  cars, planes, like, and the roaring 20s. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7260.2s)]
*  So if you're growing up and you're in that zero to 21, [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7264.5599999999995s)]
*  you were born in 1910, you're thinking, [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7267.04s)]
*  when I'm 1920, I'm getting a car, I'm going to party. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7268.88s)]
*  And the kids then were looked down on. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7271.76s)]
*  They're called flappers, because they were irresponsible. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7273.28s)]
*  Very much like older generations often talk about [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7276.16s)]
*  millennials or C generation, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7278.12s)]
*  because millennials and generation are great people, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7279.92s)]
*  but they haven't faced anything really big. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7281.76s)]
*  They think violence is words, right? [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7283.639999999999s)]
*  Chris Rock says, if you think violence is words, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7285.76s)]
*  no one slapped the shit out of you on national television. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7287.4s)]
*  That's violence. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7289.44s)]
*  That's a different thing, right? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7291.24s)]
*  But you've never experienced anything, [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7292.879999999999s)]
*  you think that's pain, is that your idea of pain, right? [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7294.5599999999995s)]
*  So they're right about that, but I have no worries. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7297.04s)]
*  These are going to be the heroes. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7299.2s)]
*  Millennials and Zs are going to be heroes of the future. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7300.2s)]
*  Here's how I know it. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7301.92s)]
*  1910, when they turned 19, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7303.2s)]
*  and they thought they were going to go party, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7305.799999999999s)]
*  what happened? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7307.799999999999s)]
*  It was 1929 and the whole world was upside down. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7308.639999999999s)]
*  Suddenly people jumping out of buildings, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7310.839999999999s)]
*  standing in food lines, the Midwest is a dust bowl. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7312.28s)]
*  Stop market crash. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7314.679999999999s)]
*  Everything. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7315.799999999999s)]
*  So these people had to get tough. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7316.639999999999s)]
*  They were weak as shit, but they had to get tough [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7318.84s)]
*  because it was required to survive. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7320.6s)]
*  So by the way, they do 10 years of the Depression. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7322.8s)]
*  It's not bad every day. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7324.92s)]
*  There were some ups and downs, pretty rough times. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7326.04s)]
*  A lot of soup. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7328.24s)]
*  A lot of soup. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7329.08s)]
*  That's a good one. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7330.64s)]
*  But now they turned 29, it's 1939, [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7331.88s)]
*  and that's when World War II breaks out, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7334.2s)]
*  and you and I weren't alive then, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7335.72s)]
*  but Hitler was taking countries one after another. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7337.32s)]
*  It looks like we're going to lose. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7339.4800000000005s)]
*  They fought that war and won. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7341.2s)]
*  They became what's known as the great generation, [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7343.04s)]
*  the greatest generation, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7345.400000000001s)]
*  because they faced these difficult things. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7346.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, at the end of the winter, it's springtime. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7349.12s)]
*  At springtime, once we got through that, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7350.879999999999s)]
*  the wind threw a hot summer. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7352.879999999999s)]
*  Think of how the 60s and 70s are so different [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7354.08s)]
*  than the 80s, 90s, or 2000s. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7356.36s)]
*  And so we go through these cycles. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7358.799999999999s)]
*  So we're in winter right now, [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7360.48s)]
*  and winter makes it look much worse than it is, [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7361.759999999999s)]
*  but here's the good news about winter. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7364.32s)]
*  It's going to take that younger generation, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7365.959999999999s)]
*  and they're going to become heroes. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7367.759999999999s)]
*  They're smart, they're connected, they care, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7369.16s)]
*  but they're not as strong as they will be, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7372.5599999999995s)]
*  because they haven't, it's like lifting weights. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7374.2s)]
*  If you take a light weight and lift it, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7376.32s)]
*  I don't care how many, you do 100 curls, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7377.56s)]
*  you're not going to get anything. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7379.8s)]
*  You take a weight you can barely lift and do, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7381.080000000001s)]
*  you can only do eight curls, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7383.04s)]
*  and your trainer makes you do 11, [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7384.4800000000005s)]
*  and that 11th curl gives you 90% of the growth. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7386.68s)]
*  We're going to go through that experience, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7389.88s)]
*  we already are, to some extent, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7391.240000000001s)]
*  but what people need is to create a compelling future. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7393.280000000001s)]
*  They need to know that this went, no war is forever, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7395.320000000001s)]
*  no economy is forever, no pandemic or plandemic is covered. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7399.0s)]
*  Get addicted to the story, don't fall in, that's a trap. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7403.6s)]
*  That's right. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7406.04s)]
*  You also have to have a plan for yourself. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7406.88s)]
*  And you can see that, if you were the universe or God, [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7408.72s)]
*  after the night, you create the day. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7411.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7412.84s)]
*  You get bored of it. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7413.68s)]
*  That's what works, and that's what makes us grow. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7414.52s)]
*  And winter also gets rid of the weak and strong, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7416.96s)]
*  not only survive, but they find a way to thrive. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7419.68s)]
*  When you look at the biggest companies in the world, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7421.72s)]
*  called Fortune 1000, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7423.76s)]
*  80%, excuse me, 70% of them were developed [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7425.92s)]
*  during a recession or a depression. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7428.4400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7430.12s)]
*  Because when you do well then, [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7430.96s)]
*  you're going to do well during all the other seasons. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7432.76s)]
*  So if you start a business right now and it's hard, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7434.4s)]
*  but you do it well, [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7436.88s)]
*  like I started my business during the last really tough time, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7437.719999999999s)]
*  which was when interest rates were 18%. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7440.799999999999s)]
*  No, they were really that? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7443.4s)]
*  18%. You're lying. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7444.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not lying. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7445.96s)]
*  Today, people are freaking out, going 7%, [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7446.96s)]
*  oh my God, I can't get a house. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7449.92s)]
*  I bought my first house at 18 years old, it was 18%. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7451.839999999999s)]
*  You're not going to make any money at 18%. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7455.599999999999s)]
*  I lost money on the house, it was horrible, right? [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7457.32s)]
*  But that's what it was in those days. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7459.639999999999s)]
*  But I had to get strong. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7461.24s)]
*  And here I am 46 years later and I've done very well. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7462.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, a lot of other people started when it was easy [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7466.5199999999995s)]
*  and they're gone. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7468.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7469.36s)]
*  Wow, so that's good. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7470.719999999999s)]
*  It's a good way to look at it, man. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7471.839999999999s)]
*  I think it goes back to what we said in the meeting [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7472.879999999999s)]
*  to talk about perspective. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7474.28s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7476.04s)]
*  Like have a perspective. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7476.879999999999s)]
*  Have a bigger perspective. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7477.719999999999s)]
*  Have a bigger perspective of what's going on [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7479.5599999999995s)]
*  in your own life. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7481.48s)]
*  Man, I don't think there's anything else. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7483.48s)]
*  Do you guys think of anything? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7484.48s)]
*  I think we've spent a lot of your time too. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7485.639999999999s)]
*  I really enjoyed this, Theo. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7487.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7488.919999999999s)]
*  And listen, I loved your humor, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7489.759999999999s)]
*  but I really want to thank you for your vulnerability [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7491.04s)]

*  and you're leading by example. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7494.68s)]
*  I'm not being perfect. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7496.68s)]

*  But you're growing, brother. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7499.76s)]
*  And those emotions you felt, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7500.88s)]
*  you're going to feel those a lot less [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7503.08s)]
*  as you keep on this track. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7504.36s)]
*  Pretty soon, they won't be something you identify with. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7505.92s)]
*  It'll be like cigarettes. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7508.84s)]
*  You'll be like, by the way, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7509.76s)]
*  do you feel bad about the cigarettes [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7511.4400000000005s)]

*  Or use a Ouija board, [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7523.32s)]
*  like to talk to a pack of Wences or something, you know? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cvzW0m_ZU&t=7524.4800000000005s)]
