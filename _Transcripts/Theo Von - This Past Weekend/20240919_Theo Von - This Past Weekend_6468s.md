# Dr. Tara Swart  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #532
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4)
*  Today's guest is a woman I've been intrigued with for a while. She is a neuroscientist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=0.0s)]
*  She's an author and she's an advisor who focuses on how to get peak mental performance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=7.04s)]
*  She wrote a best-selling book called The Source, which is all about things you can do to be your [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=13.92s)]
*  best self. She's a fascinating woman and I'm grateful for our chat. Today's guest is Dr. Tara Swart. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=18.72s)]
*  Just so you know, all this air conditioning and ice is really playing havoc [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=30.0s)]
*  with my throat. Really? Yeah, because I'm not used to it. So, I mean, it's not. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=59.84s)]
*  Yeah, they don't have it in the UK, huh? No. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=63.52s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes, you know, I wonder, um, you know, I find sometimes there'll be, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=66.72s)]
*  I'll go on vacation and I'll stay in a place that doesn't have air con, you know? And it's kind of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=73.36s)]
*  cool because at first I'm like, this sucks. But then like, you feel a lot more connected to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=80.0s)]
*  Nate, like just the uni, I don't know what it is. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=86.56s)]
*  The environment. Yes. Minimum. Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=88.96s)]
*  You feel way more connected to the environment when you don't have air conditioning. You don't [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=90.72s)]
*  have all these kind of little comforts, you know? Because you're always kind of trying to balance [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  everything for the perfect amount of comfort. That's what I feel like I'm trying to do these [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  days. It's like, I'm always trying to, like, okay, the air conditioner, am I laying the right, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  like when I go to sleep specifically, it's like, am I laying the right way? Do I, it's like, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=106.88s)]
*  I have to have so many little things kind of perfectly lined up or everything's not going [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=110.88s)]
*  to be okay, you know? But do you do that thing where you blast the air conditioning, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=116.16s)]
*  but you sleep under loads of blankets and why? I don't get that. Why not just have the bedding [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=120.56s)]
*  that's correct for the temperature that it naturally is? Yeah, I think because people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=128.16s)]
*  have just gone rogue. People don't know how to just be, just people are just crazy like that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=132.56s)]
*  Really, they're really sleepopaths, I call them, because it's kind of crazy. But yeah, you're right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=139.76s)]
*  Like I'm going to put it at 65 degrees and I'm going to bundle up like it's, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=144.96s)]
*  like I'm in Antarctica. Exactly. Yeah. And then the craziest stuff is sometimes you'll see like, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=148.72s)]
*  some people have like a rain forest, they have an eye mask on. It literally seems like they're being, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  it's kind of the same thing as if you were being tortured in a country, like in a, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=160.08s)]
*  you know, it's like they've got eye masks, there's like water dripping in the back. It just, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  you're like, this is, this is what they used to do to prisoners, it seems like, you know? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=168.72s)]
*  Theo, I knew I was going to laugh with you, but I can't believe I've got the giggle psych already. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=173.76s)]
*  Do you really? Yeah. Oh, well damn. I like it. I like an eye mask personally, because I [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=178.16s)]
*  don't, can't tolerate any light when I'm sleeping. But when you said I have to be in the right [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=183.84s)]
*  position, do you actually know what the right position is according to a neuroscientist? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Uh-uh, for sleeping. And I'm here with neuroscientist Tara Swart. And you're that brain, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=192.0s)]
*  babe. Yeah. You're the lady that knows about the brain. I am. And we're happy to hear about [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=197.44s)]
*  it today. And we're happy to have you. Um, do I know the right position? No, I don't. Uh, I sleep. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=203.2s)]
*  Yeah. Tell me how you sleep. Oh, I sleep on my side, I guess. And pillow between my legs, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=210.16s)]
*  holding a pillow and just kind of hoping for the best. Usually. What do you, what is the, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=216.72s)]
*  what do you suggest? So sleeping on your side is actually the best position. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=224.4s)]
*  So sleeping on your side is good. Yeah. Okay. So left or right. Probably when, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=232.0s)]
*  so I like to connect everything back to evolution. So when we slept in the cave, we co-slept, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=236.8s)]
*  so we huddled together for warmth. And we probably slept on our left side to protect our heart [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=242.0s)]
*  and have our dominant hand ready for an attack. Okay. But now it doesn't matter which side, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  but a side is better than back or front. And the reason is that we're cleaning out our brain very [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=254.16s)]
*  actively overnight. And if your neck is stretched like this, then it helps the waste products to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=259.52s)]
*  like get moved out through the lymphatic and lymphatic systems and you know, excreted from [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=265.2s)]
*  your body. Oh, nice. So yeah, so I'm doing okay. No wonder you've got such a sharp wit. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=270.08s)]
*  Maybe, you know, it used to be better. I used to, I had so much stress over the past few years that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  a lot of my wit has started, has kind of, is eroded to be honest with you. I feel like it, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=281.92s)]
*  you know, I feel, I just know it. I used, my brain used to have more fun and now it feels like it has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=287.2s)]
*  more responsibility. And so it doesn't have the ability to have as much fun, I guess. And some of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  that could be growing up. Some of that could be actually having more responsibility, but I think [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=298.16s)]
*  there's just a lot of stress in the world, it feels like, especially here in the States. I feel [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=301.68s)]
*  like everybody's stressed out. Do you notice, is that something that you're noticing in you guys's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  field or is that even something that you guys look at? So I changed career actually around the time [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=311.68s)]
*  of the global financial crisis. And I went from being a psychiatrist in the national health service [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  in the UK to becoming a stress expert and advisor for very senior leadership people in financial [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=322.0s)]
*  services. At that time, we were seeing a lot of high profile suicides and heart attacks that were [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=330.08s)]
*  caused by stress, even if you weren't overweight or, you know, had high blood pressure or smoked [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=337.68s)]
*  or something like that. So that was a time where a former psychiatrist kind of could really find a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=342.56s)]
*  niche in a new career to help, you know, highly stressed people. Then things seemed to sort of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=350.88s)]
*  calm down a bit, but I think the new normal was just that we're kind of chronically stressed all [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=357.68s)]
*  the time. And then the pandemic happened. So unprecedented levels of stress, health, anxiety, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=362.24s)]
*  actual illness, and, you know, potentially people dealing with death. So just took things to the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=371.12s)]
*  next level and meant that all of us were more stressed than we should be all the time. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=377.04s)]
*  And the brain is constantly monitoring out like our stress levels. There's a hormone called [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=382.56s)]
*  cortisol. When that's high all the time, the body literally goes into survival mode. And I just feel [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=386.48s)]
*  like that's how so many of us, if not all of us are at the moment. Yeah, it feels like that. It [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  feels like everybody's in survival mode. It feels like, why are we like this right now? What's going [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=398.32s)]
*  on? Is it really happening that people are more stressed or is there just so much more awareness [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=403.12s)]
*  around it that we're also taking it on as like a placebo type of thing? I really don't agree with [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=408.0s)]
*  the latter because remember, I've been a psychiatrist for seven years before I even started [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=413.68s)]
*  coaching in this field. So, you know, there were reasons for people to be stressed and us to know [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=417.68s)]
*  about it for a long time. I think what's really changed at the start of the pandemic, I actually [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=423.76s)]
*  predicted this was going to be a mental health crisis. I also said it could be an opportunity [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=430.08s)]
*  for some kind of spiritual revolution. And I think that's happening for some people, people who are [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  deep into that are really kind of getting a lot out of it. But for most people, the pandemic [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=441.36s)]
*  happened, we came out of it and we thought, okay, everything will just go back to normal. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=446.48s)]
*  But actually, everyone's social circle shrank. We're more lost, lonely and disconnected than I [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=450.48s)]
*  think ever before in the history of humanity. I think the genders have become very polarised [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=456.8s)]
*  in a way that's not good for either gender. And I think that people are really struggling with what [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=462.24s)]
*  to do about that and often doing exactly the opposite of what they should be doing. So using [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=467.84s)]
*  your devices more when actually you should be connecting with people face to face more, for [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=473.2s)]
*  example. Kind of also because of devices and you know, let's say dating apps, for example, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  just using people as pieces of garbage that you can get through really quickly instead of forming [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=484.96s)]
*  actual deep meaningful relationships that could nurture both parties. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, it makes sense. I mean, say if you're looking on Amazon and you see different items, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=494.72s)]
*  you're like, I don't want this one, not this one, maybe this one, let me read up on it. Nah, yes. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  And then you are looking on the same thing and it's people, it would make sense that you start to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  treat them the same way in a way without even realizing it maybe, you know, especially because [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=510.16s)]
*  of that, you know, some of that phone access. What effects do we see when we're really stressed out [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=515.12s)]
*  that people may not notice? I had an experience years ago where I was extremely stressed. Some [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=520.72s)]
*  people I couldn't even talk to, some of my close friends just because of the volume or the speed [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=525.84s)]
*  they communicated at. I just, I was like, it's too much. I just couldn't handle it. I was so burnt [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=531.12s)]
*  out and I thought though that I just wasn't working hard enough. That was my first thought. I was like, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=536.72s)]
*  I got to do better. I'm not doing well enough. And that just burnt me even more. What's the best way [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=541.6s)]
*  to recognize when you're somebody that's at the brink kind of before you get there, I guess? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=548.88s)]
*  I always said that one of the most cruel aspects of any kind of mental health issue is that the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=554.56s)]
*  first symptom is loss of insight. So that means that the first thing that happens to you, you [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=559.76s)]
*  actually lose the clarity that something is going wrong. So being aware is really important. And [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=566.16s)]
*  sometimes this will come from your friends and family saying, Theo, what's going on? Like you're [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=572.48s)]
*  working like a maniac and you don't really seem well. Or it could come from if you've had previous [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=576.64s)]
*  experiences. So maybe if you ever got into that place again now, you might recognize it quicker [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=582.24s)]
*  because you've been through it before. And something like journaling can really help with [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  that as well for you to kind of have a tangible thing that you can read saying, I'm not sleeping [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  well. And that's usually a sign that I'm getting burnt out or, you know, I've withdrawn from my [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=596.16s)]
*  social circle. So yeah, some kind of reflection of yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Once you know what that is, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=600.56s)]
*  I used to have in my journal, a list of things to do when I'm stressed, because I would find that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=605.68s)]
*  when I get to the point of realizing that I'm stressed, I don't really have the higher mental [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  functions of working my way out of it. But now I don't need to look at that list. I kind of, and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  it's very simple things, talk to a friend, have a square of dark chocolate, take a nap, go for a walk, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=620.16s)]
*  you know, nothing kind of too extreme. So once you've started doing those things a little bit, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=626.0s)]
*  then it's obviously also important to address the cause of your stress. So if for you, it was [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=632.8s)]
*  working excessive hours, then trying to do whatever you can to, you know, minimize that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=639.92s)]
*  in the near future, or if you possibly could like take a quick digital detox break over a long [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=644.4s)]
*  weekend or something, you might feel a lot better. Yeah. One of the things I learned is that if I [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  just take two days of kind of, you know, drinking lemon water in the morning and just kind of, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=654.24s)]
*  you know, slowing down and eating really clean, that it can make a big difference in just two days. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  If you say, you know, I can't take proper time off for two months, but I can do this two days, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=666.72s)]
*  you might be able to reset yourself. And I try to share a lot of information about resetting your [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=671.2s)]
*  nervous system. So there are two modes we can be in, um, fright, flight, fight, or rest. Is that [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=675.9200000000001s)]
*  three modes or no? Fright, flight, fight. That's one of them. That's one of them. Okay, that's one [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  mode has three parts. Yeah. It's like, you know, you get a shock, you want to run away, or you have [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=689.44s)]
*  to attack a predator kind of thing. And the other mode is rest and digest. And that's the nice [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  feeling you get after you've had a nice meal and you just feel a bit lazy and really calm. And so [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=699.44s)]
*  we want to be in, in the rest and digest mode more of the time, but we tend to find that we're [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=704.4000000000001s)]
*  hypervigilant, like looking out for the next threat. Um, and actually if you were willing to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=708.96s)]
*  share, I have some research to share about the way that you grew up in that kind of environment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of breathing exercises that you can do to move yourself into the restful state. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=719.6s)]
*  For me, things like going for a long walk in nature really helps me to, to get into that state. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=724.24s)]
*  So people have to identify what it is that for you can reset your nervous system really quickly. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  But it's up to you. It's up to us, right? It's like, I think sometimes we're all looking for [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=735.84s)]
*  something to fix us or a certain medicine or a certain tea or a certain, you know, we're looking [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=739.5200000000001s)]
*  for something to get the job done for us, but in the end you really have to take, uh, control of it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=744.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you mentioned medication and I didn't even respond to that because to me, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  that's the absolute last resort. Um, but I think culturally the UK and the U S are a little bit, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=754.6400000000001s)]
*  you know, different on that. We're pretty piled up over here. We're like our pills, you know? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=759.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And I did, um, it did actually bring you a little tea. That's a kind of like [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=762.88s)]
*  calming nurturing one. So, you know, there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=767.84s)]
*  Brought me this nice gift. Very sweet. I saw this store. I was walking in London and I saw it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=771.12s)]
*  It's called Fortnum and Mason. It was real fancy in there. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=776.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. They got some nice tea right here. Rhapsody botanical infusion. This looks nice. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=780.64s)]
*  Maybe this little canister. Oh, it's a girl. Um, yeah, it looks nice. This is very sweet of you. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. You're welcome. I'm going to remember to calm down and have me some of this. Is this [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=792.96s)]
*  for calming down? Good. I need it. It's hard. Yeah. It's hard to calm down. It's hard to calm [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=796.88s)]
*  down when you feel like, well, there's all this feeling these days, like you're, you have to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=803.2s)]
*  fend for yourself. I think that's a big feeling of a lot of stress right now is like everybody [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=807.2s)]
*  kind of feels that, um, in America, some of the fabric of our society has started to kind of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=812.72s)]
*  disappear. It's like a lot of things that we felt like, um, people used to feel a sense of purpose [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=819.28s)]
*  from our country and we're not feeling that now. And so immediately that kind of like gets very [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=825.2s)]
*  scary, you know, uh, cause then you're like, well, what do I belong to? And the closest thing you [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  find is yourself or your family. And so those are the things you really start to lock in on. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=834.88s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I, there's two things I want to say here. Let's, I'll start with myself and then come [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=839.5200000000001s)]
*  to you. I have worked very hard to create a large community of people around me that I really trust [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=845.12s)]
*  that make me, that make me feel safe. Although, you know, I agree that safety and peace and [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=853.36s)]
*  freedom have to come from yourself, but you also create the narrative that you have about the world, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=857.6s)]
*  um, through your experiences and your perception of the world ever since you were a child, but [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=863.76s)]
*  there's a choice as an adult that you can make to change some of that. So I put things into place [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=869.92s)]
*  that I can see every day in my life that make me feel like the world is a safe place where I can [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=877.12s)]
*  take some risks and I can trust and that could make my life better, but I can completely understand [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=882.24s)]
*  why if you haven't worked on that for decades, um, and maybe you don't know about things like [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=887.84s)]
*  neuroplasticity, which we can come onto, you know, how you can change the pathways in your brain, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=892.96s)]
*  that it's very easy to default to the world is not a safe place. Um, you know, I'm not safe. I, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=897.76s)]
*  I can't trust anyone. I have to be careful. And this particularly came up for me when I was, um, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=903.6s)]
*  looking into some research and you shared with me that, um, well, I won't put words into your mouth. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=909.36s)]
*  I asked you to identify the first age at which you experienced some kind of neglect or abuse or [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  trauma in childhood. Would you like to share what you said? Yeah, for sure. I, um, I talk about this [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  sometimes on here and I don't want to beat a dead horse, but this is an environment where it's, it's [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=928.4s)]
*  like helpful to share about that kind of stuff. Um, yeah, my mother had like a condition, I think, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=932.48s)]
*  where she couldn't, um, she had like this kind of almost, I say like it's an emotional autism in a [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=938.16s)]
*  way, but she didn't know if there was something wrong with you. Yeah. My mother didn't really [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=943.76s)]
*  build like a connection with me when I was young. She didn't really look at me. She didn't touch me [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=948.3199999999999s)]
*  very much and she couldn't tell if there was something wrong with me. So if I was sitting [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=951.92s)]
*  somewhere crying, she didn't, she didn't understand there was something wrong, right? Or if I looked [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=956.7199999999999s)]
*  scared, she didn't understand there was something wrong. Now, if I had a cut on my arm, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  she immediately could be like, Oh, how can I, what's going on here? Cause it was very odd. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=968.0s)]
*  I don't know if it was obvious or it was tangible. It's tangible. Yeah. But anything that was [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=973.2s)]
*  intangible, like emotional, there was just no, there was nothing there, you know? And so I think, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=977.52s)]
*  yeah, when I grew up, it was just like that a lot. And so I was constantly in a fright or flight, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=984.48s)]
*  probably. Yeah. And I know that you, you want to like heal and move on and not flog a dead horse, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=989.84s)]
*  but I really feel like I can bring some new information to you that could really help you. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=996.32s)]
*  No, it's good. So there's a psychological sort of construct called psychosocial stages of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  childhood development. Now, Freud first described this and basically said, you know, whether it's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1008.64s)]
*  from zero to two or two to five or five to seven, whenever you feel like the first, you know, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1014.24s)]
*  separation from your parents or illness or something happened, there's a rewiring of that [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1019.2s)]
*  child's brain. And Freud said the outcome is always bad. So something goes wrong. You know, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1025.04s)]
*  you suffered neglect or trauma. This is what's going to be wrong with you. But Erickson came [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1030.48s)]
*  along later and said that it could be a vice or a virtue. So something could go wrong. And obviously, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1035.2s)]
*  a lot of people end up, you know, in with substance abuse or criminality and things like that. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1039.92s)]
*  But if you're lucky, if you have, you know, one supportive adult in your life, or you as a child [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  make some kind of amazing intuitive choice, then you can go down the other path. Now for you, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1051.28s)]
*  having experienced this from zero to 18 months, which is the first stage, and then on, it's the [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1056.8000000000002s)]
*  vice and virtue are mistrust and trust. So if you go down the road of mistrust, it's having [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1064.4s)]
*  feeling unsafe in your environment and having fear of future events. But it's also possible [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1072.0800000000002s)]
*  that you could have gone down the road of feeling safe in your environment and hopeful for future [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1078.24s)]
*  events. And the piece I really loved, which is connected to the gift. So after you shared [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  that with me before I flew, I never ever take a gift to someone if I'm going to do a podcast. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1088.72s)]
*  And I also think it's a little maybe a slightly strange thing to do. But I just had this [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1094.64s)]
*  feeling in my heart, like, I really want to get him a gift. And obviously, that shop is like very [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1099.04s)]
*  English. So that made sense. But I walked around the entire store and I looked at every tea. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1103.92s)]
*  And it has like teas and jams and cookies and stuff. And I finally found that one and picked it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1108.72s)]
*  And then I did further research into Ericsson. And he basically said that the way for you to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1114.4s)]
*  heal is through nourishment and affection. And that was exactly why I chose the gift I chose for you. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1120.3200000000002s)]
*  So obviously, my like neuroscience experience kind of brought me to an intuitive answer. But [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  it's also said that if you do the right work, and you're still in the window of opportunity, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1132.8000000000002s)]
*  it's sort of in your 40s, you know, midlife is actually a big opportunity to rewire your [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1138.24s)]
*  brain in a really healthy way, then what the outcome that you could have would be a really [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1143.12s)]
*  positive experience of interdependence and relatedness. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1149.36s)]
*  Well, thank you. It's very sweet of you. And it's nice to have and we'll make sure to keep it in [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  here so we can remember that too. And our and our listeners and viewers can look at it and [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1157.84s)]
*  remember that too that, yeah, that there's a way to move forward, right? That's the biggest thing. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1162.08s)]
*  Because you had a certain point you kind of get tired. There's part of you that gets tired of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1168.3999999999999s)]
*  using the past as a crutch kind of there's a part of you that still is in some pain from it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  And then there's a part of you that slowly comes along that, you know, that really wants to move [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  forward, you know, and that part starts to grow. I've noticed that part grow in me more, especially [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1186.96s)]
*  in the past year. So I'm grateful for that. I never really thought that that that would kind [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  of happen. But is there a way that people can choose the perspective that they want if they [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1195.28s)]
*  want to choose mistrust or trust now that they're an adult? You know? Yeah. So interestingly, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1200.08s)]
*  Carl Jung, another psychologist, also said that 42 to 44 is the sort of corridor of age where we [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1207.28s)]
*  go from not being our best selves to the ability to choose. And I think you're in that. Yeah, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1215.12s)]
*  I'm in there. Yeah. And you said in the last year it happened. So unless people have some kind of [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1221.04s)]
*  crisis, like a divorce at the age of 35 or something, then people don't usually come to [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1225.6s)]
*  this point of like, do I choose trust or mistrust? Until naturally until about 42 to 44. And so first [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1232.08s)]
*  of all, obviously, you have to know that that there are these options. So if people Google [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1240.1599999999999s)]
*  Ericson's stages of psychosocial development. Yeah. So basically trust versus mistrust is the [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1246.0s)]
*  first one that was you. A lot of my CEO clients are in the industry versus inferiority one, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1250.9599999999998s)]
*  which is age five to seven usually. And is that like the you always hear a lot about, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1258.56s)]
*  you don't think you're good enough or whatever? Yeah. Imposter syndrome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1264.9599999999998s)]
*  always hear about that imposter syndrome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is pornography causing a problem [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1269.28s)]
*  in your life? That's a good question. It's a real question. It has in mind. It has at certain [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1273.76s)]
*  periods in my life, uh, watching porno and everything and watching porno was making me, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1280.56s)]
*  it was ruining my life. It was ruining my life, man. Made me feel just so much shame. That's what [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1287.28s)]
*  it did. Well, I'm watching pornography has become commonplace today. And oftentimes men will use [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1292.24s)]
*  porn. Oh, to numb the pain of loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and depression. That's all I want to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1299.36s)]
*  introduce you to my friend, Steven Walt. Steve is the founder of valor recovery. He is a dear [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1306.6399999999999s)]
*  friend of mine. He is a dear friend of mine. And valor recovery is a program to help men overcome [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1313.04s)]
*  porn abuse and sexual compulsivity. That's right. Their coaches are in long-term recovery and they [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1320.1599999999999s)]
*  will be your partner, mentor, and spiritual guide to transcend problematic behaviors. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1327.36s)]
*  There is zero commitment. If you reach out to them, it's just the first step in trying to figure out [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1333.04s)]
*  if you may need some help, if you can get some help to learn more about valor recovery, please [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1339.52s)]
*  visit them at valor recovery coaching.com or email them at admin at valor recovery coaching.com. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1345.4399999999998s)]
*  The links will be on the YouTube. And again, there's no commitment when you reach out to them. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1356.96s)]
*  But I promise you, only something positive will come from you reaching out and figuring out [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1364.24s)]
*  if what type of help, if any, could benefit you. Thank you. How do we adjust our perspective? Is [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1370.96s)]
*  it that possible that we can adjust our perspective now? Yeah. So there's this amazing thing called [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1379.68s)]
*  neuroplasticity. When I was still at medical school, we didn't have sophisticated scanning [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1385.36s)]
*  techniques for brains or bodies. So we had kind of like x-rays and- Oh yeah, and just asking people [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1390.9599999999998s)]
*  guessing? Yeah, kind of. And neurology, a lot of guessing, because if someone had a brain tumor, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  but you knew where it was roughly, then you would say, oh, now we know which part of the brain you [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1403.4399999999998s)]
*  use for writing. Or it was a lot of guesswork in neurology particularly. Once we could scan brains, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1407.84s)]
*  we could see how healthy brains are working. So what's happening when you're experiencing an [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1414.4s)]
*  emotion or you're recalling a memory or you're making a decision or being really funny. We can [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1420.4s)]
*  see what's going on in the brain, which parts of the brain are interacting with each other, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1427.68s)]
*  which systems are getting a lot of blood flow. And so we also then found out that, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1431.68s)]
*  because we used to think that by the time you stopped physically growing, like age 18, that [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1437.3600000000001s)]
*  your brain became completely fixed, your personality, your IQ, et cetera. We now know [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1441.44s)]
*  that the brain actively grows and changes till we're about 25. So if you think of a newborn baby, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1446.3200000000002s)]
*  it can't do anything. And within 18 months- It's ridiculous really. If you look at it, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1452.24s)]
*  you're like, this is ridiculous. You would never draft one on your fantasy team or whatever. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1459.52s)]
*  They just, it's bad. But anyway, go on. I mean, I like what God does, but some of that is, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1464.96s)]
*  the starting point is very far. You're far off the line, it feels like. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1469.9199999999998s)]
*  But isn't it incredible what happens within 18 months? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1477.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1480.56s)]
*  So then they're like walking, they can control their own bladder and bowels. They can speak up [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1481.12s)]
*  to five languages if they've been exposed to different languages in the first few years of [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1486.4799999999998s)]
*  their life. So that's the biggest example of neuroplasticity. That change is incredible, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1490.56s)]
*  as you've just said. And then in teenage, there's quite a lot of change. The brain becomes a bit [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1497.12s)]
*  more sophisticated for adulthood. And then this process is going on really actively till we're [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1500.9599999999998s)]
*  about 25. And then from 25 to sort of 70-ish, you have to put in more effort to get your brain to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1506.0s)]
*  change, to get your brain to keep learning and growing. But it's absolutely possible. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1514.7199999999998s)]
*  And for some people, it's okay to plateau. If you get a job that you love and you want to do that [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1521.28s)]
*  for the rest of your life and you married your high school sweetheart and nothing really needs [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1526.24s)]
*  to change, that's fine too. But for a lot of us, this opportunity to think that you can really [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1530.0s)]
*  change your personality, your career, your community, your resilience throughout your life [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1536.88s)]
*  is like a beacon of hope. So. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1542.88s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. Yeah, because you start to think, oh, it's too late. But you're saying it's not. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1550.72s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1551.28s)]
*  So once you know about, and also I'm doing that thing about saying so the whole time, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1552.32s)]
*  which I want to start doing. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1557.12s)]
*  Do people say it a lot? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1558.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1559.76s)]
*  Who does? Americans? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1560.48s)]
*  I was, well, an American producer told me that everybody does it. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1562.56s)]
*  Says so? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1566.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1566.8s)]
*  I don't know if we, we might, I don't know. I don't know that much, but. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1567.76s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1571.52s)]
*  I, yeah, I'm hopeful that you know what you're talking about because I don't, you know? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1571.9199999999998s)]
*  If you know about neuroplasticity, that, that means you know that you have some options to change [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1577.1200000000001s)]
*  the way that you behave in the outside world or your thought patterns and your beliefs about [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1583.2s)]
*  yourself. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1587.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. So you're saying there's still a lot of hope. There's still a lot of hope for people [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1588.0800000000002s)]
*  from 20 to 75. There's still a, it's, yeah, it shouldn't be something, anything you feel [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1591.28s)]
*  hopeless about your brain, you can still, and that's the main thing you got to change. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And you might be able to identify what that is for yourself, but I think this [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1600.4s)]
*  Ericsson stages is a really helpful one because people can go and look up the age that they were [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  when they first felt abandoned or neglected and then work out what their particular issue is and [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1608.48s)]
*  work on that. But if I was doing a proper session with you, you know, like I do with, with people, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1613.36s)]
*  I would ask you, what is the repeated negative thought that you have about yourself? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1619.12s)]
*  I don't know if it's a thought, but it feels like a belief and it just feels like I have to do [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1627.36s)]
*  something to be worth something. That's the biggest one. I think that was always there. Like [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1632.72s)]
*  whatever I do is in, you know, this isn't good enough. You're not enough. Yeah. You know, that [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1641.84s)]
*  was like a deep one. And it's, it's not even something I think it's just something that it's [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1647.84s)]
*  almost like a magnet that's inside of me, you know, and it, it brings my other thoughts down to it a [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1651.68s)]
*  lot of times. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1657.04s)]
*  So you've kind of said the thought and the belief, which, which often what I have to do with [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1657.76s)]
*  people is dig under the thought to actually find out what the belief is that's driving that thought. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1663.52s)]
*  And then I help people to create an affirmation. That's the opposite of that belief. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1668.24s)]
*  Yeah. Cause sometimes it's like the thought will be, man, this isn't good enough. And it goes back [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1672.8s)]
*  to the belief that, you know, I would always set my goals ridiculous. So always I felt like I was [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1679.12s)]
*  underachieving always. Cause I had, I didn't know what my goals were, but I just knew that [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1686.88s)]
*  I needed to get my mother's attention. I needed to get some feeling. I needed to get some response. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1691.7600000000002s)]
*  Right. And I would try everything. And so, and nothing worked. And so I think it may, it created [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1696.48s)]
*  this thing inside of me where you always have to keep trying. So there's never a piece you have to [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1702.8000000000002s)]
*  keep trying and it's always never going to work. Yeah. Everything you do will never be enough. Yes. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1710.16s)]
*  Just to even get that minimal piece of attention from your primary caregiver. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1715.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Everything I do will never be enough. And so it started is it then that kind of went [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1719.44s)]
*  through my life, I guess, you know? So have you heard of a part of the brain called the amygdala? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1724.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So this is where all our basic emotions come from. Like caveman stuff, huh? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1728.32s)]
*  And there's that movie, I think it's called Free Solo about the guy who climbs like a crazy [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1735.44s)]
*  vertical cliff face in Yosemite. Oh yeah. That guy's really interesting. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1740.4s)]
*  Have you seen his brain scan? No. Okay. So they found out that basically he doesn't really have [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1745.3600000000001s)]
*  an amygdala or any activity in his amygdala. So he can't feel fear. And that's why he'll do things [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1751.52s)]
*  that you and I would be like, I'm not going to do that because I'm going to die if I do that. Yeah. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1757.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So my buddy Jeff was like that. He would always, yeah, he would just burn a lot of shit [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1760.8000000000002s)]
*  in his house and stuff. And like, and he, he was just, he was an idiot, but, um, oh wow. This is [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1767.2s)]
*  that guy's brain scan. This is so cool that you do this by the way. Yeah. It's neat to be able to see [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1773.8400000000001s)]
*  things, you know? Wow. So he doesn't have a fear. So some people have less fear than other people. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1778.56s)]
*  So fear is actually our most basic emotion. And in this movie, in this documentary, they showed [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1783.44s)]
*  the reason he could do these crazy things was because he wasn't experiencing fear. But in [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1789.04s)]
*  similar research, we see that female primates who have damage, physical damage to their amygdala [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1793.84s)]
*  will neglect or even physically abuse their babies. So what's becoming interesting now is that this [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1801.28s)]
*  psychological stuff, like you say, I think my mom had some form of emotional autism. It's becoming [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1808.24s)]
*  much more aligned to physiological stuff. So kind of now we say anything biological probably has a [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1813.9199999999998s)]
*  psychological element and anything psychological, you know, maybe underpinned by some kind of [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1818.72s)]
*  neurological issue. So, you know, it's perhaps too late to investigate that, but it just makes [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1824.24s)]
*  the point that there are so many reasons she could have been like that. And none of them are actually [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1831.2s)]
*  to do with you. Right. Um, yeah, because as a youth, you think it's your, yeah, when you're, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1834.56s)]
*  of course, when you're a baby or a kid, you, everything in the world revolves around you. So [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1840.16s)]
*  if the world isn't giving you any, a lot of stuff back, then you think it's your fault, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1844.1599999999999s)]
*  you know? And so that's where you create ideas like, oh, I'm not enough. Nothing I ever do [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1849.1999999999998s)]
*  will be enough, you know? Um, and how do you think this has played out in your relationships [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1853.12s)]
*  with women throughout your life? It's been tough, I think, you know, it's been tough. I remember I [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1859.6799999999998s)]
*  would be like, I didn't know how long to look at a girl when you, when you looked at them, you know, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1864.56s)]
*  I didn't, I would get super nervous. I remember like in my twenties, if there was like intimacy [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1870.0800000000002s)]
*  or something, you know, I got super, it made me super nervous. I always felt nervous. Um, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1876.24s)]
*  it gave me like, yeah, sexual problems, cause just the mist, like I think just not [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1882.88s)]
*  knowing how to be around somebody, uh, those types of things for sure. Um, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1890.64s)]
*  and then I think fear, like I put woman on a pedestal a lot of times, you know, it was like if [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1897.84s)]
*  they were always kind of unattainable in a way inside of me, you know, it's like, oh, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1906.48s)]
*  I'm not going to get a girl that I want. I'm just going to get a girl that, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1913.12s)]
*  you know, I hope the best that a girl will want me, right? So that was kind of maybe some of my, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  some thought patterns. Those aren't all the things that I have today. You know, some of that is [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1925.6000000000001s)]
*  certainly eroded and I've learned a lot over the years and stuff. Um, but those are some of the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1929.92s)]
*  things I think if that's what you're asking about. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it makes sense because [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1935.2s)]
*  it's basically a mirror of, you know, no matter what I did, I couldn't get my mom's attention. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1941.5200000000002s)]
*  So women must be so far away. I won't be able to get their attention. Yeah. And then if one did, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1947.2s)]
*  I would like kind of, I would be overbearing kind of sometimes, you know, I just, you learn all that [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1951.2s)]
*  kind of stuff the hard way. Then you're like, you know, if a girl looks at you one time or even like, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1955.68s)]
*  you know, even if she's just taking her garbage out or whatever, and you're hiding in the bushes [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1961.52s)]
*  or whatever, but even if she looks over, you're like, damn, this might be something real, you know, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1965.52s)]
*  I would fantasize like before I'd even, I would adjust kind of my plans. Like I'm going to go out [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  of town, but then I'd seen this girl's like, maybe I'll stay in town a few extra days. Maybe [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1975.76s)]
*  I'll see this girl again. Just like very, you know, kind of, I kind of based a lot of my life [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1978.88s)]
*  around the hope that I, that there would be some connection, you know? So that kind of stuff, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1987.5200000000002s)]
*  I think wasn't very healthy. And then when I did get a connection with a woman, I couldn't, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1993.3600000000001s)]
*  if I couldn't do, it was too much. It was very hard to, to lock in on a relationship. I'd always [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=1999.92s)]
*  find myself cheating that sort of thing, you know? Have you heard about this hormone called [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2006.64s)]
*  oxytocin? Yeah. Yeah. So actually the way that we build the emotional architecture in our brains [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2010.48s)]
*  is through eye contact with our mom. So you didn't have that. You also didn't get physical affection, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2018.64s)]
*  which, you know, your mother holding you or kind of, you know, cuddling you would induce oxytocin [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2023.3600000000001s)]
*  and that would help to build healthy neural architecture in your emotional system. So you [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2029.3600000000001s)]
*  didn't, you didn't have that. So no, the arc, the architecture was very limited. It was luckily, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2034.4s)]
*  it was a damn, you know, it was more of a hardies. I felt like that somebody had built her a Tim [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2040.4s)]
*  Hortons inside of me. It was very, yeah, it was just a, you know, it was just like more of a kebab [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2044.88s)]
*  shack, you know, than it was like a real fixture of love. It felt like, you know, I was going to [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2050.88s)]
*  say, I don't know what Tim Hortons is, so I couldn't drive through establishment. You know, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2055.44s)]
*  it wasn't a real place of like, you know, there wasn't a ton of value like in the architecture, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2061.52s)]
*  I don't think. And in your life now, whether it's through friends, family, pets, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2067.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, sometimes even things like bathing or getting a massage, how much physical affection [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2076.16s)]
*  do you get? Well, it's weird because I kind of created a life that's kind of isolating sometimes [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2080.0s)]
*  because I think that's maybe what I was used to. And then, but now it's gotten better. I go do get [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2086.88s)]
*  more massages. I find myself, I am able to lock in a little bit more communication with women. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel more confident. You know, I've been like done therapy for a long time. I did some ayahuasca [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2100.32s)]
*  seminars, things like that. So plant medicine. So there's been things that I think have helped me, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2106.32s)]
*  you know? Okay. So for people who are lonely, because I think this is a, you know, an issue [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2110.6400000000003s)]
*  as well at the moment, bathing instead of showering actually gives you oxytocin because [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2114.96s)]
*  you're enveloped in warmth. It's kind of like a hug. So that's one thing that people can do. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2119.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. When you get out of a warm bath, you're just like, oh man, you know? Yeah. Yeah. You almost [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2125.36s)]
*  feel like a baby kind of. Do you think this is the reason that you sleep with the air conditioning [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2130.0s)]
*  on so high and so that you're wrapped up in lots of blankets? It could be. Oh, I noticed if I don't [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2136.32s)]
*  tuck the blanket under my feet, then it's very hard for me to sleep. So I'm still, yeah, I'm [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2141.2s)]
*  definitely a very tall baby. I think, you know? Yeah, I think so. So that's okay. I have to [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2146.96s)]
*  remember that sometimes, you know? Yeah. I mean, I'm in like recovery programs and they're always [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2153.3599999999997s)]
*  like, we're all babies. We're just retarded or not. Or I don't know if people say like, but we're [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2159.04s)]
*  like not doing, we're just babies that are having a tough time, you know? Like if you saw a baby [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2163.7599999999998s)]
*  smoking or drinking a coffee, you'd be like, God, this baby. It's in a bad way. He isn't doing well. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2168.16s)]
*  Yeah. The baby was taking like a Propecia or something like, God, this baby needs some help. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2173.04s)]
*  Needs some help. So yeah, I'm one of those babies, but I'm getting better. I feel like I'm a kind of [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2179.04s)]
*  a, I'm like, now I'm like a camp counselor of the babies, you know? I'm not as much, you know? I'm [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2182.8799999999997s)]
*  still kind of a baby, but I'm, I'm evolving out of it pretty quick. I hope. So another tip for you, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2188.08s)]
*  I'm pleased to hear that you're having massages and therapy, but I find that there's a place that [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2193.36s)]
*  talking therapy can't go beyond. And that is trauma that is stored in the body that you're not [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2199.2000000000003s)]
*  even consciously aware of. Have you heard of that book, The Body Keeps the Score? Yeah. So it was [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2205.36s)]
*  written in the seventies, but it's back in the bestseller list, which is making me feel hopeful [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2210.1600000000003s)]
*  that more people are realizing that since the pandemic that we've got trauma stored in our [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2214.56s)]
*  bodies. So I've actually recently been doing some somatic therapy called body realignment, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2219.36s)]
*  and it seemed to be for me surfacing emotions that I perhaps don't allow myself to in talking [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2225.92s)]
*  therapy or in regular life. I think there are some emotions, for example, anger, that it's [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  quite still socially unacceptable for women to express. That's a good point. Yeah. Women [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2237.92s)]
*  aren't allowed to get super angry, I guess. When I did boxing, I actually like felt like [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2243.04s)]
*  I released a lot of anger as well. I can only do that physically, whether it's through a sport or [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2248.88s)]
*  this kind of body thing. And I think for men, it might be things more like sadness that it's [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2254.48s)]
*  not socially acceptable to express as much. Yeah, probably. So I think a little bit, even [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2259.92s)]
*  though it's more now, I think people are kind of now everything's a little bit more free. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2265.04s)]
*  What type of trauma get really can get held in our bodies? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2271.36s)]
*  Oh, all sorts. So that phrase psychosomatic is that all the various emotions that we can feel [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2274.48s)]
*  can end up showing up as physical symptoms in our body. And that can be actual illness, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2282.56s)]
*  but also it can just be aches and pains. For me, it's like tense shoulders and just aches and pains. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2289.2799999999997s)]
*  But when I actually had the body realignment therapy, there were parts of my body that I [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2295.52s)]
*  wouldn't even think like kind of like the size of my ribs and things that was so painful. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2299.44s)]
*  And the therapists, they know which parts of your body can, you know, certain emotions get stored in. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2304.8799999999997s)]
*  So I think for that one, you really have to find someone that can guide you through that. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2309.8399999999997s)]
*  But the point I, another point that I really wanted to make is we talk a lot about trauma. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2314.64s)]
*  And like, you know, like you set such a great example to people of don't just keep focusing [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2319.68s)]
*  on the trauma and be a victim. I actually think we have as much access to generational healing [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2324.7999999999997s)]
*  as we do to generational trauma. So, you know, horrific things have happened in the past, like [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2332.48s)]
*  the Holocaust, apartheid, slavery, the treatment of the first Americans. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2337.92s)]
*  Yeah. France winning the world cup as well. Some people would say that was pretty. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2344.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, it affects people for generations into the future. Yeah, totally. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2350.16s)]
*  Some people it will, but what were you going to say? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2356.96s)]
*  So I was going to say that we can also get access to ancestral or ancient wisdom. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2359.12s)]
*  And if, if we put that together with the somatic stuff, think about what our ancestors did when [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2364.88s)]
*  they didn't really have resources spare to have fun, right? But they danced, they drummed, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2370.24s)]
*  they chanted, they hummed, they sang, they painted. These physical activities are actually really good [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2375.44s)]
*  for us and can help us to release some of that stored trauma. So I'd love people to go away with [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2382.0s)]
*  that message that yes, you might have stored trauma that talking therapy hasn't completely [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2387.2s)]
*  got rid of, but there are things that you can do at home. You don't have to pay for a massage. You [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2391.7599999999998s)]
*  can, you can do self massage. You can take a bath. You can dance around your living room. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2396.3199999999997s)]
*  And all of these things could also help you to release that kind of trauma. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2401.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I've noticed how there'll be times where I've done yoga and a certain thing, and [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2405.3599999999997s)]
*  then I'll lay down after it and tears will come out of my face and it's just pain, something being [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2408.96s)]
*  released. Sometimes a memory or something might be with it or a feeling, but it's, it's, yeah, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2414.08s)]
*  it's pretty amazing that that kind of thing can happen. In yoga, hip opening particularly releases [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2418.88s)]
*  a lot of emotions. So again, people can Google some, some of the like hip opening poses and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2423.2s)]
*  you're supposed to stay in them for longer, like five minutes. And if it produces tears, then it's [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2429.36s)]
*  definitely helping release trauma. Yeah. I feel like we've kind of been all over the place right [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2434.0s)]
*  now. I want to talk. So let's go through a couple of things. So I want to know like, does stress [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2438.3199999999997s)]
*  affect men and women the same? This is a really interesting one. So there are different forms [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2442.48s)]
*  of stress. One is called adaptive stress and it's actually a very healthy response to a short term [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2449.6s)]
*  stressor, like a deadline or a podcast interview or something. And then there's the chronic stress, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2455.12s)]
*  which is bad for us because it starts to erode our immunity. It causes a lot of inflammation [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2461.84s)]
*  throughout the body, but the differences between men and women aren't with regard to those. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2467.28s)]
*  It's with regard to how we respond to being in either of those situations. So men, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2472.32s)]
*  and all of this is based on population norm studies. So it's most men and most women, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2479.6000000000004s)]
*  but men are very good at reacting to a crisis and releasing all of that cortisol and adrenaline and [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2483.36s)]
*  fighting off the monster or whatever it is, but they have to rest afterwards. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2491.92s)]
*  Women can actually find ways to recoup resilience during long periods of stress. So they'll still [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2496.8s)]
*  deal with the stressful thing, but at times they'll find whether it's speaking with a girlfriend or [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2502.72s)]
*  taking a bath or going for a walk in nature, they find ways to keep their resources topped up so [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2510.08s)]
*  they don't have that crash that more men tend to have. I wonder sometimes if a lot of like, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2515.52s)]
*  because we have so many, everybody feels so stressed out and it seems like it's such a thing. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2522.64s)]
*  I wonder sometimes I think like it used to be we had to literally [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  like be weary of like a lying attack on us. It was like really fight or flight. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2530.48s)]
*  But now that's not the case, right? But I wonder if that thing that was worried about everything [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2536.7999999999997s)]
*  out here just started to go inside of us because there wasn't anything else out here to fight. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2543.52s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. The biggest threats to our safety now are psychological threats. So things [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2548.56s)]
*  like your partner leaving you, you losing your job, your friends not liking you anymore. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2554.24s)]
*  Yeah, the fear started to become internal as opposed to external. And I wonder if we're [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2559.52s)]
*  partially just in a phase of that, you know, like we're evolved, you know, it's almost like [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2564.0s)]
*  an evolution because yeah, the lions now are the fears inside of us. Like you're saying our partner [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2569.36s)]
*  leaving us or us losing our ability to feed our families or a goal that we have not working out [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2574.72s)]
*  or something, losing a job. Yeah. Yeah. The things that you need to kind of keep your basic life [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2582.24s)]
*  on the road that it's on, you know, not lose the things that make you feel psychologically safe. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2589.2799999999997s)]
*  Are you less stressful if you're in a relationship? Does relationships or [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2594.16s)]
*  like love having somebody, a family, does that affect stress at all? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2597.8399999999997s)]
*  It depends what kind of relationship, right? So yeah, yeah. If it's an interdependent trusting [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2601.7599999999998s)]
*  relationship where, you know, both parties are in it for the long term, then that inevitably will [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2608.64s)]
*  reduce your stress levels. But I mean, what I'm seeing a lot of at the moment actually is [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2616.3199999999997s)]
*  as women, we tend to be having the same conversations that, you know, whether you're [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2622.72s)]
*  in your 20s, 30s, 40s, whatever, of kind of, you know, want to find a nice man and settle down. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2626.56s)]
*  Um, but just feeling like that desire for commitment isn't the same as it was, you know, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2633.28s)]
*  basically since there have been apps and stuff like that. Um, but I've actually got some really [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2641.28s)]
*  close male friends and they've been confiding in me recently that a, they don't really talk to each [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2646.6400000000003s)]
*  other about deep things like they do with me and that some of them have no one to confide in. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2652.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2656.32s)]
*  Um, and you know, lovely guys who I think would make, you know, nice husbands for some of my [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2657.36s)]
*  friends, but have been so broken by toxic relationships that they've been in that they [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2663.44s)]
*  now just want non-committal casual relationships. And this is where the problem starts is where a [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2670.56s)]
*  guy says, let's say it was you and I, and you say, Tara, I've had all these issues. I've just told [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2676.6400000000003s)]
*  you about my upbringing, mommy issues, et cetera. I can't commit to you, but you know, we can hang [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2681.2s)]
*  out. But if I'm thinking, well, you know, I'd like to marry you. So I'm going to hang out with you [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2686.7999999999997s)]
*  in the hope that you'll get to know me and like me and change your mind. That happens so much. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  And then it leads to issues obviously for both parties when it doesn't work out. So that's an [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2698.8799999999997s)]
*  incredibly stressful place to be in no matter what gender you are. And the outcome only reinforces [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2704.3199999999997s)]
*  for both that you're not worthy of love. Yeah. How does it reinforce that? So for the, for the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2710.48s)]
*  woman, particularly if they're actually being intimate, she will be experiencing a lot of [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2719.36s)]
*  oxytocin. Basically that happens through cuddling and physical intimacy, but like off the scale [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2724.2400000000002s)]
*  when you orgasm. Okay. So she'll be getting more and more bonded to the guy. If the guy has, you [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2730.88s)]
*  know, has no intentions of this becoming a committed relationship, then he'll be experiencing a lot of [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2737.68s)]
*  reward like the dopamine, the reward chemical, lots of testosterone. And there's also this hormone [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2742.64s)]
*  called vasopressin, which in both genders is to do with our blood volume and our blood salt. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2749.44s)]
*  But for men, it's also to do with bonding, social bonding and aggression, but aggression in terms of [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2755.92s)]
*  protecting and being possessive of your partner. And so if men don't get to have sex straight away, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2761.76s)]
*  that hormone will build and build and build, and then they'll become bonded to the woman. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2769.28s)]
*  And then they'll also start releasing oxytocin when they orgasm. So there's better value in [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2773.1200000000003s)]
*  creating a relationship if you don't have sex immediately. It will work better for the woman [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2778.0800000000004s)]
*  in terms of chances of the man bonding with her. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I feel like it, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2784.0800000000004s)]
*  sometimes I've romanticized the past and it feels like that used to be more of the thing, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2788.24s)]
*  you know, like people would wait till marriage for sex. And so it creates, you know, that had a lot [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2792.08s)]
*  more value to it. Like, yeah, I think sex and animacies kind of like was, I don't know, for a [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2796.56s)]
*  lot of guys, it got replaced by pornography too. I think really damaged it, especially for me. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2805.68s)]
*  You know, once I found pornography, there was a way to have a feeling, a connection with a woman [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2812.0s)]
*  that was safe enough for me to be in. I knew it wasn't, I wasn't going to be hurt. There was some [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2818.72s)]
*  sexual reward to it and I could start it and stop it as I wish. And it was the only kind of relationship [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2825.44s)]
*  I could even really handle kind of when I was in other relationships, but those weren't none of [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2831.68s)]
*  them were as long as my relationship with pornography, you know, to be honest. Yeah. And [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2837.44s)]
*  right now I'm like, I think I'm 77 days off of pornography and 70 days off of masturbation. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2842.4799999999996s)]
*  So I've had sexual activities, but I haven't been, you know, touching my wiener or whatever, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2849.3599999999997s)]
*  people that say different stuff, you know what I'm saying? Like, I don't know what they say in [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2857.9199999999996s)]
*  your country, you know, topping off the- Wanking. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2861.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, okay. Wanking or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thinking of the queen or whatever [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2864.64s)]
*  they say, you know, I don't know what they say. Queen takes rook or whatever. That's like a chess [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2870.08s)]
*  move, but yeah. So that's been kind of different, you know, for me that's been different, but that [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2875.12s)]
*  was a huge thing. How is it different? Well, for one, I quit thinking about it. It's like, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2880.88s)]
*  I don't think about pornography. I don't think about like masturbation. I don't have that weird [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2886.64s)]
*  feeling where like I'll masturbate and then I'll just be laying there like I'm still right where I [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2890.16s)]
*  was, but I've like kind of ejaculated or whatever. Cause like sometimes like semen or some people [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2896.08s)]
*  call it what I don't know what people call it or whatever, like party sauce or whatever. I don't [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2905.92s)]
*  even know what people call it, you know, on the street or whatever, but like I feel like the more [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2909.7599999999998s)]
*  I keep it in my body, the more masculine I feel, right? And the more of myself I feel as opposed [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2913.68s)]
*  to just having a leak of it constantly, you know, it was kind of like almost had a leak [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2920.16s)]
*  of my masculinity and I would cause the leak, but the leak would happen. And it was just like a [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2923.84s)]
*  dripping pipe. It was like, you look at a dripping pipe, you're like, ah, you know, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2929.36s)]
*  but you look at a pipe that's not dripping. You're like, Hey, this is some pretty good [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2934.48s)]
*  construction. I love that phrase leak of my masculinity. So yeah, that's kind of what it [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2937.52s)]
*  felt like, you know, now that I really think about it. And then I start to look at women a little bit. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2941.44s)]
*  I don't think of it just so much in, I've always thought of women in more than just a sexual sense, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2946.4s)]
*  but the sexual part isn't as strong. It's not like, let me just think about sex. It's given me a [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2951.68s)]
*  little bit more space in myself to be like, well, let me think about who this person is and do I [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2958.3999999999996s)]
*  really want to engage with them. It starts to give a little bit more value to sex for me. And by that [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2963.44s)]
*  happening, intimacy is kind of created because for one, I have a little more intimacy with myself, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  right? It's like, I respect my intimacy a little bit more. I'm not just masturbating. I'm not just [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2977.52s)]
*  like, you know, tossing my intimacy off to some person through a screen or something that doesn't [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2983.12s)]
*  really mean anything to me. And so I think those are some feelings in my head that start to [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2988.96s)]
*  happen. And I start to feel a little bit more, I don't know if it's integrity, but it is a little [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2994.88s)]
*  bit more sense of intimacy with myself. That's lovely. So one of the reasons that people resort [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=2999.52s)]
*  to things like that, particularly after a breakup, is that the brain circuitry that is to do with [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3004.96s)]
*  unrequited love is relieved by certain activities because they cause the same kind of chemical [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3011.44s)]
*  cocktail. And those activities are things like alcohol, cocaine, pornography. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3019.2s)]
*  Sorry. Yeah. Well, it makes it make sense, right? This is why people go to those things. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3027.52s)]
*  Um, and obviously they're, they're addictive. So then it becomes, um, something that you need [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3033.12s)]
*  to do more of to get the same reward. Right. And that becomes your relationship. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  So then it's like, well, yeah, of course other relationships are going to be different because [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3042.56s)]
*  I don't even realize the relationships that I put in front of. Um, and the other thing is that [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3045.6s)]
*  pornography creates such an unrealistic idealized version of what a woman should look like and what [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3050.4s)]
*  she should be prepared to do in an intimate relationship or, or even not in an intimate [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3057.44s)]
*  relationship, you know, like in a one night stand or very early in dating that that's very damaging [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3062.08s)]
*  to male and female relationships as well. That, you know, the expectation that you will naturally [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3068.3199999999997s)]
*  have if you've been looking at that every day. Yeah. Oh yeah. And to not have it in my brain. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3073.12s)]
*  And it starts to my, my imagination starts to start up again. Like that's one thing that's [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3078.4s)]
*  disappeared over the years. I feel like is our imagination because we have access at anything [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3083.92s)]
*  you want to see. You want to see two gay guys attack a squirrel or whatever in a marina or [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3088.48s)]
*  whatever you can, but you can Google it right now and it'll feel, find it like anything you want to [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3092.72s)]
*  find out there. You can, it's like, we don't need our imagination. We used to have to imagine. Yeah. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3098.08s)]
*  And so that like, now my imagination starts to start up again, you know, cause, uh, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3105.44s)]
*  yeah, I'm not attaching porn to women I meet now, you know, um, and there, yeah, right there, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3112.48s)]
*  squirrel attacks, twink right there. That is, yeah. And I don't know. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3117.52s)]
*  And that might've been the rebuttal. Who knows where the first attack started, but, um, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3123.6s)]
*  but yeah, so that's something that's been really neat, uh, just on this recently that I've been [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3128.72s)]
*  doing, um, and really seeing some reward from it. And you know, what's so crazy for years, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3133.92s)]
*  I tried like different like blockers on computers and stuff. And I got started with this kind of [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3139.28s)]
*  recovery coach and he just said, why don't you text me at night? And he said, tell me something [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3145.04s)]
*  that felt good during your day. So tell me something you felt like maybe you could have done [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3150.56s)]
*  a little bit differently. Um, and then tell me how long you've been off of porn and how long you've [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3154.88s)]
*  been off of masturbation. That's for some reason that's all it took. And, and it's just been [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3159.76s)]
*  so easy. Well, it's accountability. Maybe that's it. It's like accountability with somebody that I [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3166.56s)]
*  trust or yeah, that I trust and, um, that you respect because you will feel like you've let [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3171.2799999999997s)]
*  them down if you can't keep, you know, send those messages. That's a good point. Yeah. It's funny. I [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3176.0s)]
*  didn't feel that as much, but I did. I just felt, I was shocked at how easy it started to help me, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3181.52s)]
*  you know? Um, so that's been, that's one thing that's really, that's been really nice. Um, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3187.4399999999996s)]
*  do couples, what is the chemistry that happens in the brain? If you're in a, like, if you've created [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3194.3999999999996s)]
*  a, you're in a comfortable relationship or you're, you mentioned earlier that like [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3202.24s)]
*  families have better chemistry if they sleep together, can you say something like that? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3207.2s)]
*  Or sleeping under one roof, you know? Um, like a lot of my Mexican friends are always so happy [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3211.68s)]
*  and most of their families, uh, live together. Yeah. Oh, they sleep on each other's backs. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3216.56s)]
*  Sometimes they just, you know, they're really close knit. Yeah. Um, what is, is there, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3222.24s)]
*  is there scientific evidence to back any of that up? Yeah, lots. And the research was done on, um, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3226.9599999999996s)]
*  prairie voles. Prairie like little animals. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. So prairie dog, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3232.9599999999996s)]
*  vole, not dog. Prairie vole. They call them y'all make everything fancy. We know what they are. It's [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3240.08s)]
*  not a dog. It's like a little mouse thing. Oh, it is. Well, let's see who's right. See, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3244.9599999999996s)]
*  Oh, Prairie vole. I've never seen that. Oh dang. That's rodentia. Yeah. Wow. Is that a, uh, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3250.16s)]
*  Oh, that almost looks like a little bit of a hamster or something or a little gerbil. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3256.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You don't have them. You got them. Oh, we is pronounced. I guess that maybe the J is silent [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3262.8799999999997s)]
*  or whatever. That gerbil baby. Look at them. Those are a couple. Oh, I'll make slippers out of them. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3268.08s)]
*  Bad boys. I'll make a newborn, a set of slippers with them little warm, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3276.24s)]
*  the little chunks of warmth. Make your slippers out of the marsh voles because they are promiscuous. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3280.3199999999997s)]
*  These ones are monogamous. They mate for life. Oh, they do. Oh, that's beautiful. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3286.4799999999996s)]
*  And so they studied them and they found out that these are healthier animals. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3291.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that what you're going to tell me? Um, that's a little bit oversimplified. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3294.72s)]
*  I would say that the research, so basically that they're the same kind of voles, but some of them [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3299.52s)]
*  live in the prairie and some of them live in the marsh. Okay. And in the marsh, there's plenty of [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3303.68s)]
*  food and shelter. So, you know, why not have sex with lots of other she, she voles? Cause you can. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3307.68s)]
*  It's party. It's like being in the city. Yeah. In the prairie, to make sure that you're young [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3314.7999999999997s)]
*  would survive. It's more advantageous for you to settle down with one Mrs. Vol and protect the [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3320.56s)]
*  children, protect the territory and share the job of finding food for them. So what happens in [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3326.7999999999997s)]
*  the prairie voles compared to the marsh voles is that certain receptors. So for some of the [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3333.7599999999998s)]
*  hormones we discussed, like oxytocin and vasopressin and dopamine. So if we were prairie voles rather [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3339.8399999999997s)]
*  than marsh voles, then you would get a dopamine hit every time you saw me. Okay. You would choose [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3346.16s)]
*  me over a different vol. It's not like a new strange vol. You'd say, no, I'd rather stay with [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3350.3199999999997s)]
*  my vol and you'd have higher levels of vasopressin and oxytocin. And we'd both have more receptors in [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3355.04s)]
*  the reward centers of the brain for those hormones. So we would just feel so good every time we see [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3362.8s)]
*  each other. If we saw the other one in distress, we would want to comfort them. Um, why did they [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3368.32s)]
*  create more receptors? We don't know. We don't know why it's not just that you have more of the [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3375.04s)]
*  hormone, but you have more of the receptors in certain parts of the brain. It's just, it's part [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3380.0s)]
*  of the bonding kind of like, um, increases the bonding. The fact that you've got more of the [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3384.4s)]
*  hormone and more of the receptors and it's in the reward part of the brain. But actually it's not [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3389.84s)]
*  just like if we just hung out together and looked after the babies and fed them and saw each other [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3395.1200000000003s)]
*  frequently, that would happen. But sexual activity actually intensifies the wiring. So it's kind of [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3400.32s)]
*  like the genetics and the receptors load the gun, but actually having sex pulls the trigger. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3406.48s)]
*  Interesting. Wow. So, so that's why you see if it's a, if it's a healthy family, then [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3413.1200000000003s)]
*  that's why, um, people want to be in a healthy family because it feels good. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3419.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the co-sleeping is a different thing. That's oxytocin. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3423.92s)]
*  Co-sleeping? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3428.32s)]
*  Yeah. Which is like sleeping together, like you two and the kids. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3429.12s)]
*  Are you more, is that, are those people healthier? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3432.72s)]
*  Or even just the couple sleeping together? Cause some people don't sleep together because [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3434.96s)]
*  they snore or whatever. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3438.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. I know you're talking about people in New Jersey. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3441.12s)]
*  I want to, I know it. I've been over there. The women snore too. Dang. Yeah. You're like, gosh, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3445.04s)]
*  is this a, is this my wife or is this a refinery I'm laying next to? You know, a lot of, uh. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3450.96s)]
*  Anyway, with no other issues like that, it is more healthy for you to sleep together because [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3457.2799999999997s)]
*  you increase both levels, both of your levels of oxytocin will go up. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3462.72s)]
*  So you feel better. Your brain feels better. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3465.92s)]
*  Totally. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3469.44s)]
*  Sleeping with someone that it cares about or just anyone? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3470.48s)]
*  You would get some benefits of sleeping with just anyone, but it's much more if it's somebody that [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3475.12s)]
*  you care about and that you love. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3480.3199999999997s)]
*  And if a family's closer together, do you guys, there's a, uh, that's even more. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3482.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Indian families like Mexican families sleep together. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3488.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3491.52s)]
*  Or at least one of the children, let's say there's a widowed grandparent, one of them is a [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3492.08s)]
*  child. One of the grandchildren would sleep with them. So no one sleeps alone. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3497.12s)]
*  Wow. That's pretty cool. Are there animals that do that as well? That we, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3504.48s)]
*  do you think that we learned that from? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3507.7599999999998s)]
*  All animals do that. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3509.12s)]
*  They do? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3510.4s)]
*  Well, some, obviously some animals like snow leopards, they're completely independent. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3511.12s)]
*  They don't even stay with their children after a certain age. I know it's really sad. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3515.8399999999997s)]
*  But most animals will, will sleep together. And so there's a few things that go on there. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3521.04s)]
*  One is that you actually share your gut microbiome. So we have an oral microbiome, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3526.88s)]
*  a skin microbiome and a gut microbiome, which are the good bacteria that help us, um, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3532.32s)]
*  not just to digest and help our mental health, but also contribute to our immunity. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3537.92s)]
*  So if we ate together, kissed, slept together, then I'm guessing I've got a better gut [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3543.6s)]
*  microbiome than you. I would actually donate healthy cells to you as part of a relationship. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3549.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3553.52s)]
*  Yeah. And improve your immunity. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3554.0s)]
*  Wow. So there's a lot of value in, in being close to someone and, and [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3556.4s)]
*  there's a lot of neuroscience, scientific value. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I didn't, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3564.16s)]
*  I guess it makes sense. You know, it certainly makes sense. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3570.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, we had to be part of a tribe to survive when we lived in the cave, right? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3573.2799999999997s)]
*  For sure. And if you ever seen like a group of puppies or whatever, somebody has like a [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3576.64s)]
*  box of dogs or whatever, you know, they always look like it's so, if you see them all right there [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3580.72s)]
*  by the mom, it looks like the funnest thing in the world. Even just looking at a puppy with big [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3585.04s)]
*  eyes would make you release oxytocin. God. Then I need to start dating animals then. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3590.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know what you guys' laws are, but might have to come over there to do it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3596.8s)]
*  But here's some of the world's most solitary animals right here. Platypus. Yeah. I could see [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3601.84s)]
*  that kind of maybe polar bear. That's sad, man, because it's so cold and they're just up there. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3607.2799999999997s)]
*  And polar bears, every video you see a polar bear, it's like the polar bears looking for food. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3612.8s)]
*  It's just like, God, like. And the ice cubes amount, ice cubes. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3617.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. It's always. Did I say ice cubes? Well, okay. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3621.92s)]
*  It's floating on like a little, it's floating on like, you know, four grams of ice or whatever. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3623.44s)]
*  And it's just like, it's a, God, it just seems like a horrible life. Snow leopard, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3628.2400000000002s)]

*  Snow leopards are beautiful. I think I feel like I would want to be one, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3638.8s)]
*  but I wouldn't want to be on my own. You'd have to be though. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3642.5600000000004s)]
*  I'll just be a regular leopard then. That's fair. Okay. You're allowed, miss. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3646.5600000000004s)]
*  First of all, I'd like to say thank you to Dan Morgan and everyone over at Morgan and Morgan. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3652.8s)]
*  We had an issue with Kai the hitchhiker and he filed a lawsuit against us and [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3659.52s)]
*  he made quite a hullabaloo, but Morgan and Morgan stuck with it until finally our case was dismissed. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3664.8799999999997s)]
*  Morgan and Morgan is America's largest injury law firm. They have over 100 offices nationwide [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3672.96s)]

*  Morgan and Morgan has a proven track record of fighting to get you full and fair compensation. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3686.56s)]
*  Submitting an injury claim with Morgan and Morgan is so easy. If you've ever been injured, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3692.32s)]

*  go to forthepeople.com slash this past weekend or dial pound law, pound five two nine from your [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3704.96s)]

*  from your cell. This is a paid advertisement. What is it about love today that makes it seem [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3724.24s)]
*  like you think it's harder to find or am I just romanticizing it? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3729.84s)]
*  I think that one of the reasons is that we're living so much longer. So to be honest, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3734.64s)]
*  in cave times where all we had to do was survive to reproduce our genes, you and I, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3739.68s)]
*  it wouldn't be worth us being alive anymore at the ages that we're at now. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3747.36s)]
*  Now that we're living much longer and the divorce rates are like 50%, people are looking for that [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3752.96s)]
*  second long relationship or even third long relationship that they might have in their life. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3761.12s)]
*  So I think it's just very hard. Obviously people did stay together for like 50 plus years or [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3765.84s)]
*  whatever. I just think society has changed. It's all about sort of instant ratification [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3772.72s)]
*  and short-termism and our attention spans have changed because of the internet and smartphones [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3778.64s)]
*  and apps and things like that. And it's just become more socially acceptable as well. So [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3784.24s)]
*  in many cultures, they still won't divorce, but the cultures that we exist in, it's kind of [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3790.24s)]
*  quite normal now. It's a swap meet. Yeah. It's very much a swap meet it feels like. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3798.0s)]
*  Yeah. I know you talked about maybe coming out of the pandemic that people would sense a return [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3803.04s)]
*  maybe to faith. Is there any proof that having faith and higher power has a positive effect on [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3808.08s)]
*  your brain? Yeah. So having a moderate amount of faith or some sort of spiritual belief [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3813.7599999999998s)]
*  is beneficial for the brain, but having none or too much like fundamentalism is actually not good [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3819.7599999999998s)]
*  for your brain. Really? How does having too much affect your brain negatively? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3825.28s)]
*  Well, it might become associated with certain levels of paranoia or mistrust or sort of survival [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3833.7599999999998s)]
*  emotions like anger or hatred or fear, because it kind of often means that you have to be against [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3840.16s)]
*  someone. Right. Right. So when you get to the point where you're against somebody [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3845.44s)]
*  or where you're so for just one thing that you're then inherently against other things, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3850.6400000000003s)]
*  it can get, it's not as healthy for you. You advise, like in your work, you advise like a [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3856.32s)]
*  lot of very like powerful people, you know, because I know that you have worked with like a lot of [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3864.2400000000002s)]
*  a lot of the powers in the world will come to you to help them. What are problems that powerful [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3870.0s)]
*  people have and successful people have like that maybe would surprise us, do you think? If you can, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3877.84s)]
*  you don't have to get specific, but if you want to share anything. Well, the first thing I will say [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3884.24s)]
*  is that the problems are pretty much exactly the same, you know, whether it was a patient I saw in [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3888.48s)]
*  the National Health Service as a doctor or, you know, as it is now as an executive advisor to like [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3894.0s)]
*  very senior people. And because I'm a stress expert, I do tend to see people who are managing [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3900.88s)]
*  really high levels of stress and complexity. And they're also traveling a lot. So their sleep [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3907.92s)]
*  might be really disrupted. They often don't really believe in sleeping that much anyway. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3912.8s)]
*  So it's all those sort of habits like people who don't get enough sleep who, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3917.44s)]
*  I mean, they would tend to eat well because they can afford to, but they might not be eating in [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3921.68s)]
*  what I call like a brain first approach. So they might be eating because they want to run a marathon [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3927.6s)]
*  or because they can afford expensive things, but that's not necessarily what's best for your brain. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3933.2000000000003s)]
*  So I can help them with that. Really is eating certain ways better for your brain? Because yeah, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3938.56s)]
*  I find most of the time I eat just because I have to. Like if I didn't have to eat, I would, a lot [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3943.84s)]
*  of times I would just keep working or doing something, you know, and I don't eat like a lot [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3949.6s)]
*  of variety of stuff. Yeah, I don't, I'm not a foodie, I guess, you know, I maybe would be once I get [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3954.56s)]
*  married or something, if my wife wants to get something or order something, then I would try [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3959.8399999999997s)]
*  something like, like more new or something. But I just like, I just usually make a quesadilla or [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3963.6s)]
*  have a smoothie because it's easy. Wow. So you wait till you're hungry and then just eat something [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3970.0s)]
*  because you have to. Yeah, that's kind of how I am. It's a little bit, it's kind of sad to me. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3974.64s)]
*  It's kind of sad really, but it's okay. Maybe it's because you don't know that even though [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3979.2s)]
*  your brain is such a small percentage of your body weight, it uses up 20 to 30% of everything [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3984.96s)]
*  that you eat. Really? Yeah. Your brain does? Yeah. Wow. So when you're asleep, your brain's using up [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3990.24s)]
*  20% of what you ate that day. What a peefer. It's just energy hungry. That's what we would call it. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=3996.8799999999997s)]
*  And so when you're, when you're, you know, really focused on something like this, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4004.08s)]
*  you're probably using up about 25%. But if you're under a lot of stress, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4008.48s)]
*  your brain will take up 30% of what you're eating. Wow. What is, what happens to our brain while [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4011.92s)]
*  we're sleeping? So the brain, you know, we know quite a lot more about it now than we did, let's [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4017.2s)]
*  say 20, 30 years ago, but we don't know everything. So we actually don't. Well, we've only recently [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4022.32s)]
*  understood why we need to sleep for eight to nine hours. And that's because that cleaning process, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4027.44s)]
*  I mentioned. Nine now? Well, eight hours and 15 minutes is the ideal in the, in the sort of [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4032.8s)]
*  population norm studies. Let's round it up. I'll take nine if we're willing to do it. Nine in bed [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4037.92s)]
*  so that you get at least seven to eight hours of sleep. Yeah. Because that cleansing process [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4044.0800000000004s)]
*  takes seven to eight hours and that process is flushing out toxins that are exactly the same [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4049.84s)]
*  pathologies that we see in dementia and Alzheimer's and things like that. So, and they build up [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4055.84s)]
*  due to the daily wear and tear of life stress and alcohol and, you know, processed food and all that [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4061.68s)]
*  kind of thing. I know there's a big debate in this country at the moment about ultra processed food, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4067.68s)]
*  but from a brain point of view, don't eat it. Really? Yeah. It's really bad for you. Really bad. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4071.7599999999998s)]
*  Like what are some of the effects that that processed foods have on your brain? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4079.2s)]
*  Well, everything comes down to inflammation. So these ultra processed foods, for your body to [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4083.04s)]
*  break them down, is going to cause a lot of like cell activity. And then it's also leaving the waste [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4088.48s)]
*  products from that food in for your body to get rid of. And this is going to cause some of the cells [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4096.32s)]
*  to become inflamed. And when your body's under stress and that's the only nutrition that it's [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4101.76s)]
*  getting, then basically your cortisol levels go up and that crosses the blood brain barrier. So it [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4106.8s)]
*  supplies blood to the whole brain and body and it will just cause inflammation in your gut. Your [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4114.08s)]
*  gut talks to your brain all the time. Your brain talks to your gut. Gossiping. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4118.8s)]
*  You know, but that's good. It's actually a three way gossip because your gut microbiome is also [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4127.44s)]
*  signals to the gut and the brain separately. Wow. So your brain is super busy, huh? If it can have [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4133.28s)]
*  such an effect, then what are the things you recommend that you would eat? I mean, obviously [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4140.56s)]
*  some of it seems kind of obvious or things you would or wouldn't. So I would suggest, this is [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4145.280000000001s)]
*  ideal, ideal, okay? This is what I do, but it's taken me years to get to this point. I eat 30 [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4151.04s)]
*  different plant products per week. Now that can include coffee, dark chocolate, spices. So [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4156.96s)]
*  especially like if you eat a lot of Mexican food, it's actually not as hard as you think to do that, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4162.88s)]
*  but you do need to vary the sort of vegetables that you're using. In South America, they actually [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4167.44s)]
*  call squash, beans and corn the three sisters and attribute that to the blue zones of longevity in [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4174.48s)]
*  parts of South America. Then you do need to eat some good quality protein. So lean proteins like [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4182.24s)]
*  eggs, yogurt, tofu. Fish, can we do fish? Fish. Can we have it? Yeah. Oh good. Fish. Yeah, I like fish. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4192.0s)]
*  I like having fish a lot. Yeah, even like. And it looks cool if you see it in the water because [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4202.8s)]
*  that's the only thing I don't like. You have a thing about fish. You think? Yeah. Maybe I do. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4207.04s)]
*  But cows, you look at him and you're like, this thing is dumb as fuck. I'm not eating this thing. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4211.76s)]
*  That's how I feel a lot of times, you know, especially the one with the bell on his neck or [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4215.2s)]
*  whatever. You're like, this one's dumb, but at least he's trying to party. But it's like, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4219.4400000000005s)]
*  it's like cows. I know people are like meat eaters. You got to eat them. But [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4223.2s)]
*  sometimes I look at a cow and I'm like, dang man, this, I don't want to be eating this thing. It [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4229.04s)]
*  just seems kind of dumb, you know, no offense to cows either, but you know what I'm saying? Kind of [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4234.24s)]
*  just like, they're just standing there, you know, there is ease could easily be victims of crime or [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4239.68s)]
*  whatever, but a fish, you know, it just looks like that's how I would like to be, you know? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4245.84s)]
*  Okay. So if you'd be an animal, you'd be a fish. Yeah. Or just something more exciting, you know, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4250.16s)]
*  I'd have, yeah. So I start, sometimes I think like, oh, I should eat things that are like things that [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4253.84s)]
*  I want to be like, maybe that would be cool. That's actually cool because I tried to eat things [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4257.52s)]
*  that look like a brain, like a cauliflower or a Walnut. Oh, really? Wow. That's cool. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4261.28s)]
*  Anyway, it kind of makes sense that it would help it. A Walnut looks just like a brain. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4269.28s)]
*  That's crazy. Yeah. And if you cut a cauliflower in half, it looks exactly like a brain too. Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4274.24s)]
*  Wow. And then the good fats, we can't forget the good fats for the brain. So that is your oily fish, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4281.44s)]
*  avocado, eggs, nuts, seeds, olive oil, all that kind of thing. And then dark skinned foods are [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4288.08s)]
*  better for your brain than regular colored foods. So purple sprouting broccoli instead of green [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4296.48s)]
*  broccoli, blueberries instead of raspberries, because that purple color has antioxidants in the [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4302.24s)]
*  skin of the food called anthocyanins, which really help with neuroplasticity. You know, that process [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4312.639999999999s)]
*  we talked about of changing your brain. So, you know, I tried to eat kind of, I tried to take the [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4317.44s)]
*  purple version of everything, but basically quite just like saying dark skinned stuff is better for [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4322.88s)]
*  you. Well, I mean, yeah, I think I've heard, yeah, I mean, I got BLM. I mean, people like [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4327.84s)]
*  different things. You know, you gotta, you know, everybody likes somebody, somebody. Yeah. My friend [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4335.4400000000005s)]
*  only dates brothers, honestly. And yes, and there's a lot of value in that. So yeah, I could certainly [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4341.92s)]
*  see that. So yeah, explain it. Actually, can I share a story that is a really, really kind of [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4350.56s)]
*  important one that had a massive impact on me? And I, I would like to share it because I think [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4356.64s)]
*  it could really help people. Yeah, I would love to hear it. So standing on the street outside my [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4361.360000000001s)]
*  house, waiting for a taxi and a young blonde woman walked past me, but then I could see out of the [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4365.12s)]
*  corner of my eye that she stopped and turned around and came up to me. And she said, are you Tara Swart? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4373.200000000001s)]
*  And I said, yes. And she said, you saved my life. And I was a bit taken aback. So I said, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4378.8s)]
*  you know, what was it that I said that resonated with you? Because I feel like I can speak so [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4386.320000000001s)]
*  broadly that I don't always know what it is. And she said, I struggled with a really serious eating [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4390.08s)]
*  disorder for years. And I heard you say that you choose what you eat because it impacts your brain [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4395.280000000001s)]
*  and it immediately changed my relationship with food. And I have heard, I mean, when I was a [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4400.72s)]
*  psychiatrist, the eating disorders ward was like a hopeless case. There was, there was really not [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4406.64s)]
*  much we could do. And I've heard that recently the latest way of dealing with eating disorders [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4412.24s)]
*  is tying people to their beds and forcing them to eat. And I can't believe that's helpful for [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4418.24s)]
*  anyone. But just hearing this person say that one thing I said changed her life so dramatically was [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4422.08s)]
*  kind of, just made me feel like everything I've done has brought me to the right place. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4428.88s)]
*  Well, that's wonderful. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, it's so powerful if somebody comes [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4433.12s)]
*  up and you can tell they're being real or genuine, you know, and they share something with you. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4438.16s)]
*  You must get that. I meet a lot of people and sometimes, you know, it's like, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4443.5199999999995s)]
*  and sometimes there's moments where you're like, oh, this is really cool, you know, and it's like, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4447.92s)]
*  you can share and sometimes you'll be having a bad day and they'll tell you something that they heard [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4451.36s)]
*  you say that helped them. And you're like, well, shit, tell it back to me right now. I know, same. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4456.08s)]
*  You know, it's like, well, look, thank you for coming back and telling me because it's like the [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4460.24s)]
*  exact thing I needed to hear right now. Sometimes people, my friends send me a page, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4464.88s)]
*  a photo of a page from my book and they're like, you wrote this, like, why are you being like this [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4469.04s)]
*  now? I know it's so hard to help ourselves a lot of times, but that's why we need each other. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4472.88s)]
*  You know, my friend James Bushara, he always says that we're the keys to each other's locks, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4478.32s)]
*  actually. Oh, I love that. I think you might have done, did you do a podcast in Venice one day? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4482.0s)]
*  You ever do one in Venice? Maybe with Sahara Rose. It hasn't come out yet. No, this was with a man [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4486.8s)]
*  Senj. Oh, Drew Purahet. No, it was an Indian man. Yeah, he's Indian. He is? Yeah. Yeah, maybe it was [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4495.04s)]
*  him. Yeah. Was it in Venice, do you think? It was in LA. It was in LA? Yeah. It looked like my friend [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4501.68s)]
*  James's studio. I saw someone, I was like, oh, that kind of looked like James's studio. Cause he, I [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4506.96s)]
*  thought, I didn't know if I have no idea if it was or not. It looked a little similar. Okay. Let me [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4510.88s)]
*  ask you a question. Okay. Did you know that we actually have a second nose that's not connected [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4515.84s)]
*  to the brain? Uh-uh. We have a second nose more than the one on our face? Yeah. Okay. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4521.68s)]
*  It's called the vomeronasal organ and it detects the smells of things that when you eat them, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4527.76s)]
*  they give off a vapor like a spicy food and actually connects to your heart and makes your [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4534.88s)]
*  heart rate go up, but it doesn't connect directly to your brain. And dogs have them. It's got a [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4538.96s)]
*  special name in dogs, which I can't remember, but that's why they can smell pheromones. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4544.72s)]
*  And also I got this research from my colleague at MIT who, who creates artificial noses and he's [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4549.12s)]
*  created an artificial nose that can detect prostate cancer before any of our current diagnostic [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4556.799999999999s)]
*  tests can. And get this, this, this might cause some trouble for some people that, you know, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4563.2s)]
*  it can detect pregnancy earlier than any test at the moment. And it can tell who the father is. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4570.08s)]
*  Oh my God. So it's going to be like snorri povich or whatever. What are they going to [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4578.4s)]
*  put the nose on? I don't know. How do they do it? They just hold it up to something? Yeah. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4585.679999999999s)]
*  And what's it made out of? I think titanium, but it's, it's connected to a machine, obviously. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4591.92s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Wow. So it's a robotic nose that can tell if you have cancer and can tell if you're [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4598.4s)]
*  pregnant and tell who the father is. What? Oh, I wonder how expensive it is. Hopefully you can [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4603.52s)]
*  just put a dollar in the back of it and find out. Nano nose. Here you go. Earlier this year, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4611.200000000001s)]
*  Mershon and his team- Yeah, Mershon. He's my friend. They had created a nano nose, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4616.0s)]
*  a robotic nose powered by AI that could identify cases of prostate cancer from urine samples [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4619.84s)]
*  with 70% accuracy. Wow. So really like a real piss sommelier or something they would call it, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4624.4800000000005s)]
*  urine sommelier. Wow. The nano nose. What else can it do? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4630.4s)]
*  Early detection of lung cancer. They'll start going across the cancers. So cats and dogs in [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4639.76s)]
*  old people's homes, they go and sit outside the door of the person that's dying. And that's [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4646.4s)]
*  because cell death starts to happen before you actually die. And it happens in a certain order [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4651.2s)]
*  and they can smell when that's happening. That's crazy. Andreas Mershon also told me something, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4656.24s)]
*  but I can't remember why. So I'm going to say it on this podcast so I can send him the link and [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4663.04s)]
*  then ask him to explain. Okay. Which is that if you inject rabbits with urine from pregnant women, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4667.12s)]
*  they get their period. No. Wow. If you inject them with urine from pregnant women, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4676.5599999999995s)]
*  they get their period. Man. So next time a pregnant woman's like, I'm not a problem. I'll be [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4685.2s)]
*  like, yeah, but you obviously are into some, you got sorcery running through your body right now. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4693.92s)]
*  Cause that's crazy. That's crazy to think that. I've never seen anything like that. I wouldn't [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4699.12s)]
*  even do it to anybody. And early, go back to that nano nose. I want to see what else it can do. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4704.16s)]
*  That's fascinating to me. And do they have, do they show any use of that nano nose? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4709.36s)]
*  Yeah. For cancer and pregnancy. I'm just wondering, do they, is it, do they, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4716.0s)]
*  do they have it on the end of the stick? How it's actually used. Yeah. He also told me that way more [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4721.04s)]
*  women are super smellers than, than men. Really? Yeah. I could bet that. Cause also women are, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4727.5199999999995s)]
*  I think over life, they're like the chefs and they do like the more of like the, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4732.48s)]
*  they have to smell if the kids okay or whatever, probably. Do you think that's why? Yeah, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4737.04s)]
*  I think so. It makes sense. Okay. Accurate electric nose accurately sniffs out hard to [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4741.12s)]
*  detect cancers and odor based tests that sniffs out vapors emanating from blood samples was able [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4745.759999999999s)]
*  to distinguish between benign and pancreatic and ovarian cancer with up to 95% accuracy. That's [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4751.44s)]
*  crazy. But Theo wants to see a picture of what it, how they use it, like what it looks like when [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4757.919999999999s)]
*  they're actually sniffing patients. And there's a one in five chance for a preventive medical [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4763.6s)]
*  checkup. The late detection of prostate cancer often means the removal of a part or the whole [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4773.52s)]
*  organ. There's hope at the park scientific to Barcelona. Wow. That's incredible. Um, where does [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4780.160000000001s)]
*  our intuition and our gut instincts come from? That's one of my favorite questions. Is it really? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4788.56s)]
*  Yeah. I love intuition. It's like my superpower. Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, so basically, cause it's so [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4795.04s)]
*  cool. It's kind of this, it's like this ghost that's in us a little bit. Yeah. Kind of, yeah. The [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4801.04s)]
*  ghost of wisdom or something. I mean, Andreas Mershon also said to me that things like extra [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4806.080000000001s)]
*  sensory perception, they're not woo woo that he was actually comparing that to the fact that most [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4810.56s)]
*  people don't know we have the second nose. He was like, there's science about it. We just haven't [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4817.04s)]
*  discovered it all yet. Yeah. So intuition was a bit like that. It people didn't, cause they couldn't [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4821.28s)]
*  see it. It wasn't tangible. They didn't really take it that seriously. Like I've been teaching at MIT [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4826.72s)]
*  for over 10 years now. And 10 years ago, senior leaders would say, that's not a sense I would use [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4831.28s)]
*  at work. You know, I'm not going to use that for hire or fire, but then actually the older, wiser [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4837.68s)]
*  guys would say, that's exactly the one I use for hire or fire. Cause you know, I've learned over [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4841.84s)]
*  time to trust it. Yeah. So I honed my intuition by journaling and reading over my journal and [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4845.84s)]
*  writing down every decision that I made. If like logic told me one thing and intuition told me [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4852.8s)]
*  another, and I decided to trust my intuition more and more. She really mapped it out. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4858.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think I was naturally quite intuitive, but sometimes I was afraid to trust it when I felt [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4863.28s)]
*  like something else was the right thing to do logically. So what we need to live our normal life [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4869.04s)]
*  is called our working memory. And it's stored in the outer cortex of the brain. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4876.0s)]
*  And then our sort of beliefs and thought patterns, you know, sort of what we were discussing earlier [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4879.84s)]
*  on that's in systems in the limbic part of the brain, which is the shape and size of your [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4884.72s)]
*  clenched fist. So obviously yours is bigger than mine. And the cortex is around it. And then [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4890.96s)]
*  through a process called Hebbian learning, which is named after the neuroscientist Donald Hebb, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4897.360000000001s)]
*  because you can't remember everything that you've experienced in your life, but you have [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4901.76s)]
*  experienced it. So that information, like neurons that fire together, wire together, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4905.4400000000005s)]
*  gets stored deeper in your spinal cord and your gut neurons. And that's why intuition is [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4910.72s)]
*  sometimes called gut instinct. Oh, so that's why you kind of feel right there. You kind of go there [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4915.6s)]
*  in your brain, like, what is my gut telling me to do? Yeah, like butterflies in your stomach tells [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4921.280000000001s)]
*  you that you're nervous, right? Yeah. But the sense of like, this is the right thing to do. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4924.88s)]
*  This is the right thing for me to do. Or this is the right person for me to date that might, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4931.36s)]
*  you might not feel it viscerally, but you'll just get that sense. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4936.08s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Cause like over time, it's like, yeah, you have to believe that your [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4940.719999999999s)]
*  intuition gets honed as well because of you've had experiences. Yeah. But it can also actually [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4945.599999999999s)]
*  in a really important point is that neuroplasticity can be a bad thing. If you repeatedly go for, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4952.24s)]
*  you know, people that it ends up being a toxic relationship and you have a breakup that drags [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4959.12s)]
*  out and damages you and then you don't really heal and you just go back into a similar type [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4965.76s)]
*  of relationship, you're going to kind of, that's your intuition telling you the wrong thing, right? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4970.16s)]
*  Right. But you're following it. Yeah. So you could actually, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4975.76s)]
*  you could mold your intuition negatively as well. Yeah. Oh, wow. Like obsessing over breakup. That's [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4978.88s)]
*  that's neuroplasticity. Yeah. Yeah. I used to do that, man. That was the worst. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4984.16s)]
*  God, I would be so heartbroken. The most heartbroken fricking weirdo ever did [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4990.72s)]
*  smoking or whatever, just walking around the neighborhood. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=4995.599999999999s)]
*  What else? How do we change our perspective? How do we use, is our perspective our brain? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5000.4s)]
*  So this is called the hard problem of neuroscience. And that is the question of whether our brain is [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5008.24s)]
*  our mind or our mind is our brain. And basically, if we're being very scientific, then our [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5013.76s)]
*  consciousness, which is everything that we think and feel arises from neurons and chemicals that [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5021.52s)]
*  are physically part of our brain. There's a big move more recently, and this has happened in the [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5028.08s)]
*  past in ancient times, we believed in seers and shamans and mystics and, you know, things like [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5034.96s)]
*  clairvoyance and claircognizance and things like that. And we've moved away from that in modern [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5043.76s)]
*  times. Yeah, we believe in like a lot more astrology, the moon, that sort of thing as well. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5048.0s)]
*  Yeah. But science is now starting to look at some of this ancient wisdom in a way that we may have [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5052.56s)]
*  actually forgotten things that we knew before that are crucial to our mental health in the modern [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5058.72s)]
*  world. So I mentioned some of those things already, like drumming and chanting. But what we believe now [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5063.52s)]
*  is that our brain might actually be filtering our consciousness down so that we can survive in this [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5071.76s)]
*  material world. But actually, our minds are capable of a lot more than what we think now. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5077.04s)]
*  So in terms of perspective, that is all the filters that your childhood and your upbringing [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5084.16s)]
*  have put on how you see the world. And you can absolutely challenge your perspective. It's not [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5090.24s)]
*  your brain. It's a version of reality that your brain's creating. And I have some really favourite [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5094.56s)]
*  exercises that I have that people can do at home. So one is if I have a dilemma, or particularly if [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5100.96s)]
*  I'm really struggling and just feeling like things aren't going to work out, I describe myself sitting [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5107.04s)]
*  here, what I'm wearing at my age, and I ask the question, like, what should I do? Or, you know, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5114.16s)]
*  what's going to happen to me? Like, you know, when you're really kind of a bit desperate, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5119.44s)]
*  and then I get up and I walk seven steps, and I turn around and I say, I'm Tara, seven years older [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5123.2s)]
*  than you. And I've seen what happens in your life in the next seven years. And I answer the question, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5128.8s)]
*  I give advice. So that's kind of like, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5135.04s)]
*  that's pretty cool. Thanks. Because you're kind of putting yourself in a place and then you're, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5139.76s)]
*  you're using your same self, and my intuition, and your intuition, and who even knows what, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5145.76s)]
*  what powers the world grants you if you say, okay, now I'm going to put myself seven years ahead and [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5152.4800000000005s)]
*  speak back to myself. Yeah, there's, it often feels like there's so many hidden abilities that [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5159.120000000001s)]
*  we have that we just don't know about yet. Like, even with like five senses, it's like, I bet there's [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5164.8s)]
*  30 senses, we just don't even know some of what they are yet. There's up to 33. Is there really? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5170.4800000000005s)]
*  I went to. They told us there's five. Did they tell you that, dude? Well, not at medical school. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5175.84s)]
*  At medical school, I obviously knew there's more than five, but I didn't know there's like [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5183.12s)]
*  22 to 33. They don't trust us with them, dude. I think, yeah, you got it. I guess if you go to [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5186.88s)]
*  school, you get more senses. You don't get more, you've got them as well. You've got [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5192.4s)]
*  crone deception. You understand the passing of time. You've got. I got five, but they give you [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5199.12s)]
*  five senses. Yeah. Right. Touch, feel. Touch and feel are the same. Okay. Sorry. My bad doc. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5203.76s)]
*  Touch. Taste. Taste, smell, sight. Hearing. And hearing. Yeah. Sorry. But there's more than that. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5211.76s)]
*  Way more. Unreal. Wow. That'd be cool to go through all of them one day. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5220.64s)]
*  Whenever I come to your country, we'll have to go through all of them. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5227.84s)]
*  Okay. What country do you live in? London? Yeah. London's not a country. It isn't? No, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5230.08s)]
*  it's a city. Oh yeah. Told you guys, huh? Enough with the attitude. All right. Yeah. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5235.84s)]
*  Manchester's the real England. I'm joking. Well, people think different things. Wow. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5241.6s)]
*  So your perspective, you can do that exercise or you can ask yourself, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5248.08s)]
*  what advice would I give my brother? Because it's just about taking yourself one step out [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5252.0s)]
*  of the situation that you're in. Cause then you can't see the wood for the trees. You know? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5256.4s)]
*  Yeah. You're stuck in shit. You're stuck in yourself. But yeah, what advice would I give [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5259.679999999999s)]
*  my brother? That's a great idea. What advice would I give my sister? What advice? Cause it is crazy. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5263.04s)]
*  You'll give them the best advice. Then you'll get off the phone and do the worst thing. Yeah. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5268.0s)]
*  Yeah. Totally. That's so fascinating. I mean, because some of my advice is like pinned on [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5271.759999999999s)]
*  social media, me and my girlfriend were laughing so much about some of the things that I say. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5278.32s)]
*  And then in my real life, I'm like, why is this happening to me? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5283.04s)]
*  I know. It's so funny. I think we all take turns being something that someone needs to hear, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5289.44s)]
*  you know? Even in the sense that somebody came up to me in the airport and was telling me something [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5295.2s)]
*  like, Oh man, where'd you hear that? And like, you said that. I'm like, well, I needed to hear [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5298.64s)]
*  that right now. It's like, we all kind of take turns even throughout the day, throughout the [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5303.44s)]
*  moment, throughout the years, being each other's champions at certain little moments. You know? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5307.44s)]
*  I think that that's pretty remarkable. That's kind of a gift. You've talked a lot about like [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5311.6s)]
*  manifesting and stuff. Do you really believe in it? A hundred percent. Yeah. I've been [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5317.120000000001s)]
*  actively doing it myself kind of personally for 15 or 16 years. And then in 2019, my book, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5321.84s)]
*  The Source came out where I shared that more professionally. And the response to that was [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5327.6s)]
*  actually quite phenomenal in making me believe in it even more. Wow. It's a best seller. Yeah. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5332.72s)]
*  Congratulations. Thank you. So cool. Thanks. So cool to write a book and like, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5338.5599999999995s)]
*  and have people want to absorb it. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about that manifesting because we [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5343.44s)]
*  forget about it. We forget sometimes that we're the captain of the ship. Sometimes we just feel like [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5348.24s)]
*  the stream owns everything, you know? Yeah. And I think some versions of manifestation can still [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5354.0s)]
*  make people feel like that because it's about the universe and vibrations. I wanted to explain [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5359.28s)]
*  manifestation through psychology and neuroscience in a way to say, look, it's your brain that's [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5364.0s)]
*  doing it. It's not some outside force. And I think that's way more empowering. And that's what people [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5370.4s)]
*  really liked about it that I write a lot about vision boards, but I call them action boards [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5376.96s)]
*  because I say, you can't just create a fantasy and then sit at home and wait for it to come true. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5382.32s)]
*  Like look at how hard you've worked to get to where you are. It's very easy for people to say, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5386.08s)]
*  oh, I'd love to have the O'Barnes life, but you've really struggled and worked really hard to get here. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5390.64s)]
*  So I absolutely say that that has to be part of it. It can't just be expecting like things to fall [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5397.04s)]
*  out of the sky and come into your life. Right. But if you know, manifestation is basically setting [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5403.280000000001s)]
*  goals and desires, knowing what you want, finding images of them to put on a board that you can see [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5407.92s)]
*  at least twice a day. And if it's only once a day, then seeing it just before you go to sleep, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5413.6s)]
*  because it imprints on your subconscious and it can be very literal or it can be metaphorical, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5418.4s)]
*  like something that, you know, you could have a horse on there and it could mean one thing to you [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5423.92s)]
*  and something else to me, for example. And basically I ask people to make this board, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5427.679999999999s)]
*  look at it daily, visualize these things being true because your brain doesn't actually know [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5433.679999999999s)]
*  the difference between something happening in real life and a strong visualization. And then, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5438.4s)]
*  yeah. And you won't be afraid of it if you've already visualized it. You won't kind of meet [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5444.88s)]
*  that dream girl and say, Oh, maybe I'm not ready. You'll have told your brain that you're ready to [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5449.68s)]
*  take a healthy risk. Wow. So your brain doesn't really know the difference between, say that again, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5455.52s)]
*  between something that happened in real life or something that you strongly visualize. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5462.96s)]
*  Wow. It's the same reason why when we watch a movie or something, we're able to get lost in it. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5468.88s)]
*  We're able to believe in it because it, wow. So you could create enough of a visualization [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5472.32s)]
*  for yourself if you really were to powerfully start to focus on it and do that and build that [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5477.12s)]
*  ability to visualize something that your brain at one point would have to think it's so true [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5483.04s)]
*  that the world would meet you and put it into your life. I love the way you put that. Wow. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5490.32s)]
*  Wow. Dude, that's crazy. And it feels, that's what feels like another sense that, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5494.56s)]
*  that to me feels like another sense that it like 200 years from now, they're going to be like, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5500.8s)]
*  people are just going to be manifested. It's just everything, you know, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5506.56s)]
*  everything is going to be so over manifested. But you know what it is? That's one thing that [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5509.92s)]
*  I feel like there's like some elite people in the world and they really learned that. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5513.84s)]
*  So that's when I see some people who are operating at a very elite level or [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5518.56s)]
*  um, the deep state or whatever, I start thinking, oh, they, that's what they're using [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5522.72s)]
*  to the best of their ability. Wow. Yeah. Your brain and then the world is like, oh, well, it has to [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5528.24s)]
*  have happened because they put it in there so much. That's crazy. And what kind of things can you [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5537.28s)]
*  manifest? Um, off the example, cause people write to me all the time saying what they manifested. So [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5543.92s)]
*  it could be a certain kind of home, a relationship, a family pregnancy, um, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5549.92s)]
*  their own career. A lot of it's like quitting their job and actually starting up the business [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5558.4s)]
*  that they've always wanted to do. Travel is quite a big one. Yeah. Yeah. What are some side effects [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5563.4400000000005s)]
*  of the pandemic that we never treated as a society? Cause that's fascinating to me. So it's, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5569.68s)]
*  we kind of went through it and like you said earlier, we're just now we're just here [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5575.68s)]
*  and we never looked at, I mean, even in recovery rooms, like the shutdown of all of the 12 step [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5580.4800000000005s)]
*  rooms and people couldn't go to those meetings killed, there's no way it's in kill a hundred [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5585.280000000001s)]
*  thousand people, you know, just in those. Yeah. Um, I think there were mental health issues [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5591.280000000001s)]
*  during the pandemic, but there were slightly different ones since, and we, nobody's really [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5598.8s)]
*  talking about that, which is so scary. Um, I think they involve three sorts of loss. So a loss of [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5603.52s)]
*  your sense of self and your purpose, like who am I, what direction should I be going in a breakdown [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5610.240000000001s)]
*  of relationships, whether that's marriages, other romantic relationships, working relationships, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5615.68s)]
*  friendships, people are more like disconnected and lonely. Um, some people lost a loved one and had [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5621.040000000001s)]
*  to go to it over zoom and never even got to grieve it or have the family be there together [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5628.16s)]
*  when they lost their grandmother. There are people that were hoping in the next couple of years, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5634.5599999999995s)]
*  they would find a love, a relationship. And then suddenly there's three years where they can't [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5638.4s)]
*  even date. And what was the third one? Sorry. The third one was going to be loss of actual loved [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5643.2s)]
*  ones, you know, in grief. Um, and I think one of the things I'm seeing, it may have been creeping [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5648.8s)]
*  up before the pandemic, but it feels very evident now is the world feels like a really difficult [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5655.6s)]
*  place for young men. The idea of what it means to be a man now doesn't feel clear. And, you know, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5661.4400000000005s)]
*  I've sort of had male friends say to me that, yeah, we're equal, but we're still different. And men, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5669.68s)]
*  you know, they want to love and protect someone, but it feels like women are saying, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5677.84s)]
*  I can do everything by myself now. I don't need you. Yeah. Um, so that, that feels really sad. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5682.24s)]
*  And that's, I think happening more in the younger generations than, than it did when we were that [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5688.719999999999s)]
*  age. Yeah. I think in some people start to view themselves as men and women. I think some of the [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5694.4s)]
*  gender lines and stuff are getting blurred. Like, and, and some of that I think is probably good [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5699.36s)]
*  because you want everybody to believe they can do anything, you know, because there has to be some [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5705.28s)]
*  value in being a man, just like there has to be some value in being a woman. It's, we want there [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5710.4s)]
*  to be, I don't want to be with some woman and it's a man, you know, I would like her to be a woman, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5716.48s)]
*  you know, most of the time. And so it's like, that's a thing. Like, can I put that slightly [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5725.04s)]
*  differently? Yeah. I think it's about having masculine and feminine energies, which we can [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5730.0s)]
*  both be capable of. So I think for a man, you know, men are obviously physically stronger. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5735.44s)]
*  And so there are things that men can do for women that could be helpful in terms of the fact that [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5740.96s)]
*  they've got more physical strength. Yeah. But equally men are capable of emotional intelligence [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5746.32s)]
*  and intuition. And it would be nice if that could be more balanced in, in both agendas. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5752.16s)]
*  Yeah. Cause I think in the end, I think it probably goes back to some of our nature too, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5758.4s)]
*  you know, it's like, I think we want to have someone. Sometimes it's like, if you don't have [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5762.48s)]
*  somebody, you'll start turning into the thing you want to, which is kind of weird. What do you mean? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5767.92s)]
*  I feel like sometimes if you're a, maybe you're a gal and you're having maybe trouble getting a guy [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5772.879999999999s)]
*  or you're not having success in that world, you might start kind of like, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5778.32s)]
*  maybe doing more masculine stuff, maybe doing like you'll create what you need. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5784.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I guess you have to, if you have to get on in life, you might have to do things that [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5789.84s)]
*  you didn't do if you were in partnership. Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't make any sense. Really? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5795.76s)]
*  I didn't know where you were going with that. I didn't know either. I was trying to like, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5799.120000000001s)]
*  think of an idea and I thought you were going to say something really outrageous. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5802.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, I don't, I don't know what I was going to say, but I just, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5805.040000000001s)]
*  whatever I said didn't really make any sense. Yeah. It is tough. I think it is interesting for [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5808.400000000001s)]
*  young men, you know, I think it's interesting a lot for just men these days, you know, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5812.4800000000005s)]
*  but then also there was women, like when women didn't have access to a lot of money or they [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5818.32s)]
*  didn't have money, they were taken advantage of. And so it's like, maybe this is just the, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5823.12s)]
*  the eddy of the river, the, the path of it that we have to get to get to a place where, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5829.759999999999s)]
*  you know, women have more finances and ability to make choices for their own. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5836.639999999999s)]
*  And then once they feel comfortable in that space, then they can, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5841.92s)]
*  let themselves just be women again. Does that make any sense? Or I think it's a bit more, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5845.5199999999995s)]
*  somebody's going to get upset about that. Yeah, I think it's a bit more complex than that. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5851.28s)]
*  I think we could say that both as men and women and particularly as parents of the younger [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5854.32s)]
*  generations that are coming up now into adulthood, that we have a responsibility to [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5858.5599999999995s)]
*  not emasculate men to the point that they are taking their lives because women have [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5864.5599999999995s)]
*  changed a lot. If you think since cave times, or even just since the 1950s, women have had [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5872.56s)]
*  financial independence, women have been able to use contraception, women have been able to use [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5877.92s)]
*  hair dye. It's completely changed how particularly older women can survive in society and be valued [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5882.320000000001s)]
*  in society. But men haven't really changed that much, let's say since the 1950s. So there's [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5888.320000000001s)]
*  obviously some sort of evolution or adaptation that needs to happen. And I think that's a [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5896.080000000001s)]
*  evolution or adaptation that needs to happen because things were so unfair before, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5900.24s)]
*  but I just think we've got to do it in a way that isn't unfair now, if you know what I mean? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5905.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Navigate it together in a way that men and women can be in harmony. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5910.0s)]
*  Because when the Me Too sort of conversations first came out, obviously there were a lot of [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5915.84s)]
*  women that were saying all the bad things about men that they could. And I just kept repeating [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5921.04s)]
*  the same thing. We have to remember most men are good. There's no value in us suddenly hating men [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5925.76s)]
*  because this Me Too movement has come up. That's not going to help any gender. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5931.92s)]
*  Yeah. And that was a huge thing. Every man, men were scared to look at women, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5936.64s)]
*  men were scared to pat a woman on the back even. It was definitely getting real risque out there. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5940.8s)]
*  I think even things like, should I hold the door open for a woman or not is a confusing [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5946.64s)]
*  decision for men these days. Oh, I agree. I'll be on an airplane and a woman will maybe be about [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5951.12s)]
*  to lift her bag and put it up. And it's like, I don't know. Am I going to get the lady who's like, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5954.48s)]
*  I can do it myself? Or am I just going to get the lady who was like, thank you, or just lets me feel [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5960.08s)]
*  good because I can do it and I'm able to help out? Not that she can't do it. For a lot of guys, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5966.959999999999s)]
*  it wasn't that you can't do it. It was like, we want to do it. We want to be of service. We want [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5971.919999999999s)]
*  to be able to show off a little bit, give us something we can do. Yeah. And I love it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5977.759999999999s)]
*  I think it's great. Yeah. I have this joke. This is a long time I forgot about this. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5984.5599999999995s)]
*  It was like, I was talking about women want to be men. Now, you see women that are dead lifting [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5989.44s)]
*  weights and I'll be like, if you put down the barbells and you look lost for a minute, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=5995.2s)]
*  then a guy will show right up. There's something about the thing that you just, you want to be [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6000.24s)]
*  able to be a guy. And I think when it gets confusing as to what does that even mean, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6007.679999999999s)]
*  where are you allowed to be? What are you allowed to do? Yeah. And then also like all the sex toys [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6012.24s)]
*  came out and you're like, well, we can't even, what are we doing? You know what I'm saying? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6019.44s)]
*  My nuts are powered by a battery powered by the Lord or whatever. I can't compete with these [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6028.16s)]
*  ingenuity or whatever. It's not the same as having an intimate relationship. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6036.48s)]
*  No, but it's also threatening, you know, when it's like, you know, you hear some of the other [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6040.72s)]
*  room and it just sounds like it should have a fan belt on it. It's like some of these, it's just [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6046.16s)]
*  into, I don't know. I think that's kind of, you know, I don't know what I'm talking about, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6050.240000000001s)]
*  but I don't think we should end on this note. I'm pretty lonely as well. What's something you feel [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6054.320000000001s)]
*  like, before you leave that you would like to share with us or something else we can think about? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6058.56s)]
*  Well, the main thing I would really love people to know, which is an umbrella over everything that [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6065.84s)]
*  we've talked about today. And like you've said, there's so much more we could talk about is that [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6071.6s)]
*  you have so much potential in your brain. Your brain is amazing. And if you know how to use it [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6075.76s)]
*  properly, you can make your life so much better than you ever dreamed it could be. Really? Yes. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6081.04s)]
*  Wow. How does somebody who doesn't believe that start to believe it? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6087.76s)]
*  Um, I would make a set of tweaks in some very basic fundamental areas and I would make them [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6092.32s)]
*  micro tweaks. So where I talk about sleep, diet, hydration, exercise and stress management, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6102.32s)]
*  I always say change 10 things by 1%, not one thing by 10%. So if you went to bed half an hour [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6110.96s)]
*  earlier, or you drank an extra glass of water every day, or you ate some more vegetables, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6117.12s)]
*  and you, you know, walked a thousand steps more than you usually do, and spent some time in nature, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6122.08s)]
*  and we haven't even talked about neuroesthetics, which is a whole other topic. Yeah. Then if you [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6129.28s)]
*  do a few things like that every day, they're physical things that are building the foundation [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6134.16s)]
*  for your brain to be in a good environment where it can be better. You will, I guarantee you feel [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6138.400000000001s)]
*  so much better within a matter of weeks that you'll think, okay, what else can I do? Yeah. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6144.24s)]
*  And then you can build it up to a point where physically you're in really good condition. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6148.8s)]
*  And then you could do a vision board or, you know, whatever your goal is. Maybe for part two, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6154.32s)]
*  we could ask people to write in and say, this is what I'd like to achieve. How could I do it? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6159.76s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be cool. Yeah. You know, one thing you said it is it's so easy to create a pattern. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6165.04s)]
*  It feels hard. The first day is a little tough. The second day is a little bit tougher, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6170.16s)]
*  but then that third day you're like, holy shit, this is a pattern. And it feels different and it [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6174.639999999999s)]
*  feels cool. And then you get excited about it. And there's nothing bigger I've learned in my life [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6180.5599999999995s)]
*  to our than, um, get like realizing if you do this and then you do that and then you're like, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6185.5199999999995s)]
*  oh, now the landscape looks different. Now what else could I do? What else could I do? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6194.48s)]
*  You're a classic example of that. I just can't sometimes I'm like, what else can I do? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6198.8s)]
*  What else? Like, holy shit, the world's like, I could do some, what else to what else could I do? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6203.2s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. But man, it really is especially. Yeah. There were times when I [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6209.360000000001s)]
*  just didn't feel like I could do, you know, and yeah. Also for you, there are millions of people [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6214.56s)]
*  that some of them you might know about. Some of you will never know about the influence that you've [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6221.360000000001s)]
*  had on them. And that's another thing that you're doing passively by doing everything that you do, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6225.6s)]
*  which is huge. Yeah. Yeah. We don't know the effects that we're going to have on other people [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6229.76s)]
*  and stuff like that. It's pretty magical. That's why we need each other. You know, we need each [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6234.4800000000005s)]
*  other to build our oxytocin up. Huh? Do we got to get more oxytocin going on? Well laughter creates [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6237.92s)]
*  it. So you're, you're spreading oxytocin like crazy. And is it, do we have synthetic oxytocin [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6244.240000000001s)]
*  or they don't have that? I don't know if I even want to get you to Google this, but you can [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6250.4s)]
*  actually purchase it over the internet. You obviously do not know what you are getting, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6256.4s)]
*  so please be careful. In lab experiments, they used a nasal spray of oxytocin and they showed [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6259.92s)]
*  guys pictures of women that they had to rate them on attractiveness before and after taking the spray. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6266.96s)]
*  They rated them all as more attractive after taking the spray. Yeah. Yeah, dude. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6273.839999999999s)]
*  I looked up oxytocin and nose spray was the top search. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6280.0s)]
*  So there's an oxytocin nose spray. Don't get crazy guys, but maybe I'll take a hit of it. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6283.92s)]
*  Next time we do the, uh, next time we record what you and I, I'll take at least a hit. Yeah. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6289.2s)]
*  I don't think you need to. That's quite insulting to me. Oh, sorry. I'll let you take a hit. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6294.72s)]
*  You're going to need it. Yeah. If you look at me, you're going to need some oxytocin, man. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6300.32s)]
*  Or we can give a little to a pup or something. Yeah. Um, and see what he can do that experiment. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6306.56s)]
*  Give some to a puppy and see what happens. Is that legal? Uh, I don't know. I'm sure some [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6311.6s)]
*  people write in the comments if it is or not. Um, Tara Swart, thank you so much. Your book, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6318.0s)]
*  the source. I haven't read it, uh, but I would like to, you know, so I'm gonna keep it on my [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6323.04s)]
*  list of stuff to read at some point. And, um, yeah, thank you for just being somebody that wants to [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6328.4800000000005s)]
*  help share like the information that you have and are learning. Like you're really on the [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6333.12s)]
*  forefront of things that are possible for the future. You know, neuroscience is crazy, you know, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6336.96s)]
*  cause we just don't know what our brain is capable of. Do you, what percentage of information about [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6340.5599999999995s)]
*  our brains do you think we currently know? Well, that's a really good question. It's hard to put a [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6345.76s)]
*  percentage on it, but if I think about how much has changed since I was at medical school, and if, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6350.4s)]
*  if I align that with the fact that what we used to watch as science fiction as kids, like a lot of [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6356.0s)]
*  it's true now, I just don't think we know how much potential there is. I think it's big. You know, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6360.16s)]
*  all I can say is it's bigger than what we think. We're not capable of knowing that yet. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6365.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. Cause we're not even capable of knowing it yet. That's the wildest [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6369.76s)]
*  thing, man. Is we're not even capable. Like again, you got to get there. Sometimes you got to get [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6375.12s)]
*  that next place to see what else is even possible. Yeah. And now with AI and everything, it's, you [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6380.72s)]
*  know, it's just changed the whole. Who knows? Yeah. I mean, we could both be, yeah, who even [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6385.12s)]
*  knows? We couldn't be living in an orphanage right now or something, or who knows AI can do so many [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6391.44s)]
*  things. So, um, Dr. Tara Swart, thank you so much for coming. Uh, yeah. I look forward to catching [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6395.5199999999995s)]
*  up with you too. And I'm in your country. I'd love that. Yep. And, um, your book, the source, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6401.84s)]
*  uh, are you still teaching at MIT? Yeah. Wow. That's crazy, dude. That's like really MIT, dude. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6406.72s)]
*  You're like, Oh yeah. That was something I manifested that I never thought. Really? Yeah. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6414.08s)]
*  And that's crazy. Cause I don't even know where it is. You hear about it a lot. You're like, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6420.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, they're doing something illegal. It feels like, but probably pretty good. Yeah. Um, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6423.68s)]
*  thank you so much for coming. Thank you. And thank you for my wonderful gift as well. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6430.0s)]
*  Very sweet of you, love. I'm going to have a little bit of this when I'm feeling a bit down, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6434.0s)]
*  mom. Yeah. Good on you, miss. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHV77XRgLr4&t=6438.72s)]
