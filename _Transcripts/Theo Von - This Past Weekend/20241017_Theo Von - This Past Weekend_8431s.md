*  Yes, I want to learn all about [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=86.72s)]
*  Acro cats and I want to learn all about the traveling [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=89.72s)]
*  Cat universe and everything that there is to know about it because it really is just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=93.08s)]
*  Fascinating to think about them cats and and everything that they're doing and and just how involved with it you are, you know [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=97.2s)]
*  Just to start I guess what are some like what is a cat? I guess basically [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=105.72s)]
*  How would you even what is like a cat? I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess I guess [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=109.12s)]
*  How would you even what is like a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=115.12s)]
*  Like I mean, I know it's kind of an easy question [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=117.48s)]
*  But what do you some people probably don't aren't even that aren't big pets like connoisseurs or whatever [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=119.28s)]
*  How do you put that in? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  Is there a certain size of it or like how tall is a cat I tell oh boy that's you're open with a question [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=128.56s)]
*  I don't even know the answer to they're very they've got really varying size [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=134.76s)]
*  Some the some of the cats are more petite. We do a lot of bottle babies [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=138.6s)]
*  So they tend to be a little bit on the smaller side females a little bit on the smaller side [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=142.74s)]
*  But the cats are really kind of misunderstood [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=147.78s)]
*  Everybody thinks that cats are aloof and that they they can't be trained that they don't really need [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  Socialization or kind of the same kind of things that the dogs need a lot of people get cats [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=157.3s)]
*  You're thinking that's not gonna be any work at all [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  I just have to scoop a litter box or get an auto [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  Scooping litter box and throw out some food and be done with it or you know [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=167.02s)]
*  Dog is so much more work, but in actuality a cat is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=170.86s)]
*  Is just as much work as a dog and people should invest that time because cats are brilliant people don't realize just how brilliant [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=175.34s)]
*  Cats are yeah. Oh, yeah, I've seen some cats. They have all types of cats [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they even had one cat went to space I think even I [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  Know a cat went down Niagara Falls [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=192.5s)]
*  Really you know a cat that went to Niagara Falls went down Niagara Falls went down the first person that survived [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=194.58s)]
*  The barrel trip down the falls she took a cat with no way for good luck or just for just who knows [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=200.3s)]
*  I mean I did wasn't around during that time to ask her afterwards [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=207.02s)]
*  I mean what made you bring a cat down the falls with you, but she and the cat survived Wow yeah [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=210.3s)]
*  Okay, so a cat like and a cat can be you said almost any size. Oh, yeah [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=217.22s)]
*  I mean there's huge cats there's Maine Coon cats that are giant [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=222.46s)]
*  Our cats are a little bit on that they're all none of our cats are pure but breadcats because they're all [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=225.66s)]
*  Rescue cats so they but the main Coon cats are giant. I mean I've seen [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=231.02s)]
*  Like they're almost dog size [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=236.86s)]
*  Oh wow so and then there's the real small ones that the munchkins and they have those short legs and that they and that you know [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=238.86s)]
*  It's not really good to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=246.06s)]
*  breed for certain thing you know it just seems uncomfortable for some of the cats to yeah to have like short legs and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=247.5s)]
*  Difficulty for them to get around but yeah, they come in all different sizes and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=254.10000000000002s)]
*  Shapes and large ears small ears some cats are hairless some cats are oh [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=257.82s)]
*  You know furry just so a cat can basically be almost any [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=262.22s)]
*  Like how tall are the cats you work with because the cats I've seen are probably a lot of them are about this tall [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=267.58s)]
*  Probably well, I guess that's if they're just sitting up if they're walking yeah [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=272.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's I mean it's kind of there's a typical cat size [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=276.14s)]
*  But the main Coons are the ones that are the giant oh a main Coon yeah the main Coons are the giant ones [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=279.7s)]

*  Rescue cats okay. No purebreds. Oh really so you guys so acro cats is a lot of rescues then oh yes [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=344.46s)]

*  You know that movie [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=360.62s)]
*  Yes, it's been a long time yeah, so I kind of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=362.62s)]
*  Really remember the premise yeah, I think it was just some of the some of more kind of like [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=366.74s)]
*  Yes, some of the kids were kind of like having a tough time. You know it was like those type of kids [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=372.26s)]
*  So how did you get started with acro cats and what is acro cats first of all so? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=378.14s)]
*  The amazing acro cats they're a troop of former orphan rescues and strays that have come into my life over the years [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=384.42s)]
*  And I've trained them to do awesome things to show people that not only can cats be trained [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=390.78s)]
*  But they should be trained so well they travel around the country we we now tour in a large bus [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  We initially started out in a small little ambulance, and then slowly built up to this giant [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=401.9s)]
*  Money pit of a bus yeah Boston is expensive. Oh so expensive [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  So you guys were in an ambulance at one point I started things I started my career [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=412.46s)]
*  With an ambulance back in the days when I was you know doing rats and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=417.85999999999996s)]
*  Wildlife education and all of that so I've been I've been working with animals since I was 10 [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=423.29999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so you've been working with animals since you was a child really you was really? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=427.62s)]
*  Just a child animal worker, and they [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=432.73999999999995s)]
*  And so you get started you said with rats first [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=435.58s)]
*  I knew I wanted to be an animal trainer since I was 7 okay [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=438.62s)]
*  So you knew out of the gate you wanted to be out there with them animals yes [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=442.0s)]
*  And how did you know you'd be at a zoo or something would flare up in you when you would see an animal or how [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=445.22s)]
*  Do you know that you loved them well? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=449.62s)]
*  My parents did like a letter every year like those annoying Christmas letters that people send out detailing their whole their whole year [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=451.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like patty got her menstrual cycle or whatever yeah, Danny's playing volleyball [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=459.5s)]
*  Yeah, so my parents did one every year. Yeah, we got those in our neighborhood some of them were too much like oh [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=465.5s)]
*  One year they sent it was like Ron left us if anybody's seen or whatever call us and we're like this is for [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=472.58000000000004s)]
*  Christmas like it was just but some of them got a little invasive, but um okay, sorry I interrupted you [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=479.3s)]
*  Oh, no, yeah, but but so looking back through all those those Christmas letters I [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=484.18s)]
*  It talked about how I talked about wanting a cat wanting a cat as soon as I was able to talk [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=489.06s)]
*  I wanted a cat and then I found a book [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=494.02000000000004s)]
*  That was like a book about me that I had filled out when I was seven and it said when I grow up [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=496.94s)]
*  I want to be and I put on I put I filled an animal trainer or Indian. Oh, that's good [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=501.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's kind of the same thing almost because the Indians were so close to nature really you know yeah [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=507.62s)]
*  Yeah, really is kind of similar path. I guess spiritual connection with animals [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=513.66s)]
*  Yeah, so you wanted to be really dialed in out of the gate [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=518.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I knew what I wanted to do right from the get-go my parents. They had a different plan for me [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=521.56s)]
*  What did they think they wanted? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=527.28s)]
*  They wanted the traditional I mean they sent me to college to get my MRS [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=528.5s)]

*  The natural history of chickens he hired me again for for that to train the chickens [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=772.98s)]
*  And I didn't know anything about chickens when I took that job. Oh yeah, oh good. Yeah, it was I mean back then the internet [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=777.0600000000001s)]
*  There was just some Yahoo groups, and and I saw I mean and he was a tough guy to work for too [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=782.88s)]
*  I mean he if you did you did things did not go right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=788.24s)]
*  I mean he would just be yeah yell at you like two inches from your face [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=791.72s)]
*  I mean just he was intense. Oh, he was so intense [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  And I mean I saw there were nights when I worked on the rat film it I cried every night [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=798.88s)]
*  But it was you know he was so good. I mean he really knew what he wanted [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=803.6s)]
*  I'm like damn it get these rats to do it or whatever [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=807.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was just he was very hardcore just and you know very few people survived working for a man a Mark Lewis film [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=809.7800000000001s)]
*  But his his film was what you know won awards so [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=817.1400000000001s)]
*  When he asked me back to do the chicken I didn't get yelled at you know the entire shoot [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=820.82s)]
*  I mean I nobody could have a conversation with me during the chicken training part portion because I was learning about chickens [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=826.22s)]
*  There are so many things that could go wrong with this chicken training thing. I'm sure yeah even just the term chicken training. Yeah [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=831.84s)]
*  Sounds like it's not gonna work out. Oh, yeah, I had to get I had to have a white silky hen [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=839.7s)]
*  Go broody, which means they lay would they lay on eggs right so and then once the chicken once [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=844.9000000000001s)]
*  I found a chicken actually laid eggs because this broodiness has been bred out of them over the years because most people want them for food [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=851.0200000000001s)]
*  Or just yeah, oh, yeah, they don't want them to lay on them [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=857.1s)]
*  So I had all these white silky chickens found one that laid eggs and sat on them [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=861.62s)]
*  So then I had to take the eggs and put replace them with golf balls keep the eggs safe then transport that chicken to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=866.64s)]
*  Somewhere in the south it was I was somewhere in the get out in the country with these check [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=876.6s)]
*  We were working on these chicken with these chickens [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=881.86s)]
*  So I got to get them on the flight get them to the location and then put the eggs in an incubator and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=883.76s)]
*  On the exact day that he needed to shoot these chickens hatching they had to hatch [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=890.0s)]
*  So it there's so many things that could have gone wrong. Yeah [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=895.72s)]
*  We were playing God at that point. Oh, yeah [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=899.9599999999999s)]
*  It was so still so stressful. I had to train a rooster to crow on coming on cue [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=902.8399999999999s)]
*  So and I had no I I mean I was really you know, I was I was self-taught [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=909.16s)]
*  This is pre internet. This is before you could look up all the things and just find answers [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=913.18s)]
*  I mean, I was in what do you do you don't do you tickle him or whatever? What do you do to get a rooster to? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=917.86s)]
*  Do it well you would find [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=923.26s)]
*  You you find out what make them would make them crow naturally [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=925.58s)]
*  So they actually they kind of trained me so I'd have a rooster in the downstairs with a baby monitor [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=929.26s)]
*  So I'd be upstairs and anytime I heard that rooster crow. I'd go running downstairs and then I wave an American flag and [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=936.1800000000001s)]
*  Click and treat and give the you know, because I knew about clicker training at that point [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=944.0200000000001s)]
*  So I would click and treat and give the rooster, you know a reward for for crowing [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=947.56s)]
*  So I also but I also knew that I needed to put it on a cue so that it couldn't just we couldn't be waiting [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=952.8s)]
*  Around for it to crow. I needed to signal right for it to crow [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=958.16s)]
*  So that's what the flag was for I would be like I'm waving the flag. It's still crowing. I'm waving the flag [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=961.18s)]
*  I'm clicking and treating and not really knowing what I'm doing. Just hoping it's gonna work create a pattern. Yeah. Yes [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=965.5s)]
*  Yes, and I you know, and people would be trying to talk to me and I'd be like [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=971.04s)]
*  What if I taught the chicken to follow a ribbon and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=975.36s)]
*  We could put that ribbon on the camera and then the chicken would follow that [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=979.72s)]
*  Camera everywhere because we need those camera like right now right in the camera shots [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=982.84s)]
*  I mean nobody could talk to me about anything because I was so hyper focused on making these chickens perfect for this [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=986.76s)]
*  For this no and I mean it it was turned out beautifully [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't believe how how I all my hard work paid off Wow. Yeah, so it's but I [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  Was pretty remarkable. Yeah, I mean it really considering I didn't really know anything about chickens when I took the job. Yeah [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1003.6s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems like an insane job to take and do oh, yeah [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1010.88s)]
*  Yeah, and then to pull it off. Yes and to pull it off and not get screamed at once. Yeah tire shoot [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1015.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was that was amazing. Well, so you got the rooster crowing you got you you're working with the chickens [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1021.28s)]

*  You know having to go to the library and creating these cage carts so that I can when people came in [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1173.0s)]
*  I could I could educate them on like, okay, you're interested in buying this particular lizard [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1177.3200000000002s)]

*  But he was just a monster. Yeah, and at that point I had my little rat show trained up [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1194.74s)]
*  Oh, you got the rats you get performing now. Yeah, they're performing in nightclubs and things like that. Okay now so that sounds [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1199.42s)]

*  Something that's important. The rats are performing in nightclubs with you as the trainer. They're not okay [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1210.54s)]

*  They jump through hoops [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1230.52s)]
*  They'd even bull and I the best trick was they would run they they drive up into in an ambulance [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1231.32s)]
*  And then they would go up a fire truck into a burning little [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1237.4s)]
*  Kids house with the fake flames of course and there'd be a doll in the in the house [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1241.8s)]
*  So that the rats would go up the ladder rescue the doll come back down and put it into the ambulance [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1246.76s)]
*  No way [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=1252.32s)]

*  with the cats, okay and [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2932.26s)]

*  So it just wiped us out financially and [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2945.54s)]
*  Just as we were trying to explore the options of trying to bring justice to what has happened [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2950.2999999999997s)]
*  kovat hits so [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2956.8599999999997s)]

*  without being able to tour when we finally got it back and then we had to undo all the damage that this guy had done because [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2967.3799999999997s)]
*  He was supposed to be converting another bus first because he said this bus is no good. It's dangerous to drive [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2973.04s)]
*  We'll get it. We'll get find a shell of a bus and then I'll transfer everything over to the you know, that's usable [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2978.0s)]
*  They lie. He was like all it was all alive all lie in the meantime. He was just retrofitting [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2984.46s)]
*  The my bus that was actually perfectly fine [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2990.32s)]
*  There's the issues with it, but it was not a death trap like he said it was yeah [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2993.1600000000003s)]
*  He stripped the wrap off of it because it was a gourd, you know covered with cats [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=2997.12s)]
*  It was gorgeous rap strip the rap off of it [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3000.56s)]

*  I mean he just I guess he was gonna flip it and and I don't know how I don't know how his endgame was gonna [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3011.32s)]
*  Work cuz I still had the title [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3017.56s)]
*  I mean, I just paid the thing off and we'd raised it. It's not like it's not like I bought [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3018.96s)]
*  We ran we got it through a Kickstarter. So the fans donated money to get this bus [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3024.36s)]
*  It's not like I can go out by another bus and what why did he do this so much? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3028.54s)]
*  Did you was he just a driver he was he was kind of a pathological liar [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3032.06s)]
*  And he was young which made it which made prosecution really difficult because he [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3038.34s)]
*  Small town is the sheriff a family has a share in the pocket. What do you mean? Ricky did that? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3044.86s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like he said she said kind of thing [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3051.14s)]
*  And I mean that sheriff just questioned me like I was the bad one and and [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3053.9s)]
*  Pretty much what the heat because he doesn't have assets and no [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3059.58s)]
*  Yeah, the Lord there it's like I mean, it's not about the money. It's about justice. He committed a felony, you know [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3063.82s)]
*  What a piece of shit. I mean he just decimated it me to my core [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3069.98s)]
*  I mean, I'll never I mean I had I had dreams of doing so much more as far as like good work [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3074.58s)]
*  I mean I could be one of I could have been one of those people out in crisis situations like Katrina [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3080.62s)]
*  rescuing animals because we were in a really good place at that point before the [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3085.74s)]
*  Before the scam happened and you know that setback and then we've just had to put more so much money into the bus to get [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3091.38s)]
*  It back to its original shape and then everything's dry rot having to sit for so long while kovat was going on because I couldn't travel [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3097.86s)]
*  And it's it's we're still sinking right now [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3106.5s)]
*  it's it's sitting in a shop in Iowa and [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3109.46s)]
*  They were supposed to be fixing this light out and they're like they decided well [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3111.82s)]
*  We're not gonna be able to get to it [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3115.6600000000003s)]
*  It's you know, we thought it was gonna be this that this would fix it, but it didn't and now [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3117.3s)]
*  We're we have other jobs that are more important than you [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3122.7400000000002s)]
*  So we basically get the bus back and it's not fixed and it's all Iowa is the only place that can fix this issue [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3125.46s)]
*  So once again, yeah, it just [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3133.26s)]
*  Just hit hit hit again hit hard with nothing with nothing with it not being repaired [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3136.46s)]
*  I'm having to spend you know, this money bad luck and bad actors. Yeah [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3141.54s)]
*  Yeah, bad people and just are not being helpful and it's especially you know as a female too [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3146.62s)]
*  It's a struggle to get you know, I respect as a oh, you need to get things done as a woman [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3153.1800000000003s)]
*  I [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3159.02s)]
*  Resort to having a guy make that call. Yeah, because I can't get anything done. Yeah, so it's unfortunate [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3159.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry that that happens. Yeah, it was so it was [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3165.1s)]
*  definitely rough times and we're just finally bouncing back getting you know getting things rolling again and [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3169.26s)]
*  And it's just hard to find help post Cobra. Nobody wants to work. Yeah, but he wants to travel [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3176.1s)]
*  It's hard to find a you know girls that whose boyfriends will let him go on the road. It's bizarre [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3180.9s)]
*  You know that double standard guys can tour girls can't yeah [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3185.98s)]
*  Yeah, and we need more women out there entertaining everybody. It's important [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3189.82s)]
*  So how do we get from rats to cats take me some of that journey? So so I was you know [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3194.42s)]
*  The rats I had to I do I realized I couldn't make a living on just rats [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3200.42s)]
*  So I became the rat company and friends and then I ended up changing a name to amazing animals [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3204.7400000000002s)]
*  And I was doing the wildlife shows [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3211.34s)]
*  Doing and without a traveling show as well. No, no, it was well it was kind of traveling [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3213.2599999999998s)]
*  But it was going to school schools and stuff like that, but it wasn't like the tour wasn't touring yet [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3218.18s)]
*  So I I fell in love with touring like way like way later on and that's kind of when the cats came into play [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3222.62s)]
*  Okay, so I was doing the wildlife shows and libraries and schools educating kids [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3229.14s)]
*  But my really you know my heart and soul was I wanted to still wanted to train animals for film and television [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3233.98s)]
*  So I realized I wanted to show animals you wanted yeah [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3238.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3241.72s)]
*  I just was like get always what I wanted to do is I see my you know and and see my cats in a commercial or [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3242.3999999999996s)]
*  See my animals in a commercial. So there's you know, there's a you know, there's not so much rat work out there [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3248.52s)]
*  It's not a whole lot. So I thought well, maybe I should you know, there's a lot of dog trainers out there [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3253.8799999999997s)]
*  The rats, you know have kind of met their limit, you know, let's revisit the cat [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3258.9599999999996s)]
*  I know we had that one experience where there was I was like, it's got to be a way to work these cats [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3263.2s)]
*  So you still want to do animals for film and television and you decide you're gonna give cats another shot [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3268.64s)]
*  Yeah, let's give cats another shot. I always loved always loved cats, but I know they're they are difficult to work with it is a it is [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3274.6s)]
*  they're they're [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3281.0s)]
*  You know, they're small so they there's a lot of predators out there [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3283.8399999999997s)]
*  So they're a little bit like what could get me what could get me? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3287.6s)]
*  So, you know, I mean I didn't have no idea [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3290.6s)]
*  You know, I had no idea like I needed to figure out how to [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3293.7999999999997s)]
*  Make this work and I so I thought what if I did what I did all those years ago with the like with like with [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3298.56s)]
*  The rats and try that with the cats put a little show together and start taking it around to like low-key [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3304.8799999999997s)]
*  No pressure not charging money just passing the hat art. It started in art galleries. So I [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3311.44s)]
*  Basically like I'm gonna let the cats teach me how to teach them [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3317.7999999999997s)]
*  So, okay. And so do you set up something kind of at home? Do you audition some cats? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3323.0s)]
*  Like how do you so I had this cat tuna had to come into my life. That was brilliant [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3328.08s)]
*  I mean she was very focused wanted to learn I had learned clicker training a lot more about clicker training at this point [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3332.7599999999998s)]
*  So I was it actually started with tuna tuna was the inspiration behind the whole thing [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3339.64s)]
*  I was taking her to pet expos just kind of showing off what she could do [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3344.7999999999997s)]
*  You know and have a ring a bell and tap a tip jar at a rescue table and then I donate you know [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3348.8799999999997s)]
*  Donate whatever she got into the rescue and so I was just taking her everywhere [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3354.2799999999997s)]
*  I was taking her to the film festivals and having her play a guitar ring a bell and do some things trying to get her [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3357.8399999999997s)]
*  some work there and I thought well, let's you know, try putting a show together and [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3364.0s)]
*  So I found an art gallery that was looking for some kind of entertainment [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3370.12s)]
*  And I the band I had put together already at that point and that was pretty solid the band [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3375.36s)]
*  What do you mean the the Rock cats? So we had the we had a guitar drums [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3380.2799999999997s)]
*  And piano and these are cats performing. Yeah, so okay [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3386.12s)]
*  I had actually came first and what cats were in a tunas in it tuna tuna played the cowbell, but that came later [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3389.16s)]
*  Okay, so she was the donation collector for the band. Okay, so she's really yes [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3394.88s)]
*  She's out there in the box. Yeah, she's the one you know, like hey [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3401.0s)]
*  Better put some money in this tip jar. Yeah [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3404.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you gotta have that and the band had a had a curtain said the Rock cats [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3406.54s)]
*  They had their own table and their instruments had their scent on it [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3411.3s)]
*  So so they the cat the band the cat band seemed to work now the rest of the act [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3413.98s)]
*  I mean I went to Home Depot [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3419.06s)]
*  I got a couple ladders and big rope and then you know some I tied weights to the [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3420.98s)]
*  Ladders to keep them from folding in and I found some some stools at IKEA [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3425.82s)]
*  My initial setup was very crude just whatever could you know a lot of like dog agility props small dog agility props, so [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3429.94s)]
*  So then I find an art gallery. I'd set everything up and the cats I mean it was just [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3438.3s)]
*  The cats would come out they they'd like look around and stretch groom a little bit and and you know [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3443.94s)]
*  It's kind of a just a utter fail. I mean, there's a lot of a lot of fails [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3451.26s)]
*  They wouldn't show they wouldn't perform stage fright or was it [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3455.54s)]
*  Do they hate they didn't this is all this is new to them. This is new to me [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3459.58s)]
*  Yeah, they don't even know that they're a show cat yet. Yeah, so so I'm like trying to figure out [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3463.48s)]
*  Okay, what what do you need to make make you comfortable? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3469.1s)]
*  So I said so I started bringing my own floor like a rollout floor [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3472.52s)]
*  So I brought a floor that had their scent on it and I realized that they're always doing this like, okay [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3475.42s)]
*  I go okay [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3480.18s)]
*  They don't like they don't like knowing what's not what you know, what is behind them they need to know what's behind them [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3480.9s)]
*  So then I put up a backdrop behind them. So now they have a solid back wall behind them [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3487.38s)]
*  They have a floor that they're familiar with the scent and I've been working them at home and now I'm bringing them into this new [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3491.6800000000003s)]
*  Environment tuna is pretty solid. She'll do her tricks. She'll ring her bell. She'll do the various thing the other cat [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3499.54s)]
*  You go to you know, she's the go-to now the other cats are a little bit, you know hesitant [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3504.78s)]
*  They're a little slow and but they're doing it but they're doing it but they're doing it at their own pace. So [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3509.2s)]
*  So then I would just have to come up with funny things to say [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3515.9199999999996s)]
*  While that while we're waiting for the cats to maybe do something or maybe not do something [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3519.08s)]
*  And so you had to be the performer at that point. Oh, yeah [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3523.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean I've consistently had to be the performer because those cats are mixing it up every show [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3526.7999999999997s)]
*  I never know what's gonna happen or not happen [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3530.46s)]
*  and [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3532.64s)]
*  because it's I have a [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3533.72s)]
*  Because they're damn well also because I have a personal relationship with the cats are not just kennels with [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3535.3199999999997s)]
*  Where they just come out during training and then back to the kennels? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3543.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean I watch television with these cats I sleep with these cats, you know, it's been I take them on road trips [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3546.6s)]
*  You know where so cats with someone's sleep in your bed. Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3551.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, especially if it's a little cold, you know pile on more cats. I mean, yeah [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3555.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3560.02s)]
*  Unlimited yeah. Yeah exactly. They purr is so comforting. I mean just I love I love them [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3561.22s)]
*  So they're my babies. I've raised some of them from two days old, you know bottle feed [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3566.46s)]
*  you know, so, you know saved hundreds of kittens with bottle feeding because that's like one of my turned out to be one of my [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3570.7400000000002s)]
*  superpowers is to be able to to [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3576.7400000000002s)]
*  save little babies and [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3579.26s)]
*  So like little by little the cats taught me what they needed to feel comfortable [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3581.62s)]
*  you know on stage and the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3586.66s)]
*  Started to like, you know the applause [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3589.98s)]
*  There's something called like a secondary and reinforces. So there's a primary reinforcer, which is the food click equals treat [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3593.06s)]
*  You hear the click they get a treat, right? So then the applause [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3598.7400000000002s)]
*  Actually starts to end laughter also becomes a secondary reinforcer. So they're like, oh if we hear applause or laughter [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3604.38s)]
*  we're also that means we're doing good we're going to get a treat and [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3612.62s)]
*  The so of course they'll take advantage of and do things just to get that laughter which [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3617.26s)]
*  Which ends up kind of paying off in the show because people just find it hysterical as cat comes out doesn't sometimes they just leave the stage and [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3623.1400000000003s)]
*  Sit out in the crowd the whole time come back sit on us [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3631.5400000000004s)]
*  It's like a Kodak black or something [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3634.42s)]
*  Yeah [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3636.78s)]
*  they decide what they want to do when they want to do it if they want to do it and [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3637.26s)]
*  I just kind of follow helplessly along and come up with some witty banner to cover their their slowness and their fail moments and [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3641.3s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like my story as well and how each of these cats came into my life [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3648.34s)]
*  Their story how they came in, you know how they came to be what their special skills are what just you know [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3652.34s)]
*  I see so a lot of it is not as much there's there's there's certainly some training of the actual cats [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3658.48s)]
*  yes, but there's also you training yourself just to [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3665.1800000000003s)]
*  Understand that these are cats and I need to [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3669.6200000000003s)]
*  Try and just make it as comfortable environment for them to be here and then I need to train myself how to react if they don't [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3674.98s)]
*  react [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3682.46s)]
*  Or how to react to whatever they're doing. Yeah, and and they're all interesting [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3683.82s)]
*  So they it's almost like improv. Oh, it is improv. It's so improv [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3688.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3692.34s)]
*  so and they come out we have carriers that they're in and [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3692.6200000000003s)]
*  When they come out of their carrier there the doors are of the carriers are open the carriers are there's our safe place for them [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3695.3s)]
*  it's it's like like a [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3700.92s)]
*  Portable it's like a green room. Yeah. Yeah, so, you know like that [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3703.98s)]
*  No, that's that's a safe place all of my cats are whistle-train to go to a carrier [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3707.2200000000003s)]
*  Which is great for emergency situations if you need to call your cats quickly and get them out of the house because if there's a there's a [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3711.54s)]
*  Fire or some disaster. Oh, yeah, you can blow a whistle and the cats come running they go in the carriers [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3717.64s)]
*  They're used to traveling [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3722.3s)]
*  So if they're not feeling it or they're having an uncomfortable moment and they're not liking the person in the front row that has big hair [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3723.1800000000003s)]
*  Which I'm always picking up on I'm always watching the cats. I'm watching the audience [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3730.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm watching like just constantly reading and communicating with these cats while doing the show and [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3734.5400000000004s)]
*  What and making mental notes about okay, you know, wiki does not like people with big hair and the front row [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3741.38s)]
*  They do not like wheels rolling by that's that you know, that's babies crying everything stops when the babies cry [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3747.86s)]
*  There's a lot of challenges, but if they don't feel like coming up they have a moment [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3756.38s)]
*  They're like I need to I'm gonna I'm gonna go back to the carrier. They can do that [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3760.56s)]
*  So they're they that is their safe. That's their safe, you know, it's like a portable base camp for them [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3763.92s)]
*  So when I when I take them out for like outings or camping, you know [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3768.78s)]
*  I have a harness on them and then I also have a backpack [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3772.42s)]
*  Camping is that part of the show? Is that no, that's just for fun. Okay, you guys will go camping [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3776.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because when I when I'm raising new kittens and to to you know, you know [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3780.34s)]
*  Yeah to adopt out or to be in the show, you know [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3785.82s)]
*  I want to bomb proof them so that they're comfortable in any atmosphere because the way the world is today [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3789.34s)]
*  The disaster could be around any corner [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3795.82s)]
*  Yeah, and these cats need to be able to be comfortable being transferred to other areas and you know loud noises [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3797.92s)]
*  So I was you know, I have clicker and so clicker interest anytime there they're freaked out by something [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3804.98s)]
*  Especially there's a window of time with kittens where they they adapt really quickly like they may hear thunder and be like [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3809.82s)]
*  Right, and then I click and treat during that moment and I turn that bad [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3817.42s)]
*  Experience into a good experience now [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3822.26s)]
*  Next time at thunders. They're like, oh, well, that's nothing at and where my treat [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3825.1400000000003s)]
*  So even fireworks and such I mean I click and treat during my cats are not bothered by fireworks because they've all [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3830.42s)]
*  Been I've all I've can you know whenever fireworks have been around I had the clicker and the treats out and click and treat and click [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3837.3s)]
*  And treat so anything that that they found distressing and I and I've learned more and more over the years since I've been doing this [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=3843.46s)]

*  The animal kingdom and the human kingdom oh yeah, you got a lot of the work ethic is disappearing [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4409.74s)]
*  How did the touring start so I had just come back from a [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4416.62s)]
*  Thing called a festival of cultures where I was doing a wildlife program, but it was touring [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4421.9400000000005s)]
*  So we were touring with five other groups there Polynesian Paradise Africa the [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4427.62s)]
*  European where they did sword fighting and [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4434.06s)]
*  Are these all animal shows or different variety shows so they were they were [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4436.5s)]
*  There was an educational tour, so they basically were educating people about the [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4440.38s)]
*  They're this culture got it so the and some of it was more fun [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4446.26s)]
*  You know like Europe Europe they did sword fighting and that Native America was that was a little bit more educational [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4450.8s)]
*  And then I represented wildlife of the world so I my little segment would be bringing out various [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4456.78s)]
*  animals and doing my wildlife presentation to you know teach people like you know these various animals from these parts of the [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4462.5s)]
*  World and that's when I fell in love with touring [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4469.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's when I was right dry and traveling in an ambulance at that you know initially [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4472.139999999999s)]

*  Knew that maybe I could do something with these cats and when I got back and I knew that wildlife [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4513.94s)]
*  They weren't gonna be including us in the next round of tours and at this point [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4518.22s)]

*  Well, there's two two thousand nine is kind of when things really shifted shifted from you know [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4705.299999999999s)]

*  But then 2009 is when things shifted because I I wanted to add another cat to the show [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4759.5s)]

*  Pick one and be a what if it's not like the right one and I can't just return it cuz well, this one's dumb [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4805.46s)]
*  You know that so I thought well, why don't I foster a litter and then I'll train them all pick the best one and then [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4811.0199999999995s)]
*  Find the rest of them home. So that was my plan and then I found a [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4817.5s)]
*  Rescue that you know were desperate for foster. So [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4823.0199999999995s)]
*  so they snatched me up immediately because there was a dire need for for fosters and [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4826.54s)]
*  And they sent me into the trenches. I mean I had no no knowledge [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4832.0599999999995s)]
*  No, it's not I didn't have no idea what I was getting into so they send me to a [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4836.14s)]
*  Rescue shelter that's basically an intake facility not open to the public people dump off animals there [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4842.660000000001s)]
*  They take send me the kitten room and they say [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4849.14s)]
*  So whoever you don't whoever you don't pick from this room today. We're gonna be euthanized [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4852.540000000001s)]
*  12 kittens in that room. This is a Japanese game show [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4857.700000000001s)]
*  But no that could be a Japanese game [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4866.02s)]
*  Probably probably is a Japanese game show actually was with squid game out there what not I could see that [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4869.9400000000005s)]
*  You walk into a room [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4876.9800000000005s)]
*  Wherever you don't pick we're gonna be used tonight. I'm like what? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4879.660000000001s)]
*  You left out of there that day with how many 12 kittens I take them home they have [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4886.18s)]
*  Sorry, I mean to make that sound if they all have respiratory issues [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4890.94s)]
*  I didn't know all my cats get sick and I'm medicating like, you know [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4894.58s)]
*  20 some cats right I get everybody healthy [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4899.0599999999995s)]
*  I train everybody up and that was a really like, you know that there's a pet overpopulation problem [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4902.74s)]
*  You know that there's a problem [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4908.139999999999s)]
*  But until you're thrown into a situation like that where you're actually told these kittens are gonna die today [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4909.179999999999s)]
*  Because no there's no home for them you see people dumping off their cats on a regular basis just leaving them behind [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4915.86s)]
*  You know, they're not part of the family [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4923.06s)]
*  They're just left behind like garbage well cats act like they want to leave all the time to some of it is their fault [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4924.86s)]
*  I'm not gonna say that that should happen, but some of the cats are like [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4930.74s)]
*  Because the person has not invested the time in the cat and that could very well be true and that is part of what [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4936.42s)]
*  That's where the where the change happened. So I got these these 12 kittens [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4944.0199999999995s)]
*  I've ended up finding home for all of them and [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4949.0599999999995s)]
*  I realized that and I went in I got more [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4951.78s)]

*  That part of the not only with just kittens being dumped off [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4973.139999999999s)]
*  But people were leaving their adult cats behind and that's because they felt like their cat didn't care [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4976.54s)]
*  They didn't have a relationship with their cat and that's why I thought well, I can make it different here [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4981.3s)]
*  I so part of the you know, my part of my show is like an educational to inspire people to you know [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4984.94s)]
*  Like me not only can cats do tricks you can teach your cat look at the relationship [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4991.78s)]
*  But my cats act like dogs they follow me around the house [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4996.2s)]
*  I mean I the little kittens that I just started training they follow me around like puppies. They're like whatever you know work [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=4998.8s)]

*  I can help save lives. So not only have I saved, you know actual lives, but I've fostered and found homes for [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5009.84s)]
*  340 cats and kittens since [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5017.240000000001s)]

*  Homes for them right after the show people came and adopt them [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5028.68s)]
*  Well, because we stay in a place for a while they have to fill out they fill out the application [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5031.52s)]
*  We check the references and if they you know get approved they get it [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5036.320000000001s)]

*  They're all comfortable with traveling in a car [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5045.96s)]
*  Which is a big thing and they're all trained to do a parlor trick [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5047.92s)]

*  We were not able to get you know to to that destination [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5251.42s)]
*  so we finally, you know end up getting towed to a proper repair place and [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5255.54s)]
*  It doesn't get fixed in time. So we're having to rent you hauls and [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5260.82s)]

*  March a couple years ago [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5272.38s)]
*  In Texas and when they had that freak snowstorm in Texas [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5275.38s)]

*  You know with everything set up ready to go in case we can do the show and then the bus that was supposed to be [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5286.22s)]

*  obscene amount of money and they want a hotel room that's [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5336.92s)]
*  Crazy expensive like we can't afford that. I want to keep the ticket prices somewhat reasonable [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5341.8s)]
*  I mean we've had to raise the prices [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5347.46s)]
*  Pretty you know intensely as it is [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5349.76s)]

*  Okay, this is what you need to do [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5481.04s)]
*  And then I would go back out and get dressed for the show and then I'd run back out on stage and I do the [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5482.12s)]
*  Opening announcements right and then I'd sell the cat ears because we walk around with a tray cat ears get your cat ears [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5488.320000000001s)]
*  Cat ears get your cat ears [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5493.56s)]
*  so then I sell the cat ears do the opening announcement and then you know, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5494.92s)]
*  Take the cat ears back and then I had a friend that was kind of with me who [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5499.759999999999s)]
*  She didn't she was just there is like more of a friend. She really know how the show went [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5505.5599999999995s)]
*  She hadn't done any rehearsal. So basically she was kind of at least another body on stage. Oh, yeah [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5510.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was just pretty much me up there, you know, you know, like, okay [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5517.32s)]
*  let this cat out now let this cat out now and grabbing the props when I need them and and [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5521.7s)]
*  Explain to the audience like it's just me up here and I know, you know, I've never done this part before so I'm like [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5526.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm looking at this long script. I'm going I'm not gonna say I'm just gonna wing it [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5533.0599999999995s)]
*  So this is a situation so I don't know what's gonna happen [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5536.78s)]
*  But we're just gonna you know, enjoy the cats and and and I had and I learned I mean I learned a lot [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5539.54s)]
*  Yeah after that experience [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5545.58s)]
*  I changed a lot of our you know, the way we sell merch. I was like, this is insane [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5548.34s)]
*  I saw it's like we're gonna make part of the self-serve and and you know, just only the you know important things [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5553.74s)]
*  Do people have to you know dig for to give to the yes [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5560.82s)]
*  So, you know, I just I learned how I learned where some of the with improvements needed to be made [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5564.24s)]
*  Yes, sometimes it's certain things force you in a certain moment and then that's where you learn the most which is kind of wild [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5569.38s)]
*  Yeah, and the show but the show must they all the show must go on. I am one of those like literally [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5574.58s)]
*  The show must go on you don't just decide oh [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5580.2s)]
*  You know, I'm not I'm not feeling it today or I mean I've done like I've had full-on sick work [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5584.28s)]
*  I could have to talk in a whisper, you know, like I'm doing I've got tea on stage [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5590.639999999999s)]
*  Whispering into the microphone because I can barely because I barely have a voice [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5594.96s)]
*  but I'm still doing the best I can and then immediately going and sleeping and [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5598.96s)]
*  Resting a lot. Yeah. Oh, yeah managing yourself and getting all that kind of stuff done [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5605.24s)]
*  Is a lot. Um [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5609.0s)]
*  Was it the bus too, you know, I can't even just and still train the cats and raise the babies the kittens [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5611.72s)]
*  You know that we have portable incubators. So, you know, there's bottle but a lot of times we have bottle babies and we've gotten [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5618.4800000000005s)]
*  Stopped by the police and they're like what's going on here? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5624.64s)]
*  Very rarely I did it's you know, I think that it like the animals bring out the best in people for the most part [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5629.28s)]
*  So we run into so many great people out on the road that have been helpful and come to our rescue [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5636.84s)]
*  well, like is there ever been a perform like a [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5642.88s)]
*  Cat that had it all like a cat that kind of had it all and then just for some reason things just kind of fell [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5645.56s)]
*  Apart like the kind of like the Chris Brown of like cats kind of well they [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5651.6s)]
*  I think we've only had one cat that we were [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5656.04s)]
*  After like a year of trying I was like this cat is just not is not gonna be accurate cat material [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5659.76s)]
*  So we were tied, you know, we we moved him to and I because I also we still train [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5664.84s)]
*  You know cats and other animals for film and television. So I'm like, well this guy he's got he's got model qualities [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5670.32s)]
*  He's a Siamese. He's he's got the Siamese coloring so he could get he could get you know commercial work [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5675.8s)]
*  And so he was transferred to another department [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5681.6s)]
*  That's fair then but a lot of the cats have when they get to that, you know, they decide like okay [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5685.72s)]
*  I'm not gonna do this. I'm not gonna do that or when they get older and [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5690.76s)]
*  And some if they get joint pain [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5695.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5697.2s)]
*  and [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5697.84s)]
*  So then I I scale back on the tricks that I have them do because I certainly don't want them to experience pain [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5698.8s)]
*  Of course not was there ever a trick that you tried to get cats to do and finally you said to be like we can't [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5706.16s)]
*  Make this trick work [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5710.92s)]
*  there it's [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5712.92s)]
*  There's been some that I've tried because there's there's [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5714.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's some Russian cat circuses out there that that hurt there [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5718.36s)]
*  It's a different [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5722.36s)]
*  Kind of I mean they're they're they're sharp [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5724.04s)]
*  Like I mean my cats come out and stretch and groom and just start it's like hiring family [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5727.44s)]
*  They're not professional, but they we know I've seen some pretty [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5732.08s)]
*  Impressive things with these rushing cat circuses where they really high up in the air [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5735.48s)]
*  They do this army crawl and on and at one point I was like, I really want to teach this army crawl [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5739.76s)]
*  But then I looked at it and I was like, how can that possibly be comfortable for the cat? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5744.32s)]
*  It just what it just doesn't seem like it's it's [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5748.04s)]
*  You know, I ended up abandoning attempting that trick because I I looked at it and I thought I [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5753.2s)]
*  Just as it doesn't seem right. It doesn't how can that it's not natural [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5760.04s)]
*  It's not a natural skill at all like balancing on a ball on a barrel climbing a rope jumping down to my back [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5763.88s)]
*  I mean, those are all cat agility type things and they've got great balance [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5769.84s)]
*  You know, none of the props are super high up with you know, oste that's one that jumps to my back [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5775.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's an eight foot high pole. Yeah, I mean and she cheats [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5781.04s)]
*  She crawls down two three feet and then jumps to my back [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5785.04s)]
*  I didn't even know until I saw a video clip that she's been cheating the whole time [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5788.64s)]
*  Yeah, not even doing the true job like Leah Thomas or whatever. Yeah [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5792.56s)]
*  I'm like if you've seen these Russian cats jumping [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5796.4400000000005s)]
*  20 feet up in the air down to a pillow [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5799.04s)]
*  Look it's the same as like when those Russian hamsters came in it kind of changed the game of [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5802.6s)]
*  Hamster sales in our area. I remember that the Russians are very severe about [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5810.08s)]
*  The dictatorship over animals. Oh, yeah, it's a different energy [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5815.68s)]
*  Has there ever been a time where like like you come back at halftime and the cats are all like just bummed out or they're [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5820.68s)]
*  Smoking or whatever. They're just like that's catnip. They get into the catnip [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5827.0s)]
*  They get it get over to that merch table and roll around the catnip. I'm just like, oh no [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5830.320000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, it was like oh and they'll go into the audience and if somebody's bought a catnip toy [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5834.68s)]
*  They'll dig it right out of the purse. So just take it just take it. Oh, yeah, I mean and they'll drink their beer [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5839.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I did like Jax loves beer. So I mean everybody like hold on to your drinks. Do not give this cat beer [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5845.72s)]
*  She loves beer. Don't let her drink the beer. Yeah, it might be a single mother, too [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5851.52s)]
*  Yeah, just [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5856.58s)]
*  Because the cats are always they're opportunists, you know, they're gonna do you know, they're gonna be like I'm just gonna go them [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5858.0599999999995s)]
*  catnip out there see ya and I'm left like [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5863.98s)]
*  What am I supposed to do here? Like with because albacore? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5867.78s)]
*  Just like we supposed to be the star [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5872.0199999999995s)]
*  He's supposed to have this moment where we do a solo in the middle of the show [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5874.4s)]
*  Of course, and it's his highlight and he's just he's like they're they got popcorn out there and PBR [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5877.98s)]
*  I'm just gonna go and I'm like, what do you mean? You're gonna go and he's like, yeah, I'm just gonna go right and I'm like [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5884.5s)]
*  Yeah, but this is your moment. He's like, yeah, I'm just gonna go and I'm standing there. The music is starting [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5889.56s)]
*  I've got I don't have my solo cat. He's just he's just gone to the bar to get a PBR [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5894.900000000001s)]
*  And and some popcorn and I'm like to send out Dixie [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5900.9400000000005s)]
*  So so Dixie comes out and does all the tricks just because she had been doing them [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5904.860000000001s)]
*  You know, she was just bam bam bam did the tricks better than he did [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5909.42s)]
*  She saved the day she saved the day, you know [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5912.86s)]
*  And he comes racing up on stage to try to take over because hey not I want this other cat doing my job [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5915.219999999999s)]
*  You know and he's he's just failing because Dixie's just leaping [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5921.58s)]
*  Oh, you know higher and faster and long doing like he's like three feet behind everything [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5925.78s)]
*  So and that and at that point that's when that that portion of the show turned into a competition [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5930.62s)]
*  so I had to change that portion and [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5935.9s)]
*  Because of that incident and so I'm all constantly having to change and evolve based on like we had a cat that got sick [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5939.219999999999s)]
*  You know in the something was off like the first show we did I was like something's wrong with Bowie [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5946.58s)]
*  So I you know, I'd whispered to my you know, like skip skip this skip this trick skip that trick [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5952.219999999999s)]
*  so then Bowie went to the vet and I had to [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5957.46s)]
*  like rearrange the show and bring out a you know this cat to cover for for this trick for Bowie and [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5961.74s)]
*  You know Oste you're gonna be drumming, you know for both shows and you know [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5968.82s)]
*  Oste's the one that's like what the you know, the one that's always like what do you she's like always? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5973.86s)]
*  What do you got when I get you know, she has to climb up the pole? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5979.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, let me see what you got here [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5981.5s)]
*  Yeah, the eight foot pole and leap to my shoulder where she walks three feet down and then leaps to it [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5982.54s)]
*  She's like she literally is like what do you guys I don't have tuna or salmon and a good piece [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5987.98s)]
*  Like she'll be like not doing it [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5992.82s)]
*  I have to go back and get something better and go how about now and then she'll do it [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5994.86s)]
*  yeah, did you ever have them like any issues where the show couldn't go on or [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=5998.5199999999995s)]

*  Rang it and which of course tuna couldn't resist that was like, oh, that's my trick. It just just [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6084.339999999999s)]

*  Do they do the cats do like a halftime at the show or anything? [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6128.02s)]
*  Is there like a little break you guys all go back in the locker room or anything like that or it's just one full [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6130.9s)]

*  So it's expanded over the years now. It's a nine. We now have a nine piece band [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6142.259999999999s)]
*  It started out as a three piece band and then we you know [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6146.42s)]
*  we added cowbell and then we added chimes and we added a chicken on symbol and tambourine and [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6149.54s)]
*  Then we added a horn section. So now we have trumpet saxophone and clarinet. Oh, it's beautiful [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6154.94s)]

*  I mean, I just love the whole band playing together [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6168.06s)]
*  And then we do the meet-and-greet so people get to come up and depending on the size of the venue [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6171.620000000001s)]
*  If it's up to 150 people can come up and get it do the meet-and-greet where they see the cats up close [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6176.780000000001s)]
*  They can take photos with the band and they get also that that way they can see that because the cats could leave [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6181.900000000001s)]
*  Literally if they're not comfortable or they're freaked out they could just go I mean [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6187.7s)]
*  It's a big theater. There's a curtain they could go in their carrier. They could hide they could go back to outer space [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6192.82s)]
*  also the fact that they're sitting there posing for a picture and just [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6199.72s)]
*  Comfortable with the stampede of people coming up to get photos with that's a lot shows people also that [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6204.78s)]
*  like that this is this is a whole new level of cat and [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6210.82s)]
*  And if she can do it and because my cats do fail [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6214.7s)]
*  I mean they come out and they groom and yeah, have you ever had a cat's fight on stage? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6218.3s)]
*  After the show we've had there's been some some issues where we there's some animosity that I have to keep certain cats separate for sure [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6223.22s)]
*  It's like strippers. Yeah, it's been there's been some some moments where I have to keep you know [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6231.06s)]

*  After it was luckily it was after the show [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6241.86s)]
*  So there was a little little incident afterwards and we got them separated and but you know [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6243.66s)]
*  It's you know [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6248.26s)]

*  Spotters in the audience that it's like, you know [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6256.02s)]
*  Most of the cats are allowed to go out and wander and do their thing [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6258.78s)]
*  But if this cat leaves that's it's because he's they don't he starts. Yeah, he wants to start something [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6261.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah, constantly having to to shift things around when yeah, and just make it work on the fly [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6276.78s)]
*  Yeah, are people allowed to bring cats to the show? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6282.9s)]
*  It would prefer that they don't I mean we've had somebody that occasionally sneak one in [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6285.62s)]
*  But they prefer, you know, and sometimes the service dogs that have to be admitted [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6290.58s)]
*  You know, they have to be at least four rows back so that they don't upset the show. Yeah. Yeah [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6295.42s)]
*  But yeah, that's fair. Yeah, is there after the show you ever celebrated? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6302.26s)]

*  They're not hanging out and watching television at night with it with the animals, right? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6463.74s)]
*  It's a very it's almost like being like Russian almost. Yeah, very Russian people [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6467.34s)]
*  You know in Russia some of the children even have dolls that are made out of stone and you would see kids with like a [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6471.9s)]
*  Three or four pound doll like that's crazy [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6476.22s)]

*  So it's it's just I mean I had to make a choice at one point either I can have a slick show or I can [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6484.98s)]
*  Enjoy the enjoy being with the animals, right? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6492.02s)]

*  Sometimes do it and sometimes don't and it actually is more encouraging because we sell training kits after the show [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6501.46s)]
*  So people can train their cats. Oh people can do it. Yeah [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6508.06s)]

*  Has completely changed and the behavioral problems have stopped because I started paying attention and training my cat [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6531.1s)]
*  So there's so many benefits. There's health benefits. Yeah, cuz a lot of people just think cats are fucking crazy [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6537.02s)]

*  That you need to give them something to do with their brain and I say they're even from outer space [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6549.46s)]
*  Do you ever feel anything like that? No, I mean, I I mean I think that they're just very independent [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6554.42s)]

*  Whatever where cats are grudge holders and very like no, you know stubborn and you know [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6566.46s)]
*  You really have to work within you know within the cats [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6572.22s)]
*  You have to make it fun for the cat for sure you have to find out what the cat likes to do [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6575.08s)]
*  I mean I spent a lot of time just hanging out with the cats watching them [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6579.2s)]
*  Especially like the group of kittens we have you know, they're all running around. I'm seeing who's climbing who's who's you know, who's perching who's [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6583.04s)]
*  Who's using their paw like what what what is this cat? What you know, what can this cat do? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6591.2s)]
*  What what should I focus on? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6596.24s)]
*  So I you know just by hanging out with the cats and watching what they do [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6597.8s)]
*  That's how I'm inspired by to come up with with a trick to coordinate what you know what they can do Wow [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6601.16s)]
*  If you had to pick like a Mount Rushmore of like your best performing cats and you had to put four of them on it [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6608.16s)]
*  Obviously tuna the original tunas on there who else is on there? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6613.4s)]
*  Boy the I mean Oste is very solid in the slow [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6617.76s)]
*  slowly, I mean just [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6624.12s)]

*  Pretty good [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6631.08s)]
*  Albuquerque tuna is solid but to you know [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6632.48s)]
*  It's kind of riding the coattails of you know, like the original tuna like he doesn't really feel like he has to prove himself [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6635.0s)]
*  You know, he's like I'll do the minimum and where tuna had a really original tuna had a really great work ethic [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6640.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what's nice. Yeah, having that is very nice and then I have [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6646.4s)]
*  Newt is my youngest and she is a man just crazy. You mean I [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6651.0s)]

*  Yeah [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6668.16s)]
*  So a lot of times what because I'm training fast and shaping is what? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6668.5599999999995s)]
*  Shaping is when you just sit with clicker and treats and you wait for the cat to do something and then the cat has to figure [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6672.04s)]
*  Out what it is you want to do without any clue for us. You let them learn it. I let them learn teach themselves [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6677.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's really the best way. Yes, and then they're like, oh I heard the click so okay [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6683.88s)]
*  What you know, like you just see the light come on in their eyes once they [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6688.62s)]
*  You know that light bulb moment where they get it. They're like, oh, I think I get it [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6693.8s)]
*  I thought you know because at first they're just like what is it that you want, you know? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6699.16s)]
*  Like I just don't get it and then they hear the click and they're okay [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6703.400000000001s)]
*  Something to do with the paw right something to do with this paw something to do with this keyboard [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6706.76s)]
*  Oh, I think it's the keyboard like oh, okay, and you know, you just sit and you just wait then they're playing them stairway [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6710.96s)]
*  And then yeah, you're just lamb. Yeah, it's and then when you see that light come on and they're just they get it [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6717.08s)]
*  I mean, so they basically they learn to learn and then they get creative too [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6724.56s)]
*  And now they'll come up with their own tricks or you know [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6729.64s)]
*  You'll start training them to do one thing and they'll be like no I want to do this instead [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6733.08s)]
*  And I love that about them that the creativity of that that cats have it the fact and and the fact that they're negotiators [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6736.320000000001s)]
*  Too because I mean once I'm on stage, I'm like in front of an audience [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6743.12s)]
*  I can't I can't like reset and be like, okay [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6746.68s)]

*  I have to just go with the flow and they know that I you know, they I'm a little stuck [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6753.12s)]
*  So they'll be like I'm not gonna do this but I'll do this instead [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6758.16s)]
*  Oh [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6761.0s)]
*  The most cat thing I've heard all day, yeah, I'll do this instead [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6763.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I do this instead we had a guy we had a corner on he said that cats would eat people if they passed [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6768.28s)]
*  Away, have you ever heard that? Well, I totally believe it. I mean they said yeah [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6774.46s)]
*  This guy said a cat could even eat your face within like 30 something hours or something if they wanted to oh, yeah [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6779.88s)]
*  I mean I respect that about cats a dog will die right along beside you a cat's gonna be like [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6784.72s)]
*  Has she taken her last breath? Maybe I'll start early [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6789.66s)]
*  But I respect that I [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6794.66s)]
*  Respect the cats are gred shoulders too like they you do something that that they don't like, you know [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6796.66s)]
*  They like write it in their little book and like I'm gonna remember this [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6802.26s)]
*  You just did this and so yeah [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6805.94s)]
*  And I really do respect that about cats because they are not as forgiving which is why you know, you have to [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6808.62s)]
*  Really, you know make it, you know, it can never be forced. It's gotta be fun [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6815.34s)]
*  for the cat and [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6820.0599999999995s)]
*  They really are they mean it yeah, yeah, you're not gonna get anything for free out of a cat [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6824.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And you know, but if it's a high, you know reward like if it's a salmon [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6828.86s)]
*  I mean, that's like okay [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6835.54s)]
*  I'm gonna drum a little bit more for the salmon than I will for the chicken, you know, where the youngsters the kittens are like chicken [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6836.88s)]
*  That's great. We'll do everything. They don't know. Yeah, they don't know but the season ones [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6843.22s)]
*  They're like, yeah, let's see what you got here that chick that salmon looks a little dry. You got anything better? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6846.84s)]
*  just yeah, so and I've had the cats that same cat go up that pole four times in a show and [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6852.2s)]
*  Just wait up there and I have to stop [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6858.72s)]
*  Oh my god, you know what cuz I'm at this part of the show and then off these back up on that pole [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6860.72s)]
*  Because she left instead of going back to her carrier went back up the pole because she liked the particular cooking that day [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6866.28s)]
*  The cooking was good that day. So she's like I want more [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6872.22s)]
*  So now the shows changed a little we're gonna keep we're gonna do maybe some different things that we might not have done [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6874.96s)]
*  Yes, and I got a back go back over there [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6879.06s)]
*  Do you assume the position where I'm like leaning over she does the jump to my back and then sometimes leaves again? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6881.72s)]
*  Yeah, and then ends up back on that pole and people are like pointing and I'm like, oh again [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6888.26s)]
*  So a lot of just watching you work with cats [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6893.36s)]
*  It's like just the reality is that it's almost impossible what we're gonna do our best. Yeah. Yeah [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6895.76s)]
*  I'm just standing there like my you know, my arm flung out at this cat grooming and because [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6901.92s)]
*  especially because I mean I had [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6908.2s)]
*  Probably one of the worst experiences I ever did early on in my career [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6910.72s)]
*  I got a week long gig in Branson and because popovich abandoned Branson for this for the gig in [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6915.0s)]
*  Vegas so they had no cat act and they have billboards people were traveling miles to see that [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6924.08s)]
*  His cats and so they hired this guy to put together another act to take the place of this so he hired a dog act [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6929.48s)]
*  a bird act and then a cat act and it was he had so a Russian some a couple Russian people coming in with cats [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6937.48s)]
*  But he had one week where he didn't they weren't available [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6944.92s)]
*  So he brought me in on the advice of somebody who had never seen my show [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6947.72s)]
*  And they you know people are expecting this, you know, this is a big opportunity because you're coming into Branson [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6953.04s)]
*  Yeah full theater. I mean tuna ran off stage the very first rehearsal [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6958.16s)]
*  I'm oh it was just I mean the hell the the guy he was like it [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6962.36s)]
*  Listen, you know your act is just I'm not you're supposed to be the headliner [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6967.64s)]
*  but you can't be something had to bury you in the middle and [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6971.28s)]
*  And then in the meantime, you know [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6974.04s)]
*  The dog people hated us because we weren't organized the bird people hated us because the cats wanted to eat the birds [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6975.88s)]
*  Yeah [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6980.82s)]
*  So and I'm just mortified because the cats aren't doing anything in that and the cats are super sensitive [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6981.2s)]
*  So they're feeling the hate from the audience, right? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6986.48s)]
*  you know because their people are expecting awesome cats and they're getting Samantha's not so amazing agro cats and [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=6989.16s)]

*  You know like when you know when a cat did something you just commit to it like look at that [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7014.04s)]
*  The cat's doing nothing, but isn't that great? [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7019.28s)]
*  You know and and just really exaggerate the moves, you know, you know not do no teapot arms [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7021.84s)]

*  Little bit but it's really and I think what went wrong there is that there were two [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7103.64s)]
*  Things because they pick up on nervous energy [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7108.4800000000005s)]
*  So if I'm nervous they're nervous and then I had all these extra assistants that were like we want to be on the show [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7110.72s)]
*  So we had too many people involved too much energy and they felt it and they felt all that nervous energy [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7115.719999999999s)]
*  So they were like, oh we can't we're not gonna do we just can't do this [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7122.2s)]
*  So just like we really can't do [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7125.04s)]
*  When people want to hire us for an event [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7127.839999999999s)]
*  And it's a mixed bag of people like some are cat lovers some aren't like my cats feel that energy [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7130.44s)]
*  They're like we're we don't feel the love. Yeah, so that's why we do that. We rent out a theater, you know [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7137.879999999999s)]
*  We're not really for hire. Right. It's more we want cat lovers to come. Yeah, so it's a self-produced show [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7144.8s)]
*  So I rent out the theater we do the advertising we do marketing we do, you know do everything from the beginning [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7150.320000000001s)]
*  and [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7157.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, it's hard to find venues that'll even let you know that let us for sure [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7158.64s)]
*  I mean, well, it's hard to find humans that will believe in what you're doing [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7162.52s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a lot of people think it's absolutely insane to drive around in a [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7165.52s)]
*  Van with 11 cats or something. They think it's insane [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7170.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's something that you see of like a hoarder or somebody that's a [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7173.2s)]
*  some freelance [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7178.16s)]
*  Noah's Arkie and type of human, you know [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7181.72s)]
*  But I think when you see that you love it so much and that your goal or a lot of your goal is something to get [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7184.4s)]
*  These cats into like big-time programming and get them fun opportunities if they want if they want it and also to kind of meet [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7191.36s)]
*  The cats where they are. It's like if they're not [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7198.44s)]
*  If some of them don't have it they don't have it you don't have to tell them that really you just work with where they [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7201.08s)]
*  Are willing to work exactly work within their parameters [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7205.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and then and you know inspiring people to to train their own cats [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7208.879999999999s)]
*  and and I know I've had I've saved like I've saved some of my own cats lives just because [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7213.12s)]
*  Because of the training routine like, you know [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7218.96s)]
*  Like I would have band practice every time anytime I cooked the because the band is set up in the kitchen [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7221.24s)]
*  Anybody you know the band comes running and they take their place on their instruments and they start playing because they want they want [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7226.660000000001s)]
*  You know, what song will they play? It's all freeform jazz. It's like their own music [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7232.9400000000005s)]
*  So it's you know, not all of it not not a lot of them are big hits [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7238.02s)]
*  I would say but it's our own [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7241.900000000001s)]
*  Alphabet City in New York for a little bit and you would hear a lot of some of that at certain nights or whatever [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7244.18s)]
*  But yeah, but the one cat like my guitar player. She was solids my best guitar player ever [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7248.620000000001s)]
*  She didn't show up for band practice [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7253.34s)]
*  like she always showed up for band practice and I found I went looking for and she was like sitting in front of the [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7254.74s)]
*  Fireplace and and I even offered her free freebie like you know, but take this and she was like not interested [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7259.5s)]
*  I was like something's wrong with Pinky [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7265.1s)]
*  So I took her to the vet and she had a fever and I might not have noticed anything was wrong for [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7266.42s)]
*  For several days to the point of where it was too late [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7271.38s)]
*  But because I had a routine established and because I have a routine established with these cats [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7274.22s)]
*  You know even blowing the whistle for feeding time [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7279.02s)]
*  You can tell within five minutes if something's wrong with somebody just where they might have a limp [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7281.34s)]
*  They might be favoring one side of their mouth and they chew, you know, like something's wrong [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7285.58s)]
*  you know, I can tell just because I've [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7289.9800000000005s)]
*  Established a routine and it doesn't you know, you don't have to put together a huge act like I have you can just [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7293.34s)]
*  One simple trick. Yeah, you know [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7299.82s)]
*  even just the whistle to the carrier will give you all the information you need to know whether or not your cat needs to [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7301.82s)]
*  Go to the vet and now you can take your cat to the vet because it's already [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7306.42s)]
*  Oriented to a carrier because when we do fostering and we adopt them out they're all they're already all used to traveling [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7310.1s)]
*  Do you feel like they are the performers or that you are the performer? I [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7316.34s)]
*  I think that I'm it's it's a kids a combination. We're both we're we're we play off each other like so so [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7321.78s)]
*  Whatever, you know, whatever is happening with them [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7329.54s)]
*  and you know, we'll [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7333.26s)]
*  Will cut you know causes my you know, so it's it's both we're so we're both performers by definitely the improv thing [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7335.5s)]
*  it's I mean I have to be like [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7342.74s)]
*  Just be on and also but not nervous either. So [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2K-XB7Ha_I&t=7345.26s)]
