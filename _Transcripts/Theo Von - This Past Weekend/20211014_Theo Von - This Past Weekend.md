*  suddenly like [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=120.28s)]
*  Why feel like I feel like snakes create so much fear in me that right when I see you I want to tell you about it [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=121.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah, you're the middle man for yeah, you know, and I'm really good at getting people over their fears, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=128.4s)]
*  You know, like that's one of the things I pride myself on, you know [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=134.02s)]
*  I mean every single week we have dozens and dozens of people that come to my reptiles who they're like I am terrified and I'm [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=136.54s)]
*  Like your pace, but I guarantee you by time we're done. You're gonna be holding snakes [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=142.68s)]

*  Yeah, I don't know if I want it, you know, I think I think snakes for some reason create so much fear in me, you know [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=155.96s)]
*  Why is it that snake is that fear animal? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=163.52s)]
*  You know, I think it's you know, I mean it goes back to probably a bunch of things right biblical number one number two [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  They are an either love them or hate them, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=172.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=175.46s)]
*  And there's that that thing I always talk about like, you know [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=176.1s)]
*  I think Howard Stern once said the thing like similar where it's like if you love snakes [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=178.62s)]
*  You want to talk to me if you hate snakes you want to talk to me more, you know [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=182.78s)]

*  Oh, it wasn't like an Indian baby like they do, you know, yeah like they do it was like a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=210.46s)]

*  Nightmares about snakes since I was like two years old and she said and I started like memory. Yeah. Yeah exactly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=308.78s)]

*  Then eventually she held her first day by time when she was done [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=334.3s)]
*  She's holding giant snakes and stuff like that and she's actually come back two or three times since because she's like now I love them [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=337.34000000000003s)]

*  You know, it's at the zoo. It's my first memory. I was a kid first memory [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=354.62s)]
*  My mom said I was two years old have a crazy memory, right? But literally I remember that cage [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  I remember the smell in the air. I remember everything like it was like and from that time I was just obsessed [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, I just and no one in my family had snakes. Everyone thought I was crazy [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  You know what? I mean, like I loved them and my mom hated them [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=371.26s)]
*  She was terrified of them and finally when I was 15 years old after you know, whatever, you know [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=374.14s)]
*  My entire life begging her for snakes [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=378.9s)]
*  She finally let me get us a snake and it turned out it was a Burmese python [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=380.7s)]
*  Which is by the way, you were snake you could possibly get as a first snake because they get like 18 foot [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=384.03999999999996s)]

*  Turns out one time I was over there, you know, so still gotta take care of them [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=660.28s)]
*  Right and I accidentally left one cage open, right? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=663.8s)]
*  But the downside was that snake got out of the cage and then opened up a bunch of other cages [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=667.94s)]
*  So my mom calls me like three in the morning. Do that like Madagascar? Yeah [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=672.2s)]
*  It's like let all your friends out, you know [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=677.44s)]
*  See that's the thing that I understand sometimes is how [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=681.12s)]
*  like [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=684.48s)]
*  Do they know more than we think they know? Oh, yeah [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  Gee, oh, they're so much smarter than you think dude [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=689.84s)]
*  I mean mostly we have snakes that literally are like ball trained and what I mean by that is [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=692.2s)]
*  No, I think it's great I think every person in the planet should have a pet snake [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=699.12s)]
*  Including you [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=704.76s)]
*  Let me ask you this man, yeah you touched on it a second ago people on drugs being with snakes should somebody that's high [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=706.56s)]
*  Cuz first two questions one. I think I remember I remember [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=714.0s)]
*  My friend Alex had a snake he would feed it [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=719.76s)]
*  We he would feed his snake dog food pieces. Is that possible was I you're probably high you're probably high [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=722.76s)]
*  Okay, I mean, I'm not gonna say that it can't happen. I'm just saying that I've never seen it [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=729.3399999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah, cuz I was I've had this memory my whole life and then I'm like, I don't know if maybe we're high [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=734.3s)]
*  So then the second part is do you think drug induced people should be around snakes and what sorry answer? No [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=738.62s)]
*  No, and talk you listen, you know any animal especially a reptile or a big cat or you know [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=746.5799999999999s)]
*  Something that could potentially hurt you and you know, listen a lot of snake can't hurt you but I'm talking a bigger snake [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, we have a rule that like number one [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  You can't even go in with a big animal without a second person with you in our place [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=759.3199999999999s)]
*  But uh, and no one can be intoxicated on any level. Okay, say you have to be intoxicated, right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=763.42s)]
*  Okay, federal mandate. Yeah, you know and I'm not talking like with the vaccine [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=768.9s)]
*  I'm talking like federally mandated you gotta be got to be high some type of drug [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=772.98s)]
*  Yeah, what is this best drug to be on around a snake? Probably marijuana, you know, cuz chills you out [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=777.34s)]
*  You know, maybe they've sensed little energy thing or something. I know a lot of keepers that smoke a lot of reefer [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=783.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I feel like that fits now [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=788.74s)]
*  What is a drug that would you would not recommend probably being on around a definitely not like mushrooms or LSD? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=791.68s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be a bad idea. Really? Yeah, I mean you're barely knowing what's going on [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=796.64s)]
*  You got some snakes striking at you, you know, you think it's maybe a goblin or something like that [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like is a snake more likely to strike at you if you have [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=805.36s)]
*  Sunglasses on [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=811.16s)]
*  Probably not [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=814.04s)]
*  Some animals would I would say like lizards like giant lizards and stuff like that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=815.48s)]
*  They get a little freaked out by stuff like that. They're more visual. You know what I mean snakes aren't as visual [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=820.36s)]
*  What about skin lotion like a vino skin lotion? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=824.88s)]
*  basic moisturizer [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=828.12s)]
*  Probably nothing too major to be honest with you [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=829.88s)]
*  I've never seen anything too agitated by smells and stuff like that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=832.4000000000001s)]
*  We get a lot of people in our zoo that handle a lot of stuff and they there's all kinds of smells from [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=835.6400000000001s)]
*  Bertouli oil to to yeah, you know Calvin Klein [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  What is I'll tell you something real quick not snake related if you ever go to like a big cat [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=843.44s)]
*  Sanctuary type of thing with lions and tigers don't wear a Calvin Klein because they almost all for some reason [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=848.76s)]
*  Spray Calvin Klein on boxes for enrichment [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=854.28s)]
*  So they'll throw the box with Calvin Klein in the cage and then the tiger lion loves it [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=857.0s)]
*  They rub all over it and stuff. So it's like now every time they smell Kevin Klein. They're thinking I can eat that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=861.7s)]
*  So don't do that's a little little tip. You'll like that tip when uh [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=866.32s)]
*  How far can a snake see? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=871.36s)]
*  Depends on the snake, you know, like a king cobra's real visual it could probably see a pretty good distance [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=874.04s)]
*  You know several maybe 20 30 yards something like that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=878.92s)]
*  Pythons don't have a lot of great high sight, you know, probably three four foot something like that [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=882.1800000000001s)]
*  Can snakes dance, you know, like you see a lot of those videos snakes dancing in other countries and stuff [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=886.32s)]
*  It's more like a combat for males, right? So if you get two male snakes particular species, they'll do like the kind of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=890.84s)]
*  Stuff like that, but they're not dancing. They're fighting. Okay. Yeah [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=898.64s)]
*  Is there do reptiles go through a popularity phase like in your lifetime? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=902.24s)]
*  Have you noticed popularity phases for certain types of reptiles or anything like that and what kind of creates those? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=907.44s)]
*  Do you know I tell you listen when I was you know when I was a kid in the late 80s [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=915.08s)]
*  Getting into snakes and you were like a closet like snake guy. You didn't tell anyone you kept snakes, right? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=919.4000000000001s)]
*  Now homosexuality of animals really maybe not quite that bad, but but but it was close [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=924.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you definitely got looked at as a freak [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  Guys a killer is I'm like that but now it's like literally I think there's like 40 million households in America keeps nakes [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=935.96s)]
*  So it's crazy how busy I mean, it's like every pet shop has them [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=941.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're super popular, you know [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  So I've just seen a kind of upward trajectory to be totally honest with you since the late 80s early 90s [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=947.74s)]
*  Now it's like so mainstream to keep snakes, you know, I mean everyone [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=954.24s)]
*  Everyone knows somebody that has a snake. Yeah, you've got to know somebody right? Oh, I know a guy right actually [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=958.68s)]
*  You know what? We got a question from somebody. I do know who has one [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=964.92s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie. I am NOT a fan of the ova on never have been never will be but I love Brian [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=968.92s)]
*  So here's the question Brian. What kind of animal should I get to? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=974.76s)]
*  Put inside someone's house when they're not home to scare or intimidate them [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=980.16s)]
*  I don't want any death or violence to occur. Maybe just a lot of fear [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=984.88s)]
*  Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you so much and interesting how he didn't blink once during all of that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=990.56s)]
*  That's true, which I want to say that's definitely remind you [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=995.76s)]
*  Mustache is a little freaky to be totally honest with you, but it fits his entire interior [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=998.2s)]
*  Yeah, I would do a complete darkness. Listen, I would do something like a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1002.6s)]
*  Like a black racer blue racer something fast, right that way when you see it, it's just like [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1006.72s)]
*  You know the faster something moves the more scary it is right and there you do they can they go on top of the water [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1012.84s)]
*  Even those oh my gosh. Yeah. Yeah, I was in South Africa a couple years back and we collected a couple black mambas [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1017.84s)]
*  Right and we wanted to release them and so we went down to a river and our IP also. Yeah [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1024.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you what black black mambas are I mean, they're they're wicked. I mean, oh definitely they want I mean listen [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1029.54s)]
*  You know, no snakes are aggressive, but they're defensive [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1036.16s)]
*  You muck with a black mamba it's quick and it's willing to bite you and it's not a good bite [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1039.74s)]
*  It's matter of fact. I was at the same trip [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1044.1s)]
*  I was at a venom lab and we did some milking of venom for antivenin [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1046.22s)]
*  And just about three weeks later the guy that I was with got killed by the same place [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1049.2s)]
*  I was yeah. Yeah, I got bit and died [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1053.74s)]
*  But so we released the black mambas into this area that had this nice river [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1055.58s)]
*  And I mean they just glide on the top of the river. It's absolutely it's to me. It's stunning and beautiful [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1059.02s)]
*  This is them right here. Yeah [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1063.96s)]
*  I mean they're crazy and they call them black mambas because the inside of their mouth is black not because they're a black snake [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1065.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. They're more like a grayish green snake to be honest, right? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1070.22s)]
*  But they're you know, they get like nine ten foot super whippy and super willing to bite and they're you know, like a Ferrari kind of [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1073.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they're fast. I mean like a Porsche. They always say like, you know, hey [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1079.6999999999998s)]
*  I've been messing with venomous since I was 15 and and they always say like the most experienced venomous guy if you're handling either a [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1083.22s)]
*  Mamba or a coastal taipan you look like you don't know what you're doing [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1089.56s)]
*  That's how that's how crazy they are like even when you know what you're doing, you don't look like you know what you're doing [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1093.3s)]
*  Damn. Yeah, so even so at that level a black mamba. We even you will handle it differently [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1098.38s)]
*  You'll have more fear in you at that point never fear [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1102.74s)]
*  I always say don't fear respect, but I definitely respect a black mamba tremendous my especially if you get out in the you know [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1104.98s)]
*  The African Sun it's like 95 degrees sunny [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1110.6000000000001s)]
*  They're soaking up the rays and you gotta remember animals are you know, these animals are cold-blooded [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1113.42s)]
*  So when it's warm, they're faster because they're higher temperature and I mean I've had a couple [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1117.02s)]
*  You know real close encounters with black mambas and coastal taipans in Australia as well [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1122.4s)]
*  But so is it better to put ice on a snake before you approach it then? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1127.56s)]
*  You know, I wouldn't do it because it's probably not that good for the snake [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1131.24s)]
*  You know, it's it's not good to cool them down like that [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1134.44s)]
*  But the cooler they are the more Miller and if you go in the into Africa during the winter months, which of course are summer months [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1136.44s)]
*  You know, they're chill. Okay, this is cool. Well, here's the question. Let's bring those mommas back up if you don't mind [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1143.28s)]
*  The [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1148.4399999999998s)]
*  The yeah now this snake right here what what is the benefit of having that black mouth inside of its body? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1150.72s)]
*  It's all about danger, you know threat, you know, like basically, you know, someone comes up. It's gonna open that mouth [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1156.4399999999998s)]
*  It's gonna look really dangerous [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1162.72s)]
*  Get away from me. Don't muck with me [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1164.52s)]
*  You gotta remember like snakes don't want to be messed with and they also don't want to bite you [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1166.34s)]
*  They don't want to bite you but they will bite you if if you you know get into their space, right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1170.22s)]
*  Who's trying to kill a snake what are they afraid of I never met anybody trying to kill a snake or animal [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1174.8s)]
*  Oh my gosh snakes are you know, listen, you know, it's it's all a [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1179.52s)]
*  Circle of life, right? I mean, you know, but I feel like it's a frickin coldest [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1184.56s)]
*  I feel like it is a damn you turn of life for them because I I what animals trying to get them [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1188.2s)]
*  Oh my gosh, so, you know from anything from you know, like mongoose for instance over in Africa [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1193.3s)]
*  They're actually immune to the venom. They love killing snakes, right? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1197.92s)]
*  You know, so and then when there's a smaller snake birds will get them, you know, I mean gosh, you know Africa's [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1201.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I've seen a Falcon get one. Yeah or a Hulk. Yeah Wow [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1206.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I didn't think about that. So that's such a predator too because you can't even see that coming from the air [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1210.8s)]
*  That's like an airplane came down and got one of us [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1215.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1217.6s)]
*  And then when you have like I said you have a mongoose or something like that that literally can get bit and it's almost like [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1218.6s)]
*  They get drunk [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1223.3999999999999s)]
*  You know if you ever you want to go down a rabbit hole just watch like mongoose is getting bit by Cobras [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1224.04s)]
*  Because they actually it's like they they like walk around get drunk [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1229.04s)]
*  They'll fall over then they just get right back up and then go back the honey badgers will do the same thing [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1231.92s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. So when they get bit they it affects them for a little bit. It's like in the back [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1236.08s)]
*  Yeah, like almost like it's they're drunk or something for a minute and then they're like, alright, I'm ready for round two [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1240.48s)]
*  Let's go happiness doesn't come easy these days [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1244.82s)]
*  It can be a perspective change. It can be a [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1249.04s)]
*  mission for some [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1252.92s)]
*  For some it's a natural element [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1254.88s)]

*  Their decisions my wife does have a pretty good scar from a tiger [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1600.54s)]
*  Sorry, but some of these bitches deserve it not your lady, but I'm just saying I'm glad to know tigers are on our team [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1606.34s)]

*  You sustained while messing around with those little critters those little reptiles and [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1632.3s)]
*  amphibians and snakes [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1638.6599999999999s)]
*  They look pretty pretty dangerous. I'm curious how long you've been hospitalized or what the worst injury was but uh [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1640.66s)]
*  Appreciate you guys the oh my dude gang gang gang brother. Thanks for the question. That's a good question Brian [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1648.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you get asked it a lot. Yeah, and I kind of you know [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1654.5800000000002s)]
*  Almost covered it right where I've never been hurt really right, you know, I'm I have a few scars [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1656.94s)]
*  I don't want snakes to hear that. Yeah, I want snakes. I want animals to hear that right here [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1661.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we got a guy who just entered the ring. I'm not saying it's a royal rumble [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1666.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm saying it's a royal rumble dude that just entered the ring [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1669.86s)]
*  I'm daring has suffered zero damage points. Okay. Yeah, this guy is that has all of his hit points snakes [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1674.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and yeah, I'm telling you what we uh, it's shot. It's honestly it shocks me [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1681.34s)]
*  Do you feel like when you start to see that you haven't been damaged you haven't had any hit points yet [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1686.3s)]
*  That you think there is something in certain people's bloods [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1692.1s)]
*  Do you notice that maybe Native Americans don't get it bit as much that blacks don't get bit as much who is getting bit [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1696.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, I do think that you know, I don't think it's a if it's women it's women. Yeah. Yeah, I think no [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1704.6999999999998s)]
*  I think it's I always talk about confidence [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1710.74s)]
*  Yeah, right [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1713.1s)]
*  Like if you can read so you listen everybody had like you might have a puppy and you're like I know what that puppy wants [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1713.6599999999999s)]
*  I know it wants food. I want you know, some people have that same [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1719.02s)]
*  Mentality with animals at all like I can tell when I get in with a tiger if it's gonna be [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1722.6200000000001s)]
*  Chill and I know the like I can tell before it's gonna want to attack me when it's gonna do it and same thing with reptiles [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1727.6200000000001s)]
*  I can just oh I can look at a reptile at a zoo and be like, okay that needs a little bit more food [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1734.0200000000002s)]
*  It means, you know, it's that's aggro. That's whatever the kid, you know [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1738.22s)]
*  So I think that confidence and the ability to read them and that could be something that's natural [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1741.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know that you can learn. I mean you can learn like my wife Laurie. She wasn't a reptile person [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1746.24s)]
*  She's learned to really deal with reptiles [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1751.62s)]
*  But you know, I just I've always been that way like I've always been able to read like every animal and maybe or maybe I'm just [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1753.1799999999998s)]
*  lucky, I don't know maybe I'm testing fate all the time, but I [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1759.74s)]
*  You know you give me a challenge [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1764.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm in for it when it is part of that it when it comes to being around reptiles cuz it's just I [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1765.5s)]
*  Wouldn't think it was crazy if it wasn't something that struck up so much fear [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  We had a blind lady that was on the podcast one time [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1774.62s)]
*  We're just talking about all kinds of stuff what it's like to be blind and different [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1777.58s)]
*  inquiries and blind inquiries and [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1781.78s)]
*  She said the craziest thing we're talking about animals. She said the craziest thing is snakes [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1785.34s)]
*  She's like I get nothing from a snake like other animals. I can hold I can feel I can get some kind of energy from them [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1789.58s)]
*  But a snake I just don't get anything from it. And that's when I knew dog y'all was fucking up [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1795.6599999999999s)]
*  I was saying that's what I knew y'all was out there dark art [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1802.22s)]
*  I don't know. So do you think that you get a reading from snakes? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1806.22s)]
*  Like do you think it's a temptation to battle like this? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1810.06s)]
*  This this thing that's so scary to other people like is there any of that in it for you? Yeah, I think that [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1813.94s)]
*  You know most people that are really into reptiles. There's a little bit of like outlandish [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1821.38s)]
*  You know, you want to be a little bit of an outlaw like type of thing [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1826.94s)]
*  I think that you're a little you don't you know, follow the same path as everybody else. There's no doubt about that [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1829.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the snake. I was always a crazy guy. Yeah, you know, I mean that's it's kind of cool to be the crazy guy in a way [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1834.04s)]
*  Yeah, but people always are surprised how like I may do crazy things, but I'm not that crazy [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1838.92s)]
*  The snake guy was always a really cool guy though. Yeah. Yeah, like you said, you know when you earlier on like hey [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1844.6s)]
*  Did what do you think about the women? I tell you what guys with snakes always get the women [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1850.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what fascinates them. I don't know if because you're you're rebel, you know [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1855.08s)]
*  But it seems like all my snake friends always hooking up with the hottest chicks [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1860.88s)]
*  Do you feel like a lot of that snakes that snakes know it's you if you have a snake [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1865.24s)]
*  Do you think a snake knows it's you? You know, that's a tough question, man [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1870.74s)]
*  I think that there's something that's called anthropomorphism right when we start, you know applying our human feelings to an animal [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1874.0s)]
*  Right, you know people do it with everybody with their dogs even the anthropomorphize. Yeah. Yeah people start looking like they're animals, too [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1881.22s)]
*  They say all the time and sometimes it's true. Yeah, I agree with you there [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1886.5600000000002s)]
*  So I don't know, you know, I'd like to there are certainly reptiles that know me my reptile [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1889.36s)]
*  You know lizards and some other things like that and you know, they know you well [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1894.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean literally I have a rhino iguana that her name is Bella [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1898.52s)]
*  She'll only come to me like when I call her she'll come to me when I call her my crew [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1902.1599999999999s)]
*  She won't come to you know, so she's you know, and a lot of my animals act very differently with snakes [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1906.32s)]
*  They act different to me as well [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1911.2s)]
*  But is I wonder sometimes is that my like calmness with them that's making them calm with me [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1912.96s)]
*  You know what? I mean? I don't know that they were I just don't know you can't read that with the snake [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1919.3999999999999s)]
*  And if I said her and told you I did I think people think I was kooky. Mm-hmm [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1923.24s)]
*  Do you feel sometimes though like there's some kind of connection like some of them I'll see an animal brawn [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1928.3799999999999s)]
*  I'll be like dude. There's some piece of me inside of me. That's also inside of that animal [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1933.5s)]
*  Do you feel that with snakes sometimes because we're all come out of nature? Yeah, I mean, I think we're all connected, right? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1938.24s)]
*  You know, but I don't think that I'm like part of us [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1943.6399999999999s)]
*  I think but I do think that you know, we're all kind of interconnected through energies and stuff like that [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1946.48s)]
*  And so I think that that's that's what I always say, you know, if you have [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1951.3600000000001s)]
*  Confidence you have like positive energy. You're less likely to get bit. Okay less likely to get hurt [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1955.4s)]
*  You know, it's when you're afraid of stuff, you know [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1960.72s)]
*  Or even like when you're catching a snake and I had one of my crew out and we were in Florida and like he wanted [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1962.7s)]
*  To catch this little Liz, you know how little lizards running around in Florida all the time [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1968.8000000000002s)]
*  And he's like, oh let me go catch this and he gets close and he gets any hesitates, right? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1971.96s)]
*  Yeah, and then the lizard runs away and I'm like you can't hesitate, you know, it's just like when you play that guy in a movie [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1975.64s)]
*  I think yeah [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1980.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's me. Yeah. No, it's even like with the crocodile like if you're gonna catch a crocodile the last I mean, you know [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1981.76s)]
*  again, we're in a place called Josini Africa and we were it actually was crazy I was I was filming a documentary and [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1987.4s)]
*  We hook up with this guy, you know, Josini is the largest [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1993.88s)]
*  population of [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1998.16s)]
*  Nile crocodiles in one area in South Africa [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=1999.76s)]
*  And it's it's yeah Josini and it's you know [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2003.68s)]
*  tons of big wild crocs and so the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2007.32s)]
*  Biologists that had been studying him for over a year was named mark, right? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2009.88s)]
*  And so my my fixtures for the show like hooked up with this guy and like hey, well, I catch a croc [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2013.4s)]
*  We'll do some research, you know some skew samples, whatever the case is toxicology stuff [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2017.92s)]
*  And so we go out on this boat we get there we got we only have a day and a half, right? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2021.8s)]
*  We go out on a boat and we're gonna catch a croc for this film [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2025.8s)]
*  Right, we got the whole film crew with us stuff like that. We're like and he's like, alright [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2028.6s)]
*  This is what we're gonna do. We got this noose on the end of a pole [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2032.0s)]
*  We're gonna try to you know, get to the bank [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2034.32s)]
*  They're all on the banks and and as they come out you noose them and then we can pull them over to land [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2036.36s)]
*  Right and so, you know at one croc after another explodes in the water gone explodes in the water gone [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2040.6799999999998s)]
*  Hours and hours and hours. We weren't even getting close, right? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2046.56s)]
*  So finally I look back to him and I go mark, you know, like how many crocs have you caught dude? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2049.12s)]
*  He's like and he's been there over a year. He's a biologist. I mean crocodile biology. He's like well [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2053.8399999999997s)]
*  I've never caught one. I'm like what here we are with the film crew [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2058.4s)]
*  We haven't caught one like we're screwed, right? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2061.88s)]
*  And so we had we had a half a day the next day [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2064.36s)]
*  So I spent the night like sleepless right like what am I gonna do about this man? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2067.04s)]
*  You know and I kind of devised a plan and literally we went out the next morning and within an hour [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2070.8s)]
*  We had like a 15 foot bull crocodile giant crocodile [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2075.6s)]
*  But my point is is that now you're pulling them on land when you jump that thing, right? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2079.6s)]
*  You got to jump them tape them and stuff like that says that a 15 foot bull crocodile, let's put a bull crocodile [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2083.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah crocodile. Yeah right there. I mean, there we go. Is that it? Yeah, there you go, man. That's right there [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2087.8599999999997s)]
*  They're giant, you know [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2093.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a male crocodile, you know [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2096.2799999999997s)]
*  So the bull crocodile the male crocodile is gonna be one of your bigger crocodiles in that in the in the area and they're all [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2098.24s)]
*  Hierarchy, right? The biggest one is the bull because he's like hey, I've got this damn don't come around me [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2104.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm gonna I got all the women I want you can't have you a minimum of those spins [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2109.52s)]
*  Can you pull it up please? So that's one of them right there? Yeah, I mean, this is the size of that's actually smaller [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2112.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no, nothing man. We just literally we knew some get them on land and then that's what I'm saying [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2118.3s)]
*  No hesitation, right? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2124.98s)]
*  You have to jump it you have to jump on top of it and get that thing subdued so that someone can tape its mouth [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2126.0400000000004s)]
*  So you can do your research on it [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2132.28s)]
*  So how were you guys the one you guys were able to get you guys? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2133.96s)]
*  What what was the difference that you guys chose to do that day? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2136.4s)]
*  So so basically what happened was there was one area on the end of the [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2139.04s)]
*  Dam that actually had some hippos on there and so the boat driver didn't want to go over there, right? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2143.36s)]
*  So what's happening is when they were just exploding the water? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2147.68s)]
*  They're just disappearing on the opposite side of the dam. It was kind of shallow for about a hundred feet [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2149.92s)]
*  So when they exploded off the the the side they'd have to run and and so I knew that if we could like [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2154.64s)]
*  Triangulate when hey, let's get to where they get to deep water now [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2161.68s)]
*  We got a chance to new some right now the boat driver really didn't want to go over there because of course hippos [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2165.16s)]
*  Oh, they'll go in your size about capsize about and kill you but I'm like, that's the only chance we have [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2170.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. And so we went out and like I said, there was a big 15 plus foot crocodile and and we that's the one right? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2175.12s)]
*  And I said and I remember a boat drivers name was Amos and I said Amos don't go towards the crocodile go where he's gonna go [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2181.36s)]
*  Right like when he's exploding that way you got to meet him at that right when he gets that water, right? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2187.64s)]
*  And we got there got the noose on him drug them across land [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2192.52s)]
*  It took six of us to drag them out onto land because he was so heavy and then I had to jump his head, right? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2195.64s)]
*  You know, so you got jump on top his head with your body. What are you wearing? I mean this right here [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2200.72s)]
*  You know, this is I'm like, I'm not no khakis. No hat just me, you know, but no hesitation you hesitate [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2204.88s)]
*  Yes, it was yeah sneakers, but man slip and fall you're done [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2212.2s)]
*  You know, but like I said you hesitate that thing's gonna take your hand off right off. You have to be quick [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2215.3s)]
*  You have to make your own move. Do you think they respect that almost a little bit more or they're just it's just surprised [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2220.04s)]
*  I think it's surprised. Yeah, I don't think they care either way, you know, I mean they you know, listen [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2224.62s)]
*  Crocodiles have one thing in mind. They're predators man. They're apex predators hundred million years on this planet, you know [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2229.36s)]
*  So so when you say an apex predator is a snake an apex predator [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2235.36s)]
*  I can be depends on where it is, you know [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2239.0s)]
*  a lot of snakes aren't apex for apex predators would just mean that they don't have a [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2241.0s)]
*  You know, there's nobody predate predates on them, right? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2244.84s)]
*  Really most apex predators crocodiles, you know the list goes on of anything that would you know lions tigers [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2247.7s)]
*  The only real predators that they have are humans really, you know, we're the only ones that can kill them [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2254.58s)]
*  I mean in the wild if humans weren't around nothing kills a big crocodile, right? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2259.62s)]
*  You know big crocodiles are really there. They don't have anything getting them not well not except for humans [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2263.42s)]
*  You know anymore. Yeah, not anymore and now down in the Everglades [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2269.54s)]
*  You've got the Burmese pythons that are eating alligators, which you know, those are both apex predators [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2272.8199999999997s)]
*  You know in Asia Burmese pythons 20 foot, you know 18 20 foot pythons [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2277.18s)]
*  They're the apex predators once they hit adulthood, you know, nothing's killing those guys [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2280.98s)]
*  But now you've got two of them down in Florida fighting for the same land, you know [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2284.96s)]
*  And where are these two located at do they know? Oh, yeah, they're down in the Everglades [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2289.0s)]
*  You know, so how many are there a lot of Burmese pythons alive on the planet? Yeah [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2294.06s)]
*  Well just in in Florida alone there there's estimates of a couple hundred thousand [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2298.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah and those are those are not supposed to be there man, they're not [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2303.06s)]
*  Well, I'm listen I'm gonna I'm gonna go the other way we're to talk about how awesome snakes are right [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2311.94s)]
*  Yeah, we can I didn't come here to scare you [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2318.1s)]
*  I just think it's I'm even an example of what I'm saying what I was thinking about earlier. It's like [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2322.58s)]
*  It's like you have all this pin [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2328.6s)]
*  I remember the first snake I ever saw was walking with my grandparents and my grandmother hated me and this frickin [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2330.04s)]
*  Snake what next you know wrapped around my boot and I was so scared [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2336.7599999999998s)]
*  They're like don't move and my grandmother was like beating me in the leg with this shovel and I'm like what is happening? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2340.8599999999997s)]
*  I couldn't even see the snake. I didn't know what was going on. I knew my grandmother didn't like me [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2346.16s)]
*  So I'm just like this I knew you know, I didn't think it was gonna go down like this [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2350.68s)]
*  We're in the woods. I'm saying I thought we're going fishing and now I'm thinking that they're trying to take me [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2354.16s)]
*  I'm like, you know, and then it's a black snake wrapped around my [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2357.7999999999997s)]
*  wrapped around my boot and then I remember being a kid swimming in the [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2361.96s)]
*  like the chaffa liar bogafla or something and [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2367.44s)]
*  My friend Robert and he had he was like haunted or something [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2371.08s)]
*  He had some kind of issue where he would say stuff and then like he would repeat everything [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2374.42s)]
*  He would say over real quietly under his breath. He'd like it's lunchtime [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2378.72s)]
*  And he did it for everything, you know, so I think he's supposed to be twins or something, you know [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2382.72s)]
*  I don't know what happened to him. But [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2388.7599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, he and I are out there playing right and he and we just see this on top of the water just [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2390.3999999999996s)]
*  And we're just I mean it just so much every time it was always fear [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2396.3599999999997s)]
*  I think I never knew anybody who introduced me to a snake as a hey, this is a safe thing around [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2401.2799999999997s)]
*  This is a safe thing. Yeah, so it was always a lot of fear in the environment of snakes [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2407.24s)]
*  So I think that's what I think I am as an example of people show up with to you with all that shit like hey [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2411.98s)]
*  You did it. Yeah, you know you did it Brian [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2417.98s)]
*  You know like you put those snakes in my childhood you asshole [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2421.7s)]
*  Yeah, like I think there's a lot of that because it's such a fear thing for a lot of people or for me anyway [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2425.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know what the opposite of fear is is knowledge, right? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2431.02s)]
*  So the more you know the less you fear right? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2434.86s)]
*  So, you know when your grandma was beating you all you thought of is bad snake, right? Yeah [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2437.02s)]
*  Not bad grandma, but bad snake [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2441.42s)]
*  Yeah, I probably thought a little bit of both about my grandma. My grandmother was really she was a real she was out there [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2443.82s)]
*  But but yeah, I think yeah you blow. Yeah a lot of stuff gets. Yeah, it's just such a fear thing [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2448.3s)]

*  Sadie Hawkins or something. You gotta wear the same shirt, right? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2467.82s)]
*  Yeah, and my buddy ended up touching this girl's crotch like the first time ever in our childhood [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2470.34s)]
*  And I don't know if it's appropriate. I know your son's in here, but yeah [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2476.6600000000003s)]

*  but um, and my buddy's dad comes out there by the fire and is like [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2486.3s)]
*  Spends the whole night like like basically massaging my buddy's hand that he touched the girls crotch with like real dark stuff going on [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2491.98s)]
*  So anyway that night we have to sleep at my buddy's house, right and he had like 15 snakes in his room [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2500.42s)]
*  Wow in cages and dude, I'd never I'd never knowingly slept within [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2505.34s)]
*  Probably almost 50 miles of a snake cuz that's where the zoo was closest to us [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2511.3s)]
*  And I remember he turned this I'm laying there. We're off to sleep in his bed [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2514.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm laying there and he turns the ceiling fan and he had the fastest ceiling fan I've ever heard in my life [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2519.82s)]
*  So suddenly every snake I feel like is just wide awake every snake smell is just [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2525.82s)]
*  Swirling in the room and I'm just laying there in this cauldron of just like hopelessness, you know [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2531.7400000000002s)]
*  it had just been such an insane night and [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2537.3s)]
*  And then my friend's dog barked outside the dad went out shot the dog in the head, right? Mr. Joe [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2540.26s)]
*  But anyway, uh, but anyway, so that was just another scary night where I'm surrounded by snakes, you know, so [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2547.54s)]
*  Yeah, I've just had a lot of trauma with snakes man, um PTSD [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2553.26s)]
*  Now you got a snake showing up in your living room or whatever, you know, yeah I do man [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2558.34s)]
*  We got a question that came in right here actually from a gentleman. I think what is this? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2562.06s)]
*  Hey, what's up, Brian? What's up Theo? Um [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2567.34s)]
*  My name is Gio. Nice to meet you. I got a question for Brian regarding reptiles snakes things of that nature [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2570.78s)]
*  nature itself, um [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2579.54s)]
*  You feel like they're what what's like the biggest misconception you feel that [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2582.02s)]
*  most people have about snakes venomous or non venomous and [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2587.58s)]
*  Or reptiles and in general that you feel like you'd like to squash right now [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2592.58s)]
*  you just you just want to set the record straight for the world the US and other places and [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2597.98s)]
*  Theo not to make things a little awkward [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2603.58s)]
*  But do you think that Brian is in cahoots with Bobby Lee and that's how you got that snake [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2606.5s)]
*  I say you got that little snake in you in your hotel you posted on your story. Yeah [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2612.06s)]
*  It's a thought not to make it awkward or whatever, but [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2617.58s)]
*  Just think think about it [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2620.98s)]
*  All right. Thank you for your service. Mr. Gonzalez. That's a good question [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2622.82s)]
*  That's two good questions. Let's start with the first one. What is a misconception man? Cuz I feel misconceived [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2626.58s)]
*  Totally yeah that they're killers, you know that they're there, you know [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2631.7000000000003s)]
*  Like just cold-blooded killers that all they want to do they're put here to hurt you, you know, which is just not the case [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2634.34s)]
*  You know, it's never you. Why do you think a rattlesnake has a rattle to tell you to stay away from it? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2639.98s)]
*  Right. It's I want to bite you. Yeah, you know, so that's a huge misconception that snakes are just heartless [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2645.06s)]
*  Killers and that they're here to hurt you. What are they here to do? They're here [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2650.3s)]
*  Really? They're here to be part of the ecosystem, right? So, you know, like think about a farmer, right? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2653.82s)]
*  You know farmer that has you know mice like grain, right? So now there's mice in the fields [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2658.66s)]
*  Well, those snakes are there to kill the mice to save your grain, right? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2664.2999999999997s)]
*  You know that's happened before we're like, you know [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2667.7s)]
*  Maybe a kid gets bit in the town by a rattlesnake then they go and they kill all the rattlesnakes all then they lose their crop to [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2669.94s)]
*  Infantage infestation of rodents, right? I see so it's a real equalizer [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2676.3399999999997s)]
*  it is it's if they're here to equalize everything a huge huge huge part of the ecosystem and [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2680.46s)]
*  One that if you take it away, you're in big trouble really? Yeah big trouble [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2685.54s)]
*  So when why don't do snakes operate mostly at night? Are they nighttime workers? They can be both, you know [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2689.52s)]
*  They can be both [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2694.94s)]
*  So basically how you would tell a nocturnal animal from a diurnal animal daytime nighttime is round pupils [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2695.44s)]
*  daytime [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2702.54s)]
*  Slits like cat eyes nighttime. The one you had was actually a diurnal moving around in the daytime. That's daytime daytime. Okay [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2703.74s)]
*  Um [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2711.42s)]
*  And then I don't know Bobby Lee, you know, so I I'm not gonna take any if there's one ethnicity you had to guess [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2712.34s)]
*  Let's ballpark it. Mm-hmm. And let's say Asian. Mm-hmm [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2718.38s)]
*  That would send someone a snake what what ethnicity is most associated with snakes throughout the history of time? Oh my goodness [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2722.2200000000003s)]
*  That's great. You know, I that's wow, you know, like obviously ancient Egyptians were really into it [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2730.1s)]
*  Indians I mean, you know you have in India you have people [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2735.98s)]
*  You know kids that are raised to be snake people from the time their infants, you know, like around snakes [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2739.52s)]
*  They're they're some of the most adept snake people. Yeah, I think those two cultures are really really, you know, Japan again [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2745.62s)]
*  They worship a lot of snakes. They have temples snake temples. Yeah, so I think all those things, you know, and then [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2751.64s)]
*  Yeah, so I think probably [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2757.84s)]
*  Egyptian [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2759.92s)]
*  Indian Japanese would be my two or my three top ones [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2761.12s)]
*  Egyptian Indian Japanese Bobby Lee [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2765.36s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. Yeah, very interesting [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2768.04s)]
*  Well, he admitted to sending me the snake. So that's the crazy part [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2771.52s)]
*  Did he admit? Yeah, he has an episode of his podcast coming out in like a couple days that he admitted to sending me the snake [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2774.2400000000002s)]
*  He sent it, huh? So it's just insane. I feel like and how do you even get a snake through the mail? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2779.0s)]
*  Can you mail a snake to someone? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2784.36s)]
*  What are the legal US Postal System rules about a snake or FedEx can't mail it but you can FedEx it [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2786.1600000000003s)]
*  So I could set it FedEx to your door, but you can't mail it [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2793.12s)]
*  Yes, I think why is the mail or the postal people are they more afraid of it? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2796.96s)]
*  Or what is the deal? It's just where it's just a rule that they have [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2800.44s)]
*  I think that if I'm not mistaken and I could be wrong about it [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2803.0s)]
*  But I think you can ship frogs weirdly enough, you know through the mail, but you can't do reptiles [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2805.7999999999997s)]
*  But but FedEx ups, you know chance off you're flying on a plane [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2811.56s)]
*  There's a reptile in that the belly of that plane [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2816.04s)]
*  Yeah, or tarantulas there's probably just think about that next time you're sitting up there having a cocktail [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2818.86s)]
*  Okay, I mean I respect you for want me to but I just I don't know if that's gonna help me man [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2825.9s)]
*  It's been hard for me to sleep since I saw that snake in my house. Really? Yeah [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2831.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we got to work on you that man. We got to get you over it. Yeah, I do need to man [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=2834.18s)]

*  You know, there's nowhere in the room that you can't get bit when that snake is around, you know [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3087.72s)]
*  I mean, it's got that strike range [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3091.96s)]
*  So so there's literally people that that's what they do for a living is just remove snakes and protect people [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3093.16s)]
*  But in this country, we don't have that problem [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3097.92s)]
*  In this country, can you die from a snake bite? It's pretty rare. I mean anyone can die, you know, you've got diamond backs [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3100.64s)]
*  You've got you know, quit, you know pygmy rattlesnakes [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3107.56s)]
*  You've got you know, lots of rattlesnakes mainly in this country also have coral snakes [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3110.88s)]
*  But actual death rate in this country is pretty low because of treatment, right? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3115.08s)]
*  If you get bit you get to a hospital you get treatment it's not gonna be pretty [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3119.7000000000003s)]
*  You know depending on how bad the bite is but but you're gonna you're gonna live, you know [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3122.82s)]
*  Or and yeah, it was is any person more likely to get bit by a snake? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3127.62s)]
*  like if you're wearing jewelry if you are Caucasian if you are [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3131.58s)]
*  Russian if you are [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3137.42s)]
*  Mexican if you are black if you are [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3141.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, if you are [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3143.42s)]
*  Wearing like a costume or something is there anybody more likely to get bit? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3145.42s)]
*  I would say the most likely person to get bit really the most most likely is someone that keeps him as a pet [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3149.46s)]
*  Second would be someone that's drinking comes across a rattlesnake in the wild and wants to cowboy it and like look at me [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3156.3s)]
*  I could get the rattlesnake, you know, they've seen Steve Irwin [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3162.7400000000002s)]
*  Whatever the case is down the road and they're like I'm gonna do this [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3165.58s)]
*  That is a bug of some sort. Okay. Yeah, that's not a reptile [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3168.38s)]
*  Yeah, that now that I'd be more afraid of than a reptile. Oh, yeah, we got that in here. Yeah [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3173.46s)]
*  But uh, yeah, those are you know, usually alcohol has a lot to do with the getting people getting bit [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3179.34s)]
*  Yeah alcohol a lot of times, you know, there's no real ethnicity or skin tone or anything [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3184.42s)]
*  Do you notice that Native Americans have good relationships with snakes? Uh, I wouldn't say so I have have my family as Native American [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3188.14s)]
*  Oh really like it. They like them, you know, but uh, I wouldn't say they're any better or worse off for it [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3195.3s)]
*  At least the ones in my family, but they do fine [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3200.7799999999997s)]
*  Wow, that's interesting because I would feel like they would have a whole different like [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3203.9399999999996s)]
*  Just a different history with them, you know, because they have more experience probably being around them. Yeah, I think that's another thing [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3208.22s)]
*  We're just so not innate or not in that as much nature as we used to be right, you know [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3214.3399999999997s)]
*  And so we see less snakes. Um, no, that's true. Especially in California for long time. So we never saw a snake there [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3218.14s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I never saw any snakes in California unless it was already had one [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3223.7799999999997s)]
*  That was about it [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you get out in the deserts and around LA and there there's a lot of rattlesnakes, you know [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3230.08s)]
*  I mean it's not far away from the city to trust me [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3234.68s)]
*  I mean you you're right outside the city and you're getting rattlesnakes and gopher snakes. I mean, it's there's a lot out there [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3238.08s)]
*  I've caught a bunch of snakes out in California in the LA area [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3243.72s)]
*  So you're growing up you got the fat you got the bit you got the money you got the money from selling the snakes [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3246.8399999999997s)]
*  What size snakes you selling big babies? Well selling eggs. What do you do? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3251.56s)]
*  I used to sell babies, you know, that's how I started, you know [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3255.52s)]
*  And it was I sold babies of snakes that were gonna get 18 foot [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3258.6s)]
*  I sold babies of snakes that were gonna get five foot, you know now I don't do big snakes [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3262.2400000000002s)]
*  I we do still breed some stuff, but mainly I'm education zoo film stuff like that [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3266.6s)]
*  You know, I'm not into the big breeder world like I used to be but uh [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3271.8s)]
*  But that's how I came up because that was the only way listen, you know, I just wanted to work with reptiles [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3275.56s)]
*  I didn't know you know and breeding reptiles was the best way for me to do it, right? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3280.3s)]
*  I could get a job at the zoo, but there's not much money there and there's not many openings, you know [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3284.02s)]
*  So so yeah, so I worked with reptiles [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3288.82s)]
*  I bred reptiles because that was the the way I could you know, it's the labor of love, you know [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3291.02s)]
*  What's the funnest reptile to breed? Oh my gosh [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3295.26s)]
*  I think you know like live bearer ones, you know, cuz you know snakes can have eggs and they can have live right and when you just [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3298.1s)]
*  Like wait, really? Yeah, like rattlesnakes have live right so they just have a baby come right out [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3304.58s)]
*  I just boom we're live. It's a matter of crazy story [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3308.94s)]
*  Just recently I had what I thought was a pair of anacondas [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3311.18s)]
*  I have a giant female anaconda like I'm talking like, you know 125 pound anaconda and then I had now males [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3314.5s)]
*  Or there's there what they call sexually dimorphic. So males are smaller. So I was sold this animal's male [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3320.46s)]
*  My mistake didn't sex it and so I'm like, yeah, they're not breeding. That's kind of weird [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3324.62s)]
*  This is literally like a month month and a half ago in one day [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3328.66s)]
*  I come in and the male is now that's never been in with a male by the way [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3331.62s)]
*  This is these two animals have been together that's it has a virgin baby [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3336.42s)]
*  It's by itself by itself because they have both [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3341.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's no it didn't have both genitalia. It's what they call parthenogenesis. So it's only a female [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3344.82s)]
*  It's like a virgin birth no sperm no anything and it's actually a clone of its itself [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3350.9s)]
*  Yeah, so my male turned into a female and had a virgin birth [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3355.7400000000002s)]
*  So do they use that type of information to try and learn more about human cloning and stuff like I mean that seems like a real [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3359.5s)]
*  They should I don't think I don't know if they are [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3366.38s)]
*  I mean, maybe someone out there is I don't know no one ever contacted me to say hey [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3368.5s)]
*  Can we do some research on it would be cool though? I'd love to see it [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3372.42s)]
*  But but yeah, I mean genetically there is no male, you know, there's only one side and there's actually there are reptile species [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3375.1400000000003s)]
*  Like morning geckos a little lizard, right? Oh, yeah have no males in the entire species. They're all everyone's females [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3380.46s)]
*  They is that crazy? I mean it's so and they produce like so parthenogenesis in [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3386.86s)]
*  Let's say an anaconda is rare like very rare like there's probably only been a handful of recorded cases ever [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3392.02s)]
*  But then there's morning geckos that that's all they have is parthenogenesis [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3396.94s)]
*  But I say my going back to your point is live babies are always the funnest [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3400.62s)]
*  So that's really the power in nature. I mean nature when the when [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3404.98s)]
*  When put up against the wall can just make its own self. Yeah. Yeah, it's like the Jurassic Park thing [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3409.8199999999997s)]
*  Right nature finds a way can other animals do that too. I [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3415.8599999999997s)]
*  Don't think mammals there's ever been a parthenogenic mammal. Can you look at it? Yeah. Yes. Yeah parthenogenesis mammal [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3420.18s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus. Yeah, Jesus. Yeah. Jesus is the first snake [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3426.74s)]
*  Man, huh, you said it not me. I mean, I never felt his skin, but I would he doesn't seem like it. Yeah [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3433.3399999999997s)]
*  What do we say here? There are? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3440.14s)]
*  known cases of [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3442.66s)]
*  naturally occurring [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3445.2599999999998s)]
*  Mammal a mammalian parthenogenesis in the world in the wild [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3446.7s)]
*  So it didn't have any of mammals what does progeny mean by offspring [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3452.2999999999997s)]
*  Right parthenogenic offspring of mammals would have two X chromosomes and would therefore be female in 1935 George [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3456.2599999999998s)]
*  successfully [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3464.18s)]
*  Wow into a rabbit reported successfully inducing parthenogenesis in a rabbit Wow, I wonder how he would induce parthenogenesis in a rabbit [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3466.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how that goes. That's wild. I mean that guy I'd like to have a beer with that guy [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3475.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to frickin make sure his daughter's. Okay. Yeah [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3480.16s)]
*  Damn, that's intense man. Wow [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3484.8399999999997s)]
*  So that's what one thing that baffles me a lot man is just the ability of nature [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3487.4s)]
*  You know, especially we get so like city fight and comfortable and like so used to like human accoutrements and stuff [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3491.48s)]
*  Now we forget sometimes how much of nature we are yeah, at least I do anyway, yeah, I love getting out man [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3499.1200000000003s)]
*  You got to get away and especially when you're in the bush for a while like you get out, you know [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3505.04s)]
*  Like just totally away from everything. It's amazing how quick you adapt [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3509.6800000000003s)]
*  Right the first couple days when you're away from everything like cell phones and internet and TV and stuff like that [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3512.52s)]
*  It's a little bit weird, right because we're so used to that like oh check Instagram, you know, and a couple days [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3518.92s)]
*  It's a little weird, but then all of a sudden you just kind of forget about it, you know [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3524.8s)]
*  And it's it's wild how quickly you can acclimate into a situation because there's been times where I've been out for [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3527.58s)]
*  3040 days, you know where there's like nothing, you know, I mean you're just in the bush, you know work [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3533.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's actually amazing and then when you come back to reality, it feels really weird [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3537.98s)]
*  You know, I mean like, you know, you turn on the TV. It's almost like us over senseless, you know, like oh, that's that's bizarre [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3543.94s)]
*  It feels almost bad. Yeah, it does. It really does [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3549.58s)]
*  You know, I mean I look at my screen time on my phone all the time [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3552.18s)]
*  I'm like damn I spent two hours on my phone today [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3554.66s)]
*  You know, yeah, just this week man. I'm trying to really back off [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3557.1s)]
*  I'm trying to really really back off make things less important if I can [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3561.22s)]
*  Here's a question right here from a young man. That seems rather interesting [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3566.3399999999997s)]
*  Brian Theo, what's up boys? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3570.94s)]
*  Stoked to see Brian on the podcast boys been a big fan of you know reptiles and all things [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3574.7799999999997s)]
*  Wild if you will [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3581.02s)]
*  Guess my questions for Brian what your thoughts on the existence of a giant anaconda still being out there [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3584.02s)]
*  Lurking in the depths of the Amazon or Venezuela or wherever those things would be [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3590.34s)]

*  $50,000 for anyone that could come up with a snake over 30 foot live or dead [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3620.9s)]
*  right way back then and and then it ultimately ended up I think getting raised to like [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3624.94s)]
*  $75,000 until the 90s when they discontinued the the grant and then recently I even put out something saying I'd give someone a hundred grand [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3631.18s)]
*  They came up with a 30 foot snake [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3639.02s)]
*  I would prefer live instead of dead but uh, and no one's ever claimed that prize [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3640.82s)]
*  So so is there a snake out there in Venezuela by the way, he had a cool shirt on [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=3644.66s)]

*  I'm sure there's a lot of crossover. I'm sure there is yeah, you know [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4168.099999999999s)]
*  I find it interesting on your partner with people like [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4171.379999999999s)]
*  You know, I would say for know who is here by the way good to see you Noah [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4176.46s)]
*  I [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4184.299999999999s)]
*  Would say I even think in the beginning dude, I used to tell Jim Gaffigan's jokes, right? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4186.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I told this is Jim Gaffigan why he was on what time I said look did I just want to apologize to you [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4193.38s)]
*  I didn't have any jokes in the beginning. I just need to tell your jokes [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4198.58s)]
*  Yeah, I told a couple of yeah, yeah, it was good [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4203.58s)]
*  I think I even sold t-shirts based on one of his jokes one time [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4206.3s)]
*  So I would tell the joke and then sell his shirt after the show [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4209.86s)]
*  Yeah, but what it did for me was it just got me used to telling jokes on stage [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4212.72s)]
*  I had plans to tell my own jokes and I had some of my own jokes peppered in there. Yeah [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4217.78s)]
*  But it just got me comfortable [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4224.179999999999s)]
*  Telling jokes sure so it was like it wasn't anything that was being recorded or anything like that [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4226.98s)]
*  So it just got me like how do I learn to get whatever some of this comfort is sure and then I think one [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4232.62s)]
*  Benefit that Noah probably has is that your dad is a unique character, right? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4241.0199999999995s)]
*  My dad was a unique character my dad was 70 when I was born everybody knows that so like it just gave me a lot [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4245.62s)]
*  Of material it was like, you know, it gave me a lot of like cute kind of little jokes that were safe that were pretty clean [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4252.06s)]
*  Yeah, that I could tell about my dad, you know [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4258.1s)]
*  And so I think I've always felt like that was kind of a blessing like I was always angry that my dad not angry [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4261.22s)]
*  But it was always felt odd, you know kids always want to be just the regular kids always want to be like sure [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4268.42s)]
*  You know nothing that stands out real crazy. Sure, you know your dad comes to show and tell he's the fucking guy out there [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4273.74s)]
*  He was doing magic or something. You know, I'm saying that kid [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4279.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably gonna get beaten down, right? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4281.98s)]
*  But it's like so I think if your dad comes and your dad comes to show and tell and he's like I was born in [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4284.66s)]
*  1910, you know, that's a weird time for the class. Yes [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4290.179999999999s)]
*  So I think it could there's just a lot of unique material when your dad is unique like you are [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4294.9s)]
*  So I think that that's I would play on just easy stuff in the beginning, yeah [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4299.94s)]
*  So those are things that I think are just probably gifts that are in your wheelhouse. Yeah. Yeah when you come from a fan [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4305.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of stories, right? I mean, you know, my mom and dad are you know, have a reptile zoo [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4310.86s)]

*  There's a lot of material there. Yeah, it's a weird. It's a weird life, right? You know, I say that all the time [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4321.34s)]
*  I mean like I've lived a shoe the craziest life ever, you know, it's the weirdest thing like I literally clean snake shit for a living [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4326.58s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's like it's the weirdest thing but yet I get to do the most amazing things on the planet [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4334.5s)]
*  You know, it's like, you know, most people look at me and like how did this happen? I'm like, I don't even know how it happened [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4339.5s)]
*  You know, I don't even know how I got here. Yeah, I'm sitting in Theo Vans [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4344.42s)]
*  Podcast room here. You know, it's crazy, right? Yeah, it is. I mean, it's definitely interesting [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4348.5s)]
*  You know, I'm trying to think of some more and more of my curiosities about snakes so snakes [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4353.18s)]
*  Why do snakes eat rats and stuff like that? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4359.86s)]
*  Well, most most of them eat rats or rabbits or pigs or whatever the case may be it they're just carnivores, right? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4362.62s)]
*  You know, but there are snakes that eat really weird thing like snails [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4368.3s)]
*  Some would eat worms some will only slugs other snakes eat only other snake or mainly other snakes like king cobras [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4371.7s)]
*  Eat mainly other snakes, you know in the wild so so they're a very diverse animal, right? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4378.9s)]
*  You know, but in captivity most you know, most snakes that that people keep are mice and rats, you know [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4383.5s)]
*  Do snakes ever do anything fun together you think no now I don't think so. They're pretty solitary animals [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4389.7s)]
*  We keep most of our snakes separate and except for breeding. I think they just want to be left alone [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4394.9s)]
*  You know, I think they're not like a real social animal [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4399.42s)]
*  Although there's like the Narcissus snake dens if you want to pull that up, it's pretty cool [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4402.94s)]
*  Narcissus snake den up in Manitoba, Canada, it's crazy. It's the place you would love to go [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4406.98s)]
*  I'm sure it was and is it outdoors or it's in indoors? It's outdoors and so it's a natural occurring naturally occurring snake [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4411.76s)]
*  Then that is this is your nightmare right here, dude. Oh, I mean thousands and thousands of snakes gather together [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4418.24s)]
*  Yeah, thousands and thousands of snakes, but but it's crazy. I mean, it's like [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4424.98s)]
*  It's a super popular tourism place [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4429.139999999999s)]
*  You know people go and see these thousands of snakes that have have den together for hibernation or brumation is what they would call it [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4431.16s)]
*  And pretty crazy, right? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4437.04s)]
*  I've never been I want to go I want to go so bad, you know, I've never seen anything like it [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4439.599999999999s)]
*  But I want to check it out. It's like Burning Man. Yeah Burning Man for snakes, right? Exactly. It's like berm [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4444.28s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4450.36s)]
*  Burning man and how much snakes are there and what are that? Why are they there again? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4451.84s)]
*  Well, they're just brumating [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4455.5599999999995s)]
*  So so a lot of times in particular species like garter snakes will brumate together [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4456.8s)]
*  So they're mating they're not even mating. No, they're just like going to sleep for like a hibernation proof [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4462.08s)]
*  Oh, so they sleep in a group [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4466.84s)]
*  Yep [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4467.84s)]
*  they just sleep in a group and then they wake up and then when they wake up they then they get into breeding and [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4468.16s)]
*  You'll have like breeding modes and stuff like that. And then yeah, I mean that's it's pretty much it [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4472.68s)]
*  You know, and then then they'll go on their own way, you know during the summer months [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4477.52s)]
*  They're not together at all have a snake ever eaten an animal and then the animal [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4481.06s)]
*  Lived and cut open the snake and got out [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I don't know of any that have lived but there have been like there's actually a famous picture [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4489.0s)]

*  Right. Yeah, you could be a snake who knows man [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4537.12s)]

*  But I don't care about it that much with was there a lot of sacrifice because if you did so much stuff [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4783.76s)]
*  It seems like with the animals was it hard to like run a family and have that at the same time or was things pretty? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4788.4400000000005s)]

*  So tons of sacrifice you know I mean you know running businesses are sacrificed [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4817.08s)]
*  Yeah, a live animal business is even a giant sacrifice [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4821.56s)]
*  You know because you're always and then you on my end I because I film every day you know for my vlog [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4825.400000000001s)]

*  Have you ever got a crazy call somebody hit a snake or the cops or need a snake or something a man been hiding a snake [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4835.32s)]

*  Yeah, yeah [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4845.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean I've been called into is my freak the real estate agent just two days ago called me and said that there was a [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4846.24s)]
*  Snake in a house she was renting some military what happened to you and said you come on get this snake [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4852.36s)]
*  I don't know what to do so we get calls like that or like the local authorities will call us if they you know [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4857.2s)]
*  Maybe someone moved out of a house and left snakes behind or reptiles behind or or stuff like that [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4862.1s)]
*  We so we will do that you know it's not something that I you know it's part of my life or something like that [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4867.200000000001s)]
*  But I'm happy to help at any point. I can you know it's always weird [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4872.06s)]
*  I'll put out about probably 20 pounds of snake repellent this morning. That's more like cinnamon [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4875.3s)]
*  I thought a little bit so that's an interesting thing right it's like I heard you say that and and you're right [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4879.860000000001s)]
*  You know like cinnamon is one pepper is another one that people talk about [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4884.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't think any of them work to be honest with you. I think it makes you feel better, right? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4888.78s)]
*  I mean not that I'm now I'm fake making you feel worse [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4892.9s)]
*  But I'm not sure that anything breaks the thing but I if I was a betting man [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4895.22s)]
*  I think your invasion is over and you're not gonna see a snake again [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4900.66s)]
*  Is there worse setting any kind of trap inside or anything like that to see if there's more snakes in there would they come? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4904.84s)]
*  And get it like a mousetrap or something no no no not really. I think there was a guy one time made the snake [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4909.82s)]
*  Trap thing that supposedly worked so first off snakes oftentimes [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4917.54s)]
*  I want to be along a wall like they don't want to be in the middle of floor because that's dangerous, right? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4921.74s)]
*  You know danger danger. I'm in the middle of there [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4925.62s)]
*  So they'll like be along the walls right and so he actually took like a [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4927.62s)]
*  2-liter Pepsi bottle that was an opening that it could get into and put like a little mouse in there [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4932.219999999999s)]
*  And it could get into it, but then wasn't smart enough to figure out how to get out of it, you know [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4937.7s)]
*  So that was the only snake trap. I've ever seen that apparently worked [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4941.98s)]
*  But I've never tried it and and you know we don't get many snake escapes [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4945.56s)]
*  but we get the occasional snake that escapes you know from a drawer or something like that and [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4949.92s)]
*  And then we have to try to find it [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4954.92s)]
*  Probably you know I actually a 19 foot snake escape once, but that was my fault [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4957.76s)]
*  I left it every listen every time a snake's escape. It's always my fault [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4961.42s)]
*  I've always accidentally left a latch undone or a lock undone and but uh and she wasn't a happy snake either [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4965.400000000001s)]
*  So it was a lot of fun catching her have a snake ever killed its owner that you know of [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4970.88s)]
*  They have yeah, yeah, they have it's not it's not common, but it does happen [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4975.08s)]
*  I think there's been about there's probably been about five or six deaths in the United States in the last 30 years [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4978.68s)]
*  Oh, that's not that so it's not many. It's not many. It's far less than even shark attacks [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4984.72s)]
*  You know so it's pretty now. No you know again it happens [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4988.96s)]
*  You know in the wild more in in Indonesia in the Philippines [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4992.280000000001s)]
*  You know big giant reticulated pythons will take people a little bit more common again [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=4996.34s)]
*  I don't think like [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5000.92s)]
*  Multiple per year, but it does happen. I mean just maybe two two years ago [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5002.36s)]
*  I remember seeing a story of a woman went out because like her pig was squealing right and [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5006.4s)]
*  She went out to go figure out what was happening with the pig obviously there was a snake there and the next morning [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5012.72s)]
*  They found her slippers [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5017.52s)]
*  And in a giant snake with a huge lump in it, and they actually cut the snake and she was inside [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5018.84s)]
*  Oh, so yeah, she was deceased show yeah [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5023.92s)]
*  But that's it's a rare thing it like I said in the in in America [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5027.120000000001s)]
*  It's very very rare you know and again usually it's [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5030.88s)]
*  You know listen you know that's why you shouldn't handle a big snake without someone else there [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5035.280000000001s)]
*  I have never we've always had the policy got to have two people just in case and I've never been in danger my entire [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5039.080000000001s)]
*  Life never once has a snake almost killed me if a snake starts swallowing your friend. What do you do? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5045.280000000001s)]
*  What is the other about what are you supposed to do? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5050.200000000001s)]
*  So we have a policy as much as I hate to say it is that if there's ever a situation where someone's in danger you kill [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5051.88s)]
*  The snake you know immediately like I mean there's no second [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5057.68s)]
*  You know you can't you can't take the risk of trying to get that snake off if it's danger mode right because if you have a [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5061.08s)]
*  18 we have snakes that are almost 200 pounds [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5066.88s)]
*  You know if that thing is is for some reason and we've never had it happen [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5069.12s)]
*  But for some reason that is is constricting you you don't have much time [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5072.28s)]
*  I mean that's gonna. It's gonna black you out. You know you follow UFC [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5076.08s)]
*  I mean you'll put someone to sleep pretty quick right you can imagine a snake this big [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5079.0s)]
*  It's gonna put someone to sleep real quick [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5082.96s)]
*  You know once you're asleep will they then do they then let go can they tell when you're asleep? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5084.64s)]
*  They'll they'll squeeze you till you're done right you know so that kind of you're not just [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5090.24s)]
*  Yes, you can't play dead. You know you can't be like. I'll just play dead and they'll let go [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5094.92s)]
*  I mean it'll it'll it'll hang on to you for 20 30 minutes [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5098.52s)]
*  You know and and then then release so what should you do if a snake start wrapping around you? [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5101.6s)]
*  Hit it with your car keys or something not [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5106.44s)]
*  Ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent of times when a snake is wrapping around you [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5109.12s)]
*  It's holding on to like it wants like you're a tree. It's just trying not to fall. You know just trying not to fall it is [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5112.679999999999s)]
*  I've like I said I've never experienced a snake trying to kill me or anyone around me ever so I don't know what would trigger a snake [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5119.32s)]
*  Maybe it's hungry. Maybe you haven't taken care of it and haven't fed it properly. I'm not sure [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5126.92s)]
*  I don't know what would trigger a snake to try to constrict you I've never seen it [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5131.48s)]
*  So I I don't think it's I think people think it happens right and even you know when people see me have a giant [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5134.96s)]
*  Anticrown around my neck like isn't it gonna kill you you know you're like no. It's just hanging on to me, man [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5141.1s)]
*  It's like literally. I'm like a tree. You know and it's gonna wrap around you so it doesn't fall right right? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5145.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's not trying to kill you [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5151.28s)]
*  Do you uh is there another question that came in spent anything else we want to get to? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5153.4800000000005s)]
*  So my question is how do you feel about [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5159.04s)]
*  Like all the hate that you get people say you don't take every animals correct whatever like I don't watch you for a few years [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5163.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm very interesting. It's crazy taking care of a bunch of reptiles like that [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5171.84s)]
*  But just want to feel your opinion like I hate all that shit. Sorry. It's windy out here. Yeah, okay [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5175.76s)]
*  Wendy inside everywhere man. Well you know I do why do animal people get? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5182.56s)]
*  So much you don't take care of your animals why is that such a common thing in the animal world? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5185.6s)]
*  I think it's it's always I think it's not just in the animal world [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5189.92s)]
*  I think that hatred comes from success right you know just like you you have a big following I guarantee you there are people [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5193.200000000001s)]
*  Out there that think you're bad for whatever reason right and people are mean yeah [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5198.88s)]
*  And so like I can tell you this much no one that's ever visited my place has ever said [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5202.96s)]
*  I haven't taken care of an animal you know I mean it's always just the people that like are jealous or like oh my god [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5207.280000000001s)]
*  This guy's got a big following he's in and it doesn't even bother me to be honest with you because I know right I don't have to prove to anybody what the deal is right know that I mean you can't go to a place that's better kept than ours I mean the animals are impeccably kept and [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5212.8s)]
*  And we have a crew that's really great so so yeah that stuff I think that just comes with being successful you know it comes with people following you you know when you have five people that follow you online [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5226.8s)]
*  No one cares but when you have millions of people that follow you you know their voice you know that that minor that vocal minority and they you know you know I'm sure you get the same thing the most crazy things get made up about me that that's wild I'll read something I'll be like what's the word like like you know it's like he's building a Noah's ark yeah you know who knows you know I mean I hear all kinds of stuff you know it's like and he's closeted he's building a Noah's ark and you're like that's funny you know I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5236.8s)]
*  yeah yeah but I think that you know as you know in your position that you know we we signed up for this number one right no one told us to become social media or comedians or whatever we decided to do it so we have to take the good with bad the bad is loud mouse that like to you know have their 15 minutes of you know fame with the keyboard you know yeah and you have to learn how to just not worry about it it's a little bit more difficult you know with animals because because when [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5266.8s)]
*  someone hears like you're not taking care of your animals then people like oh my god he's an animal abuser whereas if someone's like you know like Theo stole the you know Jim Gaffigan's jokes when he was you're like yeah whatever it didn't matter as much so people take that more serious but again I think that's a good point yeah animal things are hot it's always such a hot topic I think especially when that Joe dirt Joe Tiger King yeah yeah did you ever run across that guy I didn't know Joe but I knew almost everyone else in the series yeah they're almost everyone else in the series with friend of mine so it was it was [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5296.8s)]
*  definitely a very as a matter of fact the scene if you remember the scene opens up at a reptile place if you remember and so he's at a reptile place guy named Tom Crutchfield and then all of a sudden there's a van Mark McCarthy a buddy of mine and there's a snow leopard in it and he says wow this took me on a completely different direction that series was originally supposed to be a reptile series it turned into a tiger series because he just happened to be at my friend Tom Crutchfield's place which by the way they've now filmed that reptile King I don't [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5326.8s)]
*  know it's called I think it's gonna be called lizard King to be honest because there was a book called lizard King from Brian Christie was a bestseller and the guy named Ray and Mike Venostrum were the lizard Kings in their reptile people but Tom Crutchfield also was one of the main guys that's how that whole thing started was it was supposed to be shot about Raven Ostrom Mike Venostrum Tom Crutchfield and a couple other guys and it turned into Tiger King but uh but yeah I knew like I'm friends with Mario the the guy that scar faces you know I don't know yeah the guy [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5356.8s)]
*  he's literally the scar face was made after him I've known Mario for a long time pretty much all the guys in the in the series I've been friends with you know the Myrtle Beach Doc Antle Doc Antle's wild yeah he seems interesting interesting is a word for that whole thing I mean listen I don't know how they make it work man you know like like but they do like I see what they do with these animals and I'm like I don't know how people aren't dying you know but they they got it oh I don't know his son isn't dead every day and he's out there eating damn mangoes with a damn [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5386.8s)]
*  you know snowcat or whatever yeah no I mean but it works man I mean they they somehow have those animals dialed in and it's you know like I don't know man I mean I give them a lot of respect from the standpoint that they really know their stuff because no one's ever been hurt there and they are you're walking around with a liger that's 800 pounds or whatever you know it's like that's crazy I gotta go over there you should man just see I'm supposed to go to Charleston a couple weeks maybe I'll try to stop on the way let me know I'll hook it up and that'd be a great idea [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5416.8s)]
*  is it hard to support like does your wife and children have other interests are you so reptile in that it's ever like hard to like because I find it hard in my own life I get so caught up in my own stuff that it's like man I've created so many things that are busy it's hard for me to put them down and recognize other people's interests and stuff and it's not a judgment it's just a curiosity no I know I think you're 100% right I think that you know if you're doing things the way I mean this is a go back to the balance thing I am so unbalanced dude you're [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5446.8s)]
*  right you know I mean like I work like I work like way too much I mean you know it's hard to have other interests at all you know I mean like like I'd love to go out and play hockey or play baseball or something like that on the weekends that just ain't gonna happen you know I'm too busy and it's the same thing my wife is you know she's 24 7 you know with me so we try we're trying you know I mean but it's it's hard because you've done everything you can do I feel like yeah well that's just I'd be a damn snake right [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5476.8s)]
*  well this is the thing that's great about my life and same thing with yours is that I'm doing all this crazy work but in the meantime I'm like you know on a freaking island in the middle of Indonesia you know in a cave with with snakes you know or or I'm traveling around or even even you know like again you know just like the first time I met you you know I'm going to a comedy show and then going back and meeting Theo von you know that's what everything is when I go to a baseball game I'm meeting the baseball players on you know it's so so like you know so you might work your your butt off [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5506.8s)]
*  but at the same time you're with your your your winning because you're living an extraordinary life yeah you know even though you're working like a dog you're like doing things that people can only dream you could do sitting in a room talking with the old bond for two hours or whatever you know it's like it's it's a blessing but yeah there's not a lot of balance man like you know I'm not sitting around playing bocce ball very much that's for sure yeah it's tough man it is interesting and I don't know if it goes back to something inside of me that wants to work all the time if it goes back to a fear of being like not [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5536.8s)]
*  seen or something I don't know do you know what made you what drove what drives you if you ever thought back on it yeah 100% it's you know the typical you know parents never thought you had to mount to anything you're never going to be good enough you're never going to be the you know your brother and sister going to be more successful and then you have that chip you know you're like you're proof I tell people all the time I've been I've been trying to you know prove to my my dad that died ten years ago how good I am you know yeah and that's what it is right I mean it's you know I listen I've got a lot of pathologies right you know and I know them all I've [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5566.8s)]
*  been through therapy plenty you know so I get it you know I'm driven because of things that happened to me when I was young but but at the same thing you know like I've said it's like I'd rather be driven to do something great yeah then be driven to do something wrong you know I mean I could have that fork was in the road when I was 16 17 years old that tongue split at the end yeah I could have went the other way and I could have been doing bad things my whole life you know I tell people all the time I'm a I'm an addict up the you know more than an addict you can imagine I just choose my addictions to be positive addictions [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5596.8s)]
*  and not drugs and alcohol and and bad stuff right hmm interesting I got one last question do you are when you travel around the world and you go to these different cultures and stuff is there a culture that you feel like that is most closest to nature that you get like a sense like man these people are right are so much closer on the cusp of of nature than maybe US culture or of our culture well for me it's always been the continent [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5626.8s)]
*  of Africa you know I mean like you know Africans are more in tune with animals for sure wow now you know see Australia it embraces animals but Australia you've been I'm sure yeah yeah I mean they're very it's like America with an accent you know really but they but you also when you go to the store there's a gummy snakes and there's you know there's koala bears everywhere and you know I mean they're very and they embrace nature yeah and those animal little sanctuaries and zoos all over you pull off any yeah you pull off at a damn truck stop [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5656.8s)]
*  and there's somebody in there taking on uh yeah koala koala a little uh no cheer whatever that little animal is waka awak here a little what is it called that smiling animal that's a walk walk yeah yeah yeah so yeah right on my arm but so but but I think the Africans are you know the Australians embrace wildlife they still live in homes and stuff that Africa especially if you get into the bush I mean those people I mean it's a way of life I mean they're [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5686.8s)]
*  they've got lions and they've got leopards [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5716.8s)]
*  and they've got rhinos and elephants living amongst them. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5720.66s)]
*  And it's a, I love being in the bush in Africa. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5724.02s)]
*  That's like the probably purest places [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5727.900000000001s)]
*  I've ever been in my entire life. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5729.88s)]
*  And the people there are, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5732.52s)]
*  I went to a place called Daktari school for, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5734.5s)]
*  bush school for kids. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5737.72s)]
*  And they would take these kids from the bush [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5739.06s)]
*  and bring them into this little camp for two weeks. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5743.18s)]
*  And the first thing they would teach them [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5745.58s)]
*  is how to flush a toilet [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5747.22s)]
*  because they had never seen running water before. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5748.34s)]
*  And I was lucky enough to come in [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5750.62s)]
*  and spend some time teaching these kids about wildlife. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5752.62s)]
*  And to them, wildlife can be scary [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5755.7s)]
*  because you wake up in the morning [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5757.92s)]
*  and your uncle Johnny got killed by a lion or whatever. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5759.62s)]
*  So everything is like- [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5764.0199999999995s)]
*  And he was the breakfast chef. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5764.86s)]
*  Right, yeah, exactly. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5766.26s)]
*  And so, but then you teach them [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5767.3s)]
*  that these animals can be respected. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5769.9s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5771.78s)]
*  I mean, and I've never been to a rural village in Africa [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5772.86s)]
*  that they aren't all smiles and aren't all like loving life [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5777.219999999999s)]
*  even though they have virtually nothing. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5780.139999999999s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think Africa is a place. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5781.98s)]
*  I mean, it's a place I always get called back to, right? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5784.88s)]
*  Like when I wanna go and just feel nature, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5787.34s)]
*  that's where you go. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5792.179999999999s)]
*  And have you been to Africa? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5793.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5794.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's a- [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5795.46s)]
*  Yeah, I've had some great experience. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5796.28s)]
*  Yeah, I would say similar. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5797.12s)]
*  You look in some people's eyes there [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5798.299999999999s)]
*  and it looks like they go so far back. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5799.62s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5801.78s)]
*  It feels like you're home when you're in Africa. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5803.42s)]
*  And that's what I always say. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5804.86s)]
*  It's like, as a matter of fact, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5805.74s)]
*  there's a great saying that says, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5806.58s)]
*  once your boot has stepped its foot in Africa, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5808.14s)]
*  you can never get the dust off. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5811.42s)]
*  And I think that that's a real true story. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5813.26s)]
*  It's like, it's always calling for you to come back. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5816.14s)]
*  And I can't wait till we can do some more traveling, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5818.42s)]
*  get back to places that I love like that. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5820.9s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5822.74s)]
*  Where do your kids like to go? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5823.58s)]
*  Well, Noah is a big traveler. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5825.22s)]
*  And my daughter is, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5828.02s)]
*  she's more like she'd go to a resort, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5831.3s)]
*  something like that. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5833.54s)]
*  She's that type of a traveler. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5834.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's fun. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5835.2s)]
*  Whereas Noah is more of an adventurous traveler. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5836.04s)]
*  I think he's been a lot of places, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5837.9s)]
*  but I think over the rest of his life, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5840.58s)]
*  he'll see the places I've seen. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5841.86s)]
*  And we've been to some pretty crazy things. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5845.1s)]
*  I mean, I've, again, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5847.14s)]
*  some of my travels have been ridiculous. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5849.04s)]
*  Probably the craziest travel thing that I ever did once [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5852.22s)]
*  was I was in Indonesia and there's this famous guy [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5855.5s)]

*  Yeah, there's Brady Barr. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5881.3s)]
*  And like I said, the most famous thing Brady ever done [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5882.14s)]
*  was get bit by a reticulated python in this thing. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5885.780000000001s)]
*  So we had, I was in Indonesia. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5887.660000000001s)]
*  I was in Indonesia and I get this, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5890.68s)]
*  literally I have a piece of loose leaf paper, dude, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5893.660000000001s)]
*  with a map drawn, a drawn map, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5896.080000000001s)]
*  how to get to the cave, right? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5898.700000000001s)]
*  Now this cave is on an island called the Bam Baju. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5900.72s)]
*  And so, and all I have is a loose leaf paper. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5903.700000000001s)]
*  Loose leaf paper literally says, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5906.38s)]
*  fly from Bali to the Bam Baju, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5907.700000000001s)]
*  drive 43 kilometers up to Astana Ular, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5910.820000000001s)]
*  hike an hour down a trail to the cave. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5915.22s)]
*  That's all I got, right? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5917.38s)]
*  So I literally pack my backpack, one change of clothes. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5918.599999999999s)]
*  I've got some camera gear. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5921.72s)]
*  It's me and a friend of mine. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5923.0599999999995s)]
*  And we get on a prop plane, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5924.5s)]
*  fly two hours off of Bali to the Bam Baju, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5925.82s)]
*  get there, a taxi driver that we had arranged [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5928.9s)]
*  in the beginning, like not taxi, but a driver, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5931.42s)]
*  like he's supposed to take us there. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5933.7s)]
*  We get there and he's like, oh no, no, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5934.8s)]
*  I'm not going to Astana Ular. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5936.18s)]
*  That's way too dangerous to get up into that. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5937.38s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5939.26s)]
*  We literally just flew here, right? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5940.099999999999s)]
*  So I, fortunately I had a friend [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5941.66s)]
*  that was real connected in Indonesia. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5942.74s)]
*  I call him up, he gets on the phone with him. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5944.18s)]
*  I don't know what he tells me, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5945.820000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he threatens him, bribes him. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5946.660000000001s)]
*  I have no idea what happened. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5948.3s)]
*  So finally he's like, all right, let's go. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5949.14s)]
*  We're doing this, you know? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5950.42s)]
*  So we drive 43 kilometers, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5951.540000000001s)]
*  takes us literally like four hours [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5953.18s)]
*  because the roads are so bad to get up there. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5954.780000000001s)]
*  Get up there, we get into this little village [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5956.900000000001s)]
*  called Astana Ular and we have to get a passage, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5959.42s)]
*  you know, from the elder, you know, the chief. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5962.820000000001s)]
*  Like if we can go to the cave, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5965.360000000001s)]
*  because this is a holy cave. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5966.780000000001s)]
*  And so literally like, you know, you get up there [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5968.14s)]
*  and they probably don't see too many white people. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5971.540000000001s)]
*  I've probably seen Brady Barr was the last white person [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5973.66s)]
*  they probably saw, right? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5975.26s)]
*  And so we, you know, all the village folk [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5976.46s)]
*  are out there laughing, they're smiling, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5979.38s)]
*  taking, you know, selfies and all this other stuff. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5981.06s)]
*  And then now we got to sit down with the elders, right? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5983.66s)]
*  We go into this dark room about this size [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5986.5s)]
*  and it's me and my friend and- [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5988.62s)]
*  Is your friend cool? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5991.14s)]
*  My friend's cool, he's from California, he's cool. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5992.1s)]
*  He's hanging out. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5994.1s)]
*  And then I've got my translator [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5994.9400000000005s)]
*  that was the guy that drove us here, right? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5996.32s)]
*  He's gonna translate for us. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5998.06s)]
*  He's sitting next to me and we go in this dark room. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=5999.54s)]
*  Three elders sitting here, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6002.48s)]
*  rest of the village behind him. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6004.24s)]
*  Now they're all stoic, not even a smile on their face, right? [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6005.5199999999995s)]
*  And 15 minutes I hear, you know, they're talking back. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6008.36s)]
*  No idea what the hell is going on. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6011.679999999999s)]
*  It's like Survivor at the end of Survivor. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6012.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, what's, and you gotta remember, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6013.839999999999s)]
*  there are still parts of Indonesia that headhunt, right? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6015.04s)]
*  So at the end of this 15 minutes, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6017.919999999999s)]
*  the end of this 15 minutes, I'm not even shitting you, man. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6019.959999999999s)]
*  I was texting my wife, hoping that maybe [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6022.36s)]
*  it would ping off something saying, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6025.2s)]
*  I don't know if I'm gonna make it out of here alive, right? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6026.36s)]
*  And so at the end of this 15 minutes of go back and forth, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6028.879999999999s)]
*  the lead elder reaches back [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6033.06s)]
*  and some lady hands him a machete. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6035.780000000001s)]
*  At that point, I thought I was dead. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6038.34s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I'm done. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6039.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm done. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6040.62s)]
*  It's over. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6041.5s)]
*  So that he gets the machete, he puts it on his side. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6042.34s)]
*  Everyone stands up, walks out. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6044.62s)]
*  My translator's not saying shit to me, you know? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6046.14s)]
*  And I'm like, what is going on, you know? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6048.42s)]
*  So finally he says, okay, I talked to the chief. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6050.42s)]
*  He said, he will take you to the cave [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6052.820000000001s)]
*  for like what equated to like 40 bucks, right? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6055.700000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh my, I got $40. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6058.66s)]
*  I saved my life. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6060.34s)]
*  I got an escrow, I'm in, you know? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6061.24s)]
*  By the way, we would have never found this cave. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6062.96s)]
*  It was a trail that like an hour into the bush, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6065.96s)]
*  we would have been lost in 15 minutes, you know? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6068.84s)]
*  But the guy took us into the cave, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6071.0s)]
*  did this really bad ass ritual. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6073.84s)]
*  He had like, he had an egg that was in a handkerchief. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6075.4s)]
*  He like split the machete was to get like off a sacred tree [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6077.639999999999s)]
*  to knock a branch off. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6081.599999999999s)]
*  And then he puts the branch down, puts the egg on top [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6083.24s)]
*  and then sings this ritual for safe passage into the cave. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6085.719999999999s)]
*  And so we go in there and sure. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6089.92s)]
*  Like the craziest hardies you could ever be at. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6091.32s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6093.12s)]
*  And so we go in there bat guana up to my waist. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6093.96s)]
*  No way. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6097.32s)]
*  I mean, just raining bat poop, right? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6098.16s)]
*  And we caught some snakes in there [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6100.88s)]
*  and it was a great adventure, man. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6104.04s)]
*  It was a great adventure, you know? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6105.52s)]
*  So I think Noel have those adventures in the future as well. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6106.8s)]
*  You know, it's probably one of the coolest things [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6109.76s)]
*  I've ever done. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6110.96s)]
*  I did fall into the bat guana at one point, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6111.8s)]

*  slip fell into the bat guana. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6115.72s)]
*  I was covered in bat crap. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6118.12s)]
*  I only had one change of clothes [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6120.76s)]
*  and then had to hike an hour back up to the thing [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6122.2s)]
*  to drive four hours back home. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIRGCNqG5Q8&t=6125.24s)]
