*  They hired me to wrap presents, which I'm terrible at. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=350.56s)]
*  So then they were like, these presents are terrible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=354.12s)]
*  So they put me in the back room to like sort things and I only lasted two weeks. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=357.12s)]
*  I was like, I just started singing and playing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=360.8s)]
*  I was 17, but I needed like, I was not making any money. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  I was like a starving musician. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  And so I would try for that, like, you know, that like holiday season extra money and realized [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=367.96s)]
*  quickly like I've got to make the music business work because this is not for me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=373.96s)]
*  Because that's not it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=377.76s)]
*  No, it was just not. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=378.76s)]
*  I wasn't good at anything else. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=380.52s)]
*  So I was like, yeah, if they put you in the back to sort, that's not even. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  I know I couldn't even use it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=385.12s)]
*  Well, because I, someone lady asked me like, does this look good on me? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=386.56s)]
*  And I told her my truth. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=388.67999999999995s)]
*  I was like, not really. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=389.67999999999995s)]

*  I'm like, oh. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=392.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think if I, well, I used to work at a pizza parlor for a while and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=393.68s)]
*  we got laid with, there were cutbacks there or whatever. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=401.64s)]

*  It's like, there was four of us working there, but I guess they had like cutbacks or whatever. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  So a couple of us got laid off. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  But I wonder if I ever worked at a department store. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=413.36s)]
*  I couldn't work around pizza. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=417.56s)]

*  And I was really happy about that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=427.56s)]
*  They put corn dogs on the salad bar? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=429.32s)]
*  I love a salad bar. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=430.56s)]

*  You remember? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=435.36s)]

*  No? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=444.0s)]
*  Nobody knows how to do that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=445.0s)]
*  Now I know I've actually seen it in real time now because my husband is from New York City. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=446.0s)]
*  So I've had like legit pizza now. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=449.32s)]
*  Not Pizza Inn. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=452.24s)]
*  Oh, we had a place, I'm trying to think of what it was called. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=453.24s)]
*  But they had a big window there and some dude, I think he was a magician, but they gave him [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=455.54s)]
*  like daytime work throwing those pizzas in the air because I think it just fit in people's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=459.8s)]
*  heads like, oh, that's magic. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=463.64s)]

*  Oh, he was, I think he really got the hang of it and it was awesome. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=467.6s)]
*  People would come from miles around to watch him, you know? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=470.44s)]
*  You'd see kids just out there just licking lollipops, just staring at him, looking at [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  this dough wizard. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=476.56s)]
*  Small town entertainment is pretty simple. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=478.84s)]
*  It's easy to come up with. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=481.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=483.67999999999995s)]

*  We could go to the fair a day before and for 50 cents you could, you were kind of a guinea [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=487.32s)]
*  pig. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=491.2s)]

*  cents. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=496.64s)]
*  So we lived right down the street from the fairgrounds. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=497.64s)]
*  So we'd walk down there, dude, and you would just get rattled, electrocuted. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=498.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=503.35999999999996s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=512.24s)]
*  How? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=513.24s)]
*  You seem like a thrill tracer because you got tased and you ride the 50 cent ride. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=514.24s)]
*  You're just going for it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=518.24s)]
*  I've been in some bad relationships. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=519.92s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I'm a thrill tracer. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=521.2s)]

*  How does a regular police officer meet a celebrity comfortably? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=533.68s)]
*  Is that a weird thing to ask kind of? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=541.16s)]
*  Oh, I mean, honestly, like we're kind of from the same fabric. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=543.12s)]
*  So it was the weirdest part of it all is the language barrier at first, honestly, because [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=548.3199999999999s)]

*  would help my buddy open all the valentines, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=625.04s)]
*  like on valentines in school, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=627.56s)]
*  they would have like the key club or whatever would come in. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  And if somebody bought you a valentine, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=631.52s)]
*  they'd give them all out in the room at the same time. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=632.68s)]
*  So my buddy would get like 11 of them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't get any, but he'd let me like hold a couple of them [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=637.36s)]
*  on my desk or whatever. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=639.8s)]
*  Make you feel good? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=641.24s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like, hey hold- [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  And isn't it like, wasn't it like the one where you give [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=642.92s)]
*  everybody in the class one so everybody feels love? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=644.6s)]
*  Oh, when we were kids, but when it got into junior high, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=647.24s)]
*  it got like, okay, somebody had to go. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=649.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=651.68s)]
*  And you would get him and he would just have a stack of them. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=652.68s)]
*  He looked like the damn bachelor. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=654.72s)]
*  You're gonna get so many valentines out, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=655.56s)]
*  it's gonna be weird. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  Cause you talked about it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=657.92s)]
*  That's a good point, huh? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=658.76s)]
*  Yeah, valentines were nice. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=660.72s)]
*  My mom wouldn't get us like something that she would like [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  leave by our like bed or something in the morning. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  Like that was pretty sweet though. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=667.6s)]
*  But yeah, was there ever a moment where he was just like, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=670.92s)]
*  where it just seemed like, like he's like, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=673.16s)]
*  I'm a regular guy and you're a regular person. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=675.96s)]
*  But then there's always like a, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=679.64s)]
*  I think there's a fear in like a regular guy's head [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=680.88s)]
*  of like how you would behave around a celebrity, I guess. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=683.76s)]
*  I think- [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=686.8s)]
*  Does it make any sense at all? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=687.84s)]
*  Yeah, and it definitely is an adjustment to like just jump [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=688.68s)]
*  into country music world and moved to Nashville. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=691.2s)]
*  I mean, he like retired, you know, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=693.88s)]
*  he was eight years on the department [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=697.24s)]
*  and he like sort of made the choice. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=698.48s)]
*  We made the choice together of like, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=700.6s)]
*  we gotta be together, you know, and- [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=702.64s)]
*  You had to trade your gun in for a harmonica [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=704.48s)]
*  or whatever is a big deal. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=706.36s)]
*  I think, well, thank God he didn't, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=708.0s)]
*  cause I don't know if he, he loves music. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=709.96s)]
*  He's not necessarily musical. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=712.44s)]
*  He did write a song on my new record. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=714.2s)]
*  He's a co-writer on a song on my new record. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=716.16s)]
*  Yeah, I had him writing during 2020. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=718.0s)]
*  We were all doing anything during 2020. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=721.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, things got weird. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=723.64s)]
*  Just like big, yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=724.48s)]
*  Oh, if cops were writing songs, yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=725.32s)]
*  It was like, let's write songs. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=727.16s)]
*  And so we did and he was pretty good. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=728.4s)]
*  And I guess, cause I mean, growing up in New York city [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=731.76s)]
*  and like being a cop on the street in Times Square, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=733.84s)]
*  like you have a lot of life lived, you know? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  And so this record, he has a co-writer [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=739.0s)]
*  on my song called Dammit Randy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=741.56s)]
*  And he had some of the best lines in the song. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=742.92s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=744.76s)]
*  So he- Oh wait, I've heard that one something [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=745.6s)]
*  like in a hurricane. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=747.52s)]
*  That was his line. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=749.0799999999999s)]
*  Nuh-uh. Flying a kite in a hurricane. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=750.16s)]
*  I was like, dang it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=751.9599999999999s)]
*  That is a good line. Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=753.12s)]
*  It is a good line. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=754.4399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, you know, I think that like [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=756.6s)]
*  all the celebrity part out of it, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=759.16s)]
*  I don't care about that stuff, you know? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=760.24s)]
*  So it just made it, we're just real and regular. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=761.52s)]
*  Like I said, both being from first responder families, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=766.0s)]
*  like we kind of grew up the same. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  There was some glue there. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=770.7199999999999s)]
*  Just different places, yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=771.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm just trying to inspire like regular men out there [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=773.92s)]
*  to think that they could handle it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  If they met a celebrity person in that world, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=777.6s)]
*  that everything could be cool. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=780.48s)]
*  They can. And you know what? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  It's like, I'm such a big stickler of like, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=783.36s)]
*  don't surround yourself with yes people. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=785.92s)]
*  And so having a husband that's just a regular guy, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=788.04s)]
*  like just being a cop in New York city. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=791.8s)]
*  He comes into my world, but he tells me the truth. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=795.8000000000001s)]
*  He like calls me on my shit. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=798.36s)]
*  He tells me the truth. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=800.0s)]
*  He doesn't sugar coat. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=801.12s)]
*  He sees everything for what it is. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=802.2800000000001s)]
*  And I really appreciate that. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=804.2800000000001s)]
*  Like there's the fact that he's not in my industry at all [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=805.64s)]
*  and just really kind of, it's a straight shooter. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=808.72s)]
*  It's like, it's such a blessing to have in my life. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  And so I'm glad that I married somebody [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=814.08s)]
*  that just like is that way. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  That is just a regular blue collar guy [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=818.88s)]
*  that sort of comes in and enhances my world [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=820.48s)]
*  and speaks a lot of truth into my life. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=823.48s)]
*  So y'all go, all y'all regular dudes go, go get it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=826.24s)]

*  That's a great call. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=831.76s)]
*  He also married like a country singer and a horse girl. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  And so, I mean, he signed up for a lot. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=835.0s)]
*  Cause horse girls are like, we're different breed. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=838.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=840.88s)]
*  I just met, I went to a therapy place for like a week [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  and they had horses out there. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=844.52s)]
*  And one of the therapists like worked with the horses. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=846.52s)]
*  She was like the horse therapist lady or whatever. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  Like the- [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=850.96s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  And so like she had met there hugging this big old horse. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=852.64s)]
*  I don't think, I don't know what his name was. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=856.84s)]
*  I've done that too. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=859.0s)]
*  The equine therapy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=859.84s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=860.68s)]
*  I thought it was crazy, but it's really neat. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=861.72s)]
*  It teaches you so much. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=864.1999999999999s)]
*  Like where they're like, put your hand where you feel like [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=865.72s)]
*  the, put your hand where you feel most drawn to the horse [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=869.24s)]
*  and like immediately put my hand on its heart. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=871.84s)]
*  I didn't even know where a horse heart was. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  Now that I think about it, like I was like, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=876.8s)]
*  I don't know where it is in that huge giant chest. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=880.72s)]
*  Oh, I had to take the horse. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=881.84s)]
*  I was trying to take his pulse and I had to do with [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=882.84s)]
*  both of my hands like that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=884.2800000000001s)]
*  Like horses are crazy. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=885.64s)]
*  They just got like 60 inches of neck on them. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=887.44s)]
*  But yeah, it was kind of wild. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=890.96s)]
*  Cause at first she's like, okay, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  approach the horse and let it know you're okay. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=893.76s)]
*  And so then I'm like four feet from this horse. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  I think his name was Knuckles or like Mitten or something. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=898.52s)]
*  And I'm like, hey horse, I'm just letting you know I'm here. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=901.88s)]
*  Like it was almost like meeting an alien. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=905.96s)]
*  Cause I just never even been around a horse [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=907.6800000000001s)]
*  like in that much like proximity, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=909.88s)]
*  like just being a horse in a pen. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=912.1999999999999s)]
*  But by the end I got to take the horse for a walk and stuff. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=914.24s)]
*  And I felt like it was cool because at first [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=916.8s)]
*  I was super nervous and as I went along, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=919.16s)]
*  it kind of like, yeah, I kind of like my idol came down. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  And that they're so therapeutic, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=927.92s)]
*  just being around them in general, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=930.24s)]
*  but like they're just majestic creatures. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=931.72s)]
*  And I heard, I think they can hear your heartbeat [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=934.0799999999999s)]
*  from like five miles away or something. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=936.12s)]
*  Oh my God, perverts. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=937.72s)]
*  You see? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=939.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy dude. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=940.2s)]
*  I mean, that's eavesdropping. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=942.52s)]
*  I know, but they could sense everything. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=944.44s)]
*  It's like, they tell you the truth about you [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=947.0s)]
*  before you even know your own truth. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=948.6s)]
*  You're like, ah, I didn't grow up around horses. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=949.92s)]
*  I didn't start until I was 30. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=952.16s)]
*  And I just wanted to do something that scared me a little. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=953.6s)]
*  And I always wanted to be with that cowgirl. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  Like I used to play all the rodeos back in the day [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=958.2s)]
*  and like singing the national anthem and small town rodeos. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=960.5600000000001s)]
*  I love rodeos. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=963.48s)]
*  When I was first getting started and all those like flag girls [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=964.32s)]
*  and the barrel racers with all the glitter and fringe, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=966.76s)]
*  I wanted to be that so bad. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=969.08s)]
*  And I chose country music. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=970.28s)]
*  And so I was like at 30, I was like, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=971.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna be a cowgirl, dammit, I'm gonna do this. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I started riding for the first time at 30 [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=977.1600000000001s)]
*  and now I'm really super into it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=980.48s)]
*  I love it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=982.72s)]
*  But I was, I mean, I'm still like, I'm green. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=983.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what I'm doing, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=986.6s)]
*  but I just love like having a hobby [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=987.52s)]
*  completely outside of what I do that's challenging [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=990.0400000000001s)]
*  and physically challenging. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=993.0s)]
*  And also it's like not up to you. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=994.2s)]
*  It's up to them, you know? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=996.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=997.5999999999999s)]
*  It is like, that's the dang Lord's Uber, dude, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=998.8s)]
*  being on a horseback. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1002.0799999999999s)]
*  The Lord's Uber. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1003.28s)]
*  Bro, you get on a horse, it is not, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1004.4s)]
*  it's like kind of up to you. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1006.8s)]
*  That's my pony. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1008.1199999999999s)]
*  Because they give you these little strings. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  You're like, these strings, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1010.04s)]
*  they're not gonna do anything against this horse, you know? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  No, like I just saw that pull up on the screen. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1013.76s)]
*  My horse, Cool, I started mounted shooting. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1015.76s)]
*  Oh, his name's Cool? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1018.5999999999999s)]
*  His name's Cool and I started mounted shooting [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  last December. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  And what does that mean, mounted shooting? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1022.28s)]
*  So like shooting a revolver with black powder [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1023.9599999999999s)]
*  off the back of the horse at a balloon. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1026.68s)]
*  It's super fun. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1028.6000000000001s)]
*  It's spectator safe and the horses wear earplugs. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1030.2800000000002s)]
*  Just FYI. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1032.8000000000002s)]
*  The horses do? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1034.1200000000001s)]
*  They do, they wear earplugs. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1034.96s)]
*  And the gun has black powder in it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1036.24s)]
*  And so you do these patterns [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1038.96s)]
*  and you go like 100 miles an hour. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1040.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't yet, I'm trying to get there. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1041.64s)]
*  And you shoot at balloons. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1043.48s)]
*  My friend, Kenda Lonsane, she's like the world champion. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1045.6000000000001s)]
*  And she- [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1048.6000000000001s)]
*  Kenda Lonsane, bring her up. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1049.5200000000002s)]
*  She's a badass. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1051.5200000000002s)]
*  Like she has taken me under her wing [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1052.44s)]
*  and taught me so much about it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1055.1200000000001s)]
*  I've never even heard of this. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1056.8400000000001s)]
*  So it's called mounted shooting. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1057.68s)]
*  So you started- [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1058.72s)]
*  There she is. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1060.3200000000002s)]
*  Let's see that beauty. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1061.16s)]
*  That's her, she's a beauty. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1062.0s)]
*  Hey, I'll let her shoot me, that's for sure. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1063.2800000000002s)]
*  She probably would. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1066.0400000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1066.88s)]
*  She'd probably tase you if you wanted her to. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1067.72s)]
*  Look, she can shoot me in the belt buckle [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1069.48s)]
*  and see if my pants drop. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1071.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, baby? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1072.6000000000001s)]
*  That's where I'm at with her. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1073.72s)]
*  She's a buckle shiner. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1074.96s)]
*  She's a, but she's really great at it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1076.0800000000002s)]
*  So wait, explain it to me. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1078.2s)]
*  I've never even heard of this. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1079.2s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1080.4s)]
*  So you have two revolvers. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  And you have five shots in each. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1084.3600000000001s)]
*  And you're on the horse. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1085.96s)]
*  It's a gun belt, you're on the horse. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1086.8000000000002s)]
*  And it's a timed event. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1087.7600000000002s)]
*  So like come out of the gate [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  and like she does it in like 7.5 seconds. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1090.92s)]
*  I'm still learning to ride good enough. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1093.96s)]
*  So I'm a lot slower. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1095.72s)]
*  Oh, she's used to a quick shot. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1096.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm in again. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1097.96s)]
*  Yeah, see, so you're shooting at a pattern of balloons [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1098.8000000000002s)]
*  and you're timed on the event [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1102.8000000000002s)]
*  and you do five shots and a gun change. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1104.8400000000001s)]
*  So while you're riding 100 miles an hour, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1107.48s)]
*  you're having to shoot, aim, switch your gun, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1109.24s)]
*  go around a barrel, go around a pattern. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1112.28s)]
*  Like it's very challenging. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1114.12s)]
*  Super fun though. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1116.08s)]
*  It's like the most adrenaline rush. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1116.92s)]
*  It sounds like ADHD meets Yellowstone. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1119.24s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1122.32s)]
*  But it sounds beautiful. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1123.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1124.56s)]
*  It is called mounted shooting. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1125.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1127.48s)]
*  And so do you get to try that? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1128.32s)]
*  So you have your own horse. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1129.16s)]
*  That was nice to get, wasn't that? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1129.98s)]
*  Yeah, I bought a horse. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1130.82s)]
*  I was one of those like, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  I did it once and loved it so much. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1133.56s)]
*  I was like, I'm gonna winter in Arizona. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1135.04s)]
*  I'm buying the horse. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1137.44s)]
*  I'm buying the guns. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1138.28s)]
*  Like I fully got into it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1139.24s)]
*  But I just, you know, I feel like at 30, I started riding. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1141.2s)]
*  And then I turned 40 in November, last November. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  And I was like, all right, now's a new season [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1148.0800000000002s)]
*  to keep pushing myself and try something [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1149.8s)]
*  that's a little scary, but new and outside of my wheelhouse. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1152.2s)]
*  Well, you look beautiful for 40. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1155.96s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1157.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1158.28s)]

*  I learned so much from all of them. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1433.8s)]
*  Like Keith Urban was my first one, 2005. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1435.16s)]
*  And then, because I just played Honky Tonks until then. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1439.4s)]
*  And then Dirk Spintley and George Toby, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1442.16s)]
*  I think was like my fourth big black major country tour. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1445.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1449.04s)]
*  And I learned a lot. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1449.88s)]
*  I mean, oh gosh, old school. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1450.7s)]
*  Look at that hair. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1451.54s)]
*  That is like Wendell Tex's hair. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1452.38s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1454.3600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1456.2s)]
*  Little old school tease it to Jesus. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1458.28s)]
*  That's what we say. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1460.76s)]
*  Oh, the Lord does my hair while I sleep. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1464.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1466.3600000000001s)]
*  So it don't even, yeah. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1467.2s)]
*  Wow, that's cool. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1468.3600000000001s)]
*  What was Toby like? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1469.34s)]
*  Like, what was he like? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1470.48s)]
*  I just never got to meet him. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1471.32s)]
*  I've gotten to meet some different artists [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1472.66s)]
*  that I'm a big fan of. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1474.2s)]
*  But what was he like as a person? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1476.44s)]
*  He was really, he was like, he was himself. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1478.3600000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1481.76s)]
*  Like he was his, like authentically himself. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1482.66s)]
*  Kind of did everything his own way, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1486.08s)]
*  an outlaw in his own way, prolific songwriter. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1488.0s)]
*  And you know, he was kind of a tough love [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1491.8999999999999s)]
*  at first out on the road. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1495.12s)]
*  But I guess I needed that because I was a baby [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1497.9199999999998s)]
*  and didn't know what was going on yet. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1499.6599999999999s)]
*  I was learning all the ropes of everything. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1502.9199999999998s)]
*  And it was, I learned so much from every tour I was on. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1504.96s)]
*  And I would say Toby was just like, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1509.22s)]
*  like his fans taught me a lot too [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1512.84s)]
*  because they were really about Toby only. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1514.56s)]
*  Like you had to work to get them to care. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1517.6s)]
*  You know, because they were like, we're here to see Toby. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1520.96s)]
*  And his like outlaw kind of I am who I am mentality, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1523.1599999999999s)]
*  they kind of adopted that. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1528.1599999999999s)]
*  And I felt like it made me work for it in a good way. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1529.32s)]
*  Like I had to really figure out my set list [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1531.84s)]
*  and figure out like, I'm just some little gal. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1536.54s)]
*  They're not here to see me. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1538.54s)]
*  And if they're here early, I really need to, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1539.44s)]
*  I'm here to gain fans. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1541.7s)]
*  I gotta work on this. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1542.78s)]
*  I gotta capture that. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1543.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1544.4599999999998s)]
*  Did you get to interact with him before he passed away? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1545.4199999999998s)]
*  I haven't, I did see him at the BMI awards [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1548.3799999999999s)]
*  when he got the songwriter legend award a couple years ago. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1553.08s)]
*  So it was right before he passed away. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1556.78s)]
*  And could you tell he was sick then? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1559.3s)]
*  I just, cause it was, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1560.6999999999998s)]
*  I knew people who knew he was sick for a long time. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1561.78s)]
*  He just didn't like put much out there about it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1563.3s)]
*  It seemed like it was very private, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1565.06s)]
*  but I guess who would want to, right? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1566.82s)]
*  Yeah. Well, and I was, I mean, when he was there, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1568.3799999999999s)]
*  he sounded great and he looked great. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1570.6599999999999s)]
*  So I mean, you know, that journey is like, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1572.26s)]
*  everybody's gotta take that journey [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1575.46s)]
*  and however they feel comfortable [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1577.3799999999999s)]
*  and their family and all that stuff. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1578.7s)]
*  But I know that he was, even at the end, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1580.1s)]
*  like really about the music, you know? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1584.42s)]
*  Cause the last big thing I saw him at was the BMI's [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1586.74s)]
*  and it was all about his catalog. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1589.46s)]
*  And I did not realize how many, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1590.9s)]
*  he wrote like 150 songs a year or something like crazy. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1592.74s)]
*  Like just prolific. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1596.26s)]
*  And I also didn't realize how many outside songs he cut, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1598.32s)]
*  or that he had other artists cut of his until that ceremony. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1602.1000000000001s)]
*  Is there ever a song where you write it [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1607.3400000000001s)]
*  and you think it's good, but it's not for you? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1609.06s)]
*  A lot. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1611.22s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1612.06s)]
*  A lot of times. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1613.46s)]
*  Yeah. And I, you know, it's, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1616.3s)]
*  I'm thankful that some artists are still willing [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1618.5s)]
*  to cut outside songs. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1621.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm one of those artists. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1622.18s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1623.5s)]
*  That they're willing to cut outside songs? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1624.3400000000001s)]
*  Like, you can't cut every song you ever write, you know? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1625.74s)]
*  And so for instance, Aaron sent me Armadillo [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1630.42s)]
*  and I was like, I love this, I'm cutting it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1634.38s)]
*  So, you know, I think it's important [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1636.9s)]
*  if you're a songwriter to have a balance of, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1639.02s)]
*  we live in Nashville, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1642.1000000000001s)]
*  like there's amazing songs written all day, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1643.22s)]
*  every day in this town for years. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1645.54s)]
*  And I think it's cool when artists are not trying [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1647.94s)]
*  to write every song on their records. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1650.78s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying, because at a certain point, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1653.5800000000002s)]
*  it almost, you're just able to help out more people [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1655.5800000000002s)]
*  by picking up songs that they've written really. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1657.94s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, like for my career, I mean, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1660.94s)]
*  my biggest songs I wouldn't have [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1663.78s)]
*  if I would have tried to write everything. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1666.38s)]
*  I mean, like, House That Build Me is a staple in my career. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1667.8200000000002s)]
*  And that's, I didn't write that. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1671.5s)]
*  And Mama's Broken Heart and Little Red Wagon. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1673.8600000000001s)]
*  Like I have some of the staples drunk, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1678.02s)]
*  some of the staples in my set that are like career staple [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1680.9s)]
*  songs are not songs I wrote. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1684.22s)]
*  So I think it's good to keep the door open to like, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1685.98s)]
*  you know, look around town, look where we live. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1689.1s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1691.02s)]
*  Right, yeah. So many people, yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1691.8600000000001s)]
*  And you can't do things alone too. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1693.18s)]
*  That's one thing I realized, like, kind of like, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1694.6200000000001s)]
*  as I get older, it's like, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1696.82s)]
*  I used to want to do everything by myself. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1698.14s)]
*  It was just like how I was wired. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1700.22s)]
*  And it still is a lot of times, but it's certainly, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1702.1s)]
*  it started to alleviate some where it's like, I got, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1704.46s)]
*  I need help, I need people to do, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1707.74s)]
*  and I need people to help me do things [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1709.3s)]
*  and I can help people do things. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1711.82s)]
*  And then it's more fun to do something [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1714.5800000000002s)]
*  with somebody sometimes. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1716.02s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like when you celebrate the highs [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1717.42s)]
*  with your friends, cause you all did it together, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1720.46s)]
*  like a co-write, you know, it's fun. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1722.46s)]
*  Like collaborating is great. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1724.1000000000001s)]
*  Nashville is such a good community for that. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1725.5800000000002s)]
*  Like everybody's, I mean, you know, you live here, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1728.14s)]
*  like everybody's so, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1731.02s)]
*  country music community is very collaborative [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1733.78s)]
*  and we lift each other up and we kind of stick together. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1736.7s)]
*  You know, you don't have to look. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1738.74s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1739.5800000000002s)]
*  I do think it's true. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1740.42s)]
*  For me, it has been for 20 years. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1741.54s)]
*  And not that you have to love every single person [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1744.94s)]
*  you ever work with or in the business, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1746.46s)]
*  but I feel like everybody's kind of in it [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1748.38s)]
*  for the same reason. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1750.74s)]
*  And there's a mutual respect there most times. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1752.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1754.46s)]
*  Yeah, I guess, but it's also competitive, right? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1756.42s)]
*  Yeah. But I think that's also good. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1758.5s)]
*  You gotta like compete, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1760.9s)]
*  but I think there's a difference in, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1762.9s)]
*  of my manager, we've been together 21 years. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1764.78s)]
*  And I just recently went on a birthday trip with her [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1767.3400000000001s)]
*  and one of her really good friends [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1769.54s)]
*  who's born and raised in Belle Meade. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1770.78s)]
*  Her name's Elizabeth. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1773.18s)]
*  And she said, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1774.02s)]
*  there's a difference in wanting to win [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1774.8600000000001s)]
*  and wanting to beat everybody. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1776.54s)]
*  And I thought that was really poignant. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1778.46s)]
*  I was like, that, that it, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1780.42s)]
*  cause that's a different mindset. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1781.9s)]
*  Like it's okay to want to win and, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1783.5s)]
*  and like compete and be on top, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1785.46s)]
*  but I don't, I don't think you have to want to go into it, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1787.5800000000002s)]
*  going, I'm going to beat everybody. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1790.8200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1792.38s)]
*  I'm just going to win at my race. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1793.22s)]
*  Yeah. Cause that's almost, it's almost, it's not, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1794.3400000000001s)]
*  but it's almost, yeah, I'm trying to think of the word. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1797.38s)]
*  Really almost as a negative edge to it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1801.3s)]
*  It does. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1803.86s)]
*  Cause I want somebody to lose then. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1804.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1806.78s)]

*  Yeah. Thanks for thinking about that kind of stuff with me. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1812.54s)]
*  Yeah. Cause I love songwriting and it's, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1815.1s)]
*  Oh, in Nashville, anything can happen. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1816.4199999999998s)]
*  You, like you'll drop a tomato at Trader Joe's [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1818.02s)]
*  and somebody will come up [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1821.26s)]
*  and have half a stanza written about it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1822.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like, yeah, you get in a car accident [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1823.86s)]
*  and the guy gets out of the vehicle [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1826.62s)]
*  and he's already written a couple bars about the accident. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1828.54s)]
*  And he's like, what do you think of these? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1831.26s)]
*  And I'm like, what do you think about [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1832.54s)]
*  give me your insurance papers? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1833.7s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1835.1s)]
*  Well, that's the title insurance papers. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1835.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1837.02s)]
*  But it really is. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1837.86s)]
*  What's in your glove box? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1839.7s)]
*  That's a good song title. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1840.7s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1842.02s)]
*  Yeah. What's in your glove box, dude? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1844.22s)]
*  It better just be gloves, buddy. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1845.86s)]
*  Yeah. If there's gloves, that's weird. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1847.62s)]
*  Why is it called a glove box? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1849.82s)]
*  Because people- [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1851.42s)]
*  Now that we talked about it, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1852.26s)]
*  it's even weirder if there's gloves in there. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1853.1s)]
*  It is weirder now, isn't it? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1854.58s)]
*  And it started off by- [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1856.06s)]
*  It's only supposed to be your insurance. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1856.9s)]
*  Because people used to put, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1858.34s)]
*  the name is derived from the compartment's original purpose, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1860.7s)]
*  storing driving gloves. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1863.1s)]
*  Initially the glove compartment was a box, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1864.3s)]
*  and you're the driver on the floorboard. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1865.86s)]
*  Driving gloves were worn to keep hands clean [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1868.18s)]
*  and considered essential equipment in early vehicles. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1870.06s)]
*  Driving gloves are important for women now too, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1873.5s)]
*  because our hands, they like keep you from aging [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1875.3s)]
*  because your hands are on the wheel. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1877.54s)]
*  And like, I didn't know that, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1879.58s)]
*  but like driving gloves are a thing. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1880.6599999999999s)]
*  But why does it keep you from aging? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1882.34s)]
*  Because the sun, coming through the windshield, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1883.7s)]
*  you wear like gloves while you drive [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1886.5s)]
*  so that the sun's not like getting on your hands. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1888.42s)]
*  Honey, you're only driving a Smyrna, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1890.14s)]
*  that ain't a lot of sunshine on them. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1891.38s)]
*  I don't know, but I ride in gloves now because of that. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1893.5s)]
*  My horse, I have my little gloves, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1896.02s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want sun damage. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1897.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I thought you ride a shotgun in a car. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1898.94s)]
*  I ride my horse with gloves on now, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1901.7s)]

*  There's so much to think about. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1906.02s)]
*  It's a full-time job. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1907.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, you don't want aging hands though. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1908.5s)]
*  No. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1910.46s)]
*  Because you can hide everything else, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1911.3s)]
*  but you can't just show up to something [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1912.82s)]
*  with mittens on for no reason. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1914.22s)]
*  Dolly does wear those sheer gloves with the rhinestones, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1915.6599999999999s)]
*  and I'm kind of like really into that. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1917.78s)]
*  So that's a vibe. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1919.1s)]
*  Somebody said she's full-body tatted up. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1920.5s)]

*  to the bottom of this. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1935.3s)]
*  Does Dolly have the tattoos or not? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=1936.1399999999999s)]

*  And like, I guess it was like the first kind of, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2015.42s)]
*  oh my God, one of my heroes is gone, you know, feelings. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2020.34s)]
*  I was lucky enough to get to sing with him and meet him [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2024.34s)]
*  and know his family. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2026.5s)]
*  And so that was awesome. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2028.82s)]
*  In fact, I just saw his family this past summer [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2030.62s)]
*  at the Plains State Fair and Ben Haggard [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2033.3s)]
*  and the family opened. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2035.82s)]
*  But I just, I don't know. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2037.1399999999999s)]
*  That was, Merle's my like, number one, you know? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2038.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, what'd you admire about him you think so much? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2043.9399999999998s)]
*  I think that, you know, he, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2046.3s)]
*  one of my favorite quotes is from Johnny Cash. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2048.9s)]
*  And he said, I sing about the things [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2050.74s)]
*  that Merle Haggard actually lived. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2052.7799999999997s)]
*  Cause he literally turned 21 in prison. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2055.2999999999997s)]
*  Like he told his truth. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2057.18s)]
*  Like he didn't have a glamorous childhood or upbringing. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2058.46s)]
*  And he took his outlaw and sort of the troubled times [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2061.7s)]
*  of his life turned him into songs [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2066.46s)]
*  and turned it into a beautiful career. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2068.26s)]
*  And every time I was ever around him, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2069.82s)]
*  he's one of those heroes that like, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2071.94s)]
*  is exactly what you hope he would be. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2074.18s)]
*  Like a little mysterious, but super kind, you know? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2077.54s)]
*  And it's always like, meet your heroes or not, it's scary. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2080.2200000000003s)]
*  Cause what if they're, what if they let you down? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2083.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2085.82s)]
*  But he never did. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2086.66s)]

*  Oh man, my friend Jessie Alexander wrote that song. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2192.4599999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2194.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes, she did. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2195.14s)]
*  And she's amazing. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2195.9799999999996s)]
*  She wrote it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2197.06s)]
*  I don't know who she wrote it with, but I know she wrote it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2197.8999999999996s)]
*  It's a great song. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2199.4599999999996s)]
*  She, yeah, oh, it's so good. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2200.7s)]
*  And Lee's delivery is like insane. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2202.5s)]
*  See, but that's a song that he didn't write. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2204.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2207.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2208.02s)]
*  And that's why it takes a group. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2208.86s)]
*  It's like, but you also, if he doesn't perform it, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2209.7s)]
*  if somebody else does, who knows if it works the same? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2211.34s)]
*  It could. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2214.1s)]
*  It all has to land in the right basket, right? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2214.94s)]
*  Like the right song finds the right artist [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2217.22s)]
*  at the right time. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2219.62s)]

*  Yeah, The House That Built Me, too. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2222.3s)]
*  I had, I saw some, that song, the writers of that song, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2224.06s)]
*  it took them, like they wrote that song for like seven years. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2229.1s)]
*  Alan Shamblin and Tom Douglas, yes. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2233.02s)]
*  They rewrote it and rewrote it. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2235.54s)]
*  It's seven years of writing it. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2236.9s)]
*  But that is such a lesson. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2238.82s)]
*  Like I'm not good at that at all. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2240.86s)]
*  Like I'm kind of millennial about my, like I know, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2242.06s)]
*  I want to come into this co-write today [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2246.06s)]
*  and then I'm going to leave with a song. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2247.78s)]
*  Like in, you know, four hours, you get a song [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2249.3s)]
*  or two hours or whatever it is. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2252.7s)]
*  I don't know that I could have stuck with it [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2254.86s)]
*  for seven years. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2256.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2257.62s)]
*  It's a lesson to all of us to like be patient [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2258.46s)]
*  till it's right. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2260.34s)]
*  Oh, that song is like perfectly written. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2261.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2263.1s)]
*  Yeah, they made like a real Sistine Chapel with that one. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2264.06s)]
*  Dude, I remember it's kind of weird maybe, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2267.34s)]
*  but like I grew up in like a pretty traumatic youth, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2268.82s)]
*  you know, and I heard that song just a couple years ago, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2272.02s)]
*  maybe two years ago. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2277.94s)]
*  It was like Christmas time. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2278.98s)]
*  I was in my town where I grew up [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2280.14s)]
*  and I went and got like an orchid or whatever [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2283.86s)]
*  from a flower place. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2287.26s)]
*  And I took it back to the place that I grew up at. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2290.2200000000003s)]
*  And I went, this sounds really bizarre now. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2293.46s)]
*  I wasn't doing peep and tom or anything. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2297.0200000000004s)]
*  It was like, I knocked on the door and I gave them that. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2298.5800000000004s)]
*  I was like. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2302.7400000000002s)]
*  I think that's really cool. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2304.78s)]
*  Yeah, I said something nice should grow here. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2306.2200000000003s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2308.0600000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2309.26s)]
*  And I gave them that. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2310.1000000000004s)]
*  That's a song. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2310.94s)]
*  You said that to the songwriter, so. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2311.94s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2313.94s)]
*  You don't have to write it down. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2314.78s)]
*  But honestly. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2316.26s)]
*  But it's funny that what a song can do to somebody. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2317.1000000000004s)]
*  Yes, because that's, I didn't write that song, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2319.5800000000004s)]
*  but I was like, how did they know my story? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2321.46s)]
*  Like, but my guitar player that was with me forever [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2323.0600000000004s)]
*  since I was 17, we lost him two years ago. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2326.7400000000002s)]
*  But he said that song hits me [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2329.6200000000003s)]
*  because it's what I wish I had. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2333.6600000000003s)]
*  And that sounds like what you're talking about. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2336.5800000000004s)]
*  Like, and I never thought about it from that perspective. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2338.46s)]
*  Oh, he wished he'd had those things at his home. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2340.86s)]
*  He wished he would have had the house that built him. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2342.7000000000003s)]
*  But he didn't have like a healthy childhood. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2344.58s)]
*  And so, you know, but I just, I love a song like that. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2347.54s)]
*  And the fact that they waited it out [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2351.46s)]
*  and just stayed with it is like goals. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2354.38s)]
*  I gotta work on it. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2358.66s)]
*  I gotta work on it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2359.5s)]
*  Yeah, that is, yeah. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2360.98s)]
*  Yeah, who knows like what things, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2362.34s)]
*  and that's what's the one thing that's nice about life. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2364.1s)]
*  It's like, you don't know the little things you're doing now, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2366.2599999999998s)]
*  how they'll merge with like the things you're doing later on [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2368.7s)]
*  and how it'll help you form like wherever you're supposed [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2371.54s)]
*  to be like sometimes it's so hard to get through [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2374.7s)]
*  just the moment, you know, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2377.66s)]
*  but you don't realize that the moment are the stairs [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2378.66s)]
*  that are gonna get you to the place [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2380.42s)]
*  you're supposed to stand, you know? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2383.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2384.7s)]
*  Anyway, sorry, but yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2386.14s)]
*  And those people must have thought I was bad shit crazy, dude. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2389.2599999999998s)]
*  No, but it's not. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2392.1s)]
*  Like the house I grew up in was an old tobacco farm [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2392.94s)]
*  and it was a house built in 1905. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2395.8599999999997s)]
*  And it was just a farmhouse, no central heat and air, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2399.02s)]
*  one bathroom, like not like a farmhouse. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2401.86s)]
*  Like we didn't have a lot growing up, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2406.1800000000003s)]
*  but people constantly stopped by there, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2407.42s)]
*  specifically older people, seniors, and were like, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2410.3s)]
*  you know, they would cry. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2414.34s)]
*  They would just be standing on the front porch crying. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2416.1000000000004s)]
*  And I was like 10, like hiding behind my mom [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2417.82s)]
*  going like trying to eavesdrop and like, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2420.26s)]
*  what are they saying? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2422.06s)]
*  You know, that they had so many memories there [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2423.26s)]
*  and those handprints were there. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2425.1000000000004s)]
*  That's why I thought when I heard the song, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2426.7000000000003s)]
*  I was like, have they been eavesdropping on my whole life? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2427.98s)]
*  Because it was such an old farmhouse [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2431.1400000000003s)]
*  that had so many stories in it [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2432.58s)]
*  and it touched so many people's lives, you know? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2434.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2437.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's one thing that's amazing about art [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2438.7000000000003s)]
*  is that it can do that. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2440.86s)]
*  I mean, I think you could, it's just powerful, you know? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2443.26s)]
*  That the beats and the words [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2446.82s)]
*  and you put it all together the right way [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2448.9s)]
*  and it unlocks something. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2450.42s)]
*  It does. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2452.1s)]
*  And it's like, everybody feels like, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2452.94s)]
*  okay, I'm not alone in this world. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2455.62s)]
*  And this whatever's happening to me, good, bad, or ugly, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2456.98s)]
*  I'm not the only one. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2459.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2460.8199999999997s)]
*  That's the beauty of a song or any art, really, truly, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2461.66s)]
*  but especially songs. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2464.06s)]
*  I love, I'm in awe of songs. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2465.7s)]
*  I'm a songwriter, I'm a song lover, a music lover, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2469.3399999999997s)]
*  especially country ones, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2472.3399999999997s)]
*  because we just tell the sad truths no matter what. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2473.2599999999998s)]
*  Like you get in your feels, you know? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2476.4599999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2478.02s)]
*  So what do you listen to when you're wanting to like rage [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2479.3799999999997s)]
*  or like rock out or? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2483.14s)]
*  I mean, I'll put them before, well, I mean, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2484.58s)]
*  before I go on stage, I listen to FGL Dirt. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2486.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a little up tempo for me, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2490.42s)]
*  but it's also kind of chill. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2491.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and like down home and grounding. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2492.46s)]
*  And then I'll put on a little bit of Boosie Badass [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2494.58s)]
*  and listen to him, so I'll turn it the other way, you know? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2496.7799999999997s)]
*  I might even go some Sexy Red or something like that. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2499.54s)]
*  I don't go anything too crazy. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2502.5s)]
*  I mean, sometimes I'll put on maybe like Soundgarden [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2503.98s)]
*  or like, I've been listening to Stephen Wilson Jr. recently. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2507.22s)]
*  I'm obsessed with that record. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2512.46s)]
*  God, it's so good. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2514.38s)]
*  Golly, it's great. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2515.22s)]

*  You do? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2518.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2520.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh my God, what have you been away or? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2520.94s)]
*  I know. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2521.78s)]
*  It's like, I wrote with him and Natalie Hemby recently [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2522.6200000000003s)]
*  and we wrote this song called, well, the hook is, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2526.98s)]
*  I don't want to see the movie if the dog dies. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2530.0600000000004s)]
*  Like, all of us sitting there crying. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2532.6200000000003s)]
*  It was just like the most magical ride. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2534.6200000000003s)]
*  And it was Stephen's idea, obviously, shows up with that. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2536.6600000000003s)]
*  And my dogs were there and they're seniors. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2539.34s)]
*  I was like, oh God. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2540.9s)]
*  And they're scared. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2541.7400000000002s)]
*  They're like, hey, let's go finish the song. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2542.5800000000004s)]
*  No, he's so great. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2544.38s)]
*  I love it, but I also love it, said Soundgarden, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2545.9s)]

*  But yeah, it is, it's just interesting. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2580.82s)]
*  A song will get you activated or to get you ready [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2583.66s)]
*  for like a certain moment or something. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2586.18s)]

*  Did you ever have to or not? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2596.1s)]
*  Yeah, I had to sing at my grandma's [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2597.18s)]
*  and I had to sing at a friend that was like my age. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2599.14s)]
*  That was the worst one. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2601.66s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2602.86s)]
*  Was it the first thing you ever went to? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2603.7s)]
*  It was a car accident. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2604.54s)]
*  It was the first like reality check, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2605.38s)]
*  like teen years, high school friend. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2609.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2612.7400000000002s)]
*  And her family asked me to sing and I did, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2613.98s)]
*  but it was just one of the hardest things I've ever done. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2616.42s)]
*  I really, I know, I know. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2620.06s)]
*  So I, but you know when you're given a gift, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2623.02s)]
*  like what are you gonna say? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2627.5s)]
*  I'm not gonna use it to celebrate someone. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2628.46s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2630.5s)]
*  You have to do it. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2631.38s)]
*  Yeah, get on up there Miranda. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2632.2200000000003s)]

*  Yeah, man. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2636.7s)]
*  Oh, one time I was at a funeral [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2637.54s)]
*  and the person that sang, it was a girl, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2638.98s)]
*  and she was so nervous, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2642.58s)]
*  she started singing the Star Spangled Banner. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2643.46s)]
*  On accident? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2647.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2647.98s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2648.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, you shouldn't sing that. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2649.64s)]
*  Somebody had to go and kind of grab it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2650.48s)]
*  Hardly anyone should sing that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2651.98s)]
*  Hardly, let's just talk about it. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2653.8999999999996s)]
*  It's time to talk about it. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2655.5s)]
*  Especially if Kenny's right there in the casket [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2656.3399999999997s)]
*  and she's just like, whoo. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2657.8999999999996s)]
*  People were like, we can't even be here right now. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2660.06s)]
*  Honestly, there's like four people on earth [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2662.86s)]
*  that should sing that song, and that's it. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2665.5s)]
*  And she made it to like this, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2667.78s)]
*  and people waited, and some people started going like this. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2668.6600000000003s)]
*  No, no. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2670.9s)]
*  Yeah, because part of it is just you. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2672.2200000000003s)]
*  I just feel so uncomfortable right now. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2673.06s)]
*  I'm gonna go down those spiral stairs [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2674.98s)]
*  and leave forever right now. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2676.3s)]
*  Those only go up. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2678.34s)]
*  Just thinking about it. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2679.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, and yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2680.54s)]
*  They only go up. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2681.38s)]
*  A lot of us were like, what? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2682.2200000000003s)]
*  I thought, what happened? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2683.98s)]
*  He wasn't even in the service. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2685.98s)]
*  No. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2687.3s)]
*  The whole thing got really confusing, man. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2688.1400000000003s)]
*  I've been at some weird funerals. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2690.42s)]
*  My dad was 70 when I was born. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2691.7799999999997s)]
*  He was an older man. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2692.9799999999996s)]
*  And so he had to get me a suit for a funeral one time, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2693.8199999999997s)]
*  and it was around Halloween. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2698.2599999999998s)]
*  He got me a Beetlejuice costume. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2700.7799999999997s)]
*  Like the pinstripe. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2704.14s)]
*  And like a costume version, though. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2705.58s)]
*  I don't even know if it was real textiles. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2709.14s)]
*  Did they just think you were like, stylish? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2709.9799999999996s)]
*  I don't even know if it was real textiles or whatever. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2712.8999999999996s)]
*  But anyway, so I go to this funeral, dude, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2715.06s)]
*  in a dang Beetlejuice costume, bro. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2718.98s)]
*  And I guess it was kind of hip, I guess. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2722.38s)]
*  How old were you? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2724.66s)]
*  I was probably 11 or 12. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2725.82s)]
*  So like already awkward years, so that didn't help. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2727.58s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2729.86s)]
*  But you know, I guess that's what happens [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2731.7000000000003s)]
*  when you send a senior citizen to the, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2733.46s)]
*  it wasn't Rite Aid back then. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2735.82s)]
*  It was called KMB. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2736.94s)]
*  It was a store they had. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2737.78s)]
*  That had them a couple of costumes over there. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2739.5s)]
*  But God, it was, yeah, that was too much. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2741.34s)]
*  But yeah, anyway, funerals are a lot. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2744.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2747.46s)]
*  So sorry I brought that up. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2748.46s)]
*  I was like, I don't have anything to say to that. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2751.38s)]
*  Sorry about that, it seems terrible. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2753.3s)]
*  I heard a rumor that you got to meet Gypsy Rose [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2760.3s)]
*  when she was a Make-A-Wish kid. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2762.54s)]
*  Is that true? I did. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2763.82s)]

*  Like when all that came out, I was freaking out. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2786.74s)]
*  That's what I was wondering. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2788.14s)]
*  How did you feel? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2788.98s)]
*  Did somebody just tell you, oh my God, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2789.82s)]
*  do you see what just happened? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2791.62s)]

*  The whole thing was crazy. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2809.22s)]
*  That's what I'm just saying. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2810.38s)]
*  I can't even imagine how crazy it was. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2811.22s)]
*  Like it's something like that. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2813.42s)]
*  Cause you have these moments in your life. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2814.7s)]
*  You're being supportive of somebody. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2816.5s)]
*  They're dealing with a disease, a syndrome. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2817.78s)]
*  And then- [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2820.62s)]

*  You know, she was a baby child. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2825.1s)]
*  But didn't then suddenly it'd be like a national thing. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2826.78s)]
*  And you're like, what is going on? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2829.18s)]
*  I can't believe I was part of that, but I'm, you know, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2832.3s)]

*  Neither did she. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2836.34s)]
*  So it was just like, you know, her, I mean, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2837.1800000000003s)]
*  her mom worked the system and it worked. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2841.9s)]
*  Cause we have all met her, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2844.02s)]
*  like the whole country music community, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2844.98s)]
*  like ask any of us. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2846.9s)]
*  Oh, so she was part of it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2847.86s)]
*  She was in it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2849.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2849.86s)]
*  She was hobnobbing. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2850.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2851.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=2853.38s)]

*  You know that whole vibe where you learn a lot. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3366.02s)]
*  Early 30s were weird. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3369.94s)]
*  Late 30s were fine, but now I'm like, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3372.1s)]
*  we're doing right now. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3376.22s)]
*  You're like, we're here. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3377.14s)]
*  We're here. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3377.98s)]
*  Everybody's just like, 40s is the best decade. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3379.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm like, let's roll. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3381.22s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3382.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3383.34s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3384.18s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3385.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3386.38s)]
*  Tell me something else that you think about. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3388.54s)]
*  Oh, the new song is Damn It Randy on your new album. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3389.86s)]
*  Who's it about, man? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3393.98s)]
*  Well, it's about Randy. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3395.46s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3398.3s)]
*  It's about Randy. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3401.98s)]
*  Everybody has a Randy in their life. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3403.18s)]
*  And everybody has one. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3405.02s)]
*  And it's about just a time where I was like, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3406.86s)]
*  this is not good. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3409.74s)]
*  It's not serving me anymore. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3411.22s)]
*  This is, I gotta move on. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3412.46s)]
*  Was it serious or was it just somebody [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3415.94s)]
*  that didn't install y'all's cable well or something? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3417.3s)]
*  Well, it depends on the person. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3420.26s)]
*  Everybody's got a Randy. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3421.46s)]
*  Damn it, Randy. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3422.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3423.38s)]
*  And I wrote it with John Randall, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3424.22s)]
*  who's one of my besties, and his real name is Randy. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3425.06s)]
*  So I always say that to him anyway, so it's kind of funny. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3426.94s)]
*  And that's the one that Brendan's a writer on. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3430.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, I was flying a kite in the middle of a hurricane. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3432.5s)]
*  There it is, that little songwriter. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3435.18s)]
*  What else was I thinking about? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3438.34s)]
*  What drives you at this point in your career? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3441.34s)]
*  I know this is kind of a general question, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3443.22s)]
*  but you've gotten to have notoriety. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3444.5s)]
*  You've had number ones, you've won Grammys, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3449.2200000000003s)]
*  you've won, you're a household name. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3450.94s)]
*  You can afford to pay your rent. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3453.5s)]
*  It's like, what goals are there still for you? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3456.9s)]
*  Or do things evolve from goals into [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3461.38s)]
*  just wanting to still do the job? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3465.7s)]
*  I'm just curious, and it's stuff I go through [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3468.34s)]
*  in my own life too with comedy. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3469.86s)]
*  I'm just curious, what do you think about that? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3472.1s)]
*  You know, I'm lucky enough to have reached [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3475.1s)]
*  a lot of the goals that I set when I started this journey. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3478.62s)]
*  I mean, I was 17 when I was from Chasing Music, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3480.74s)]
*  so I'm doing... [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3482.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and people are like, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3483.62s)]
*  fuck, you'll be at a Dairy Queen in two months. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3485.14s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like, okay, see y'all next time. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3487.38s)]
*  Like, well, I'll be singing in the drive-through, dammit. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3489.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3491.9s)]
*  I don't know, I feel like now I'm just open. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3493.06s)]
*  I'm trying to be open to, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3496.22s)]
*  I'm not walking around saying, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3499.02s)]
*  I'm gonna do this and this and this. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3500.66s)]
*  I'm just absorbing what's around me [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3501.7s)]
*  and being open to new opportunities [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3504.7799999999997s)]
*  and meeting new people and [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3507.06s)]
*  also saying no to the right things. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3511.22s)]
*  Like, I think that's a big part of it [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3515.5s)]
*  because you can save your energy for the right things [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3517.54s)]
*  if you just say no to the things that are not right for you. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3520.2999999999997s)]
*  That's kind of where I'm headed [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3523.74s)]
*  and where I've been living in the past couple years. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3525.8199999999997s)]
*  Because I realize if you put all your energy [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3528.7799999999997s)]
*  into the wrong people and the wrong things, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3533.1s)]
*  then you don't have any openness or any time or energy left [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3535.38s)]
*  for the right things and then it's too late. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3538.02s)]
*  So I think I'm just in this space right now [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3540.34s)]
*  where I'm like, what's next? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3541.9s)]
*  I mean, this is new. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3543.7s)]
*  I've just started doing podcasts. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3544.66s)]
*  I've never done that before until this year. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3546.34s)]
*  You've done a good job on, I've watched some of them. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3548.54s)]
*  Well, I'm new to it and I'm not great at talking. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3550.46s)]
*  I'm a singer, I'm in front of people. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3554.02s)]
*  I'm actually an introverted extrovert. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3555.74s)]
*  I have an extroverted job with an introvert personality [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3558.06s)]
*  and so I'm branching in that way. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3560.78s)]
*  I'm fine to say my truths in songs. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3566.34s)]
*  It's just harder to do just saying it out there [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3568.46s)]
*  but I think it's important either way. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3571.66s)]
*  So I don't know, my goals are like, what's next? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3573.98s)]
*  Let's do something that scares us. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3577.1s)]
*  Let's do something that makes you grow and makes you learn. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3579.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's true. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3583.1s)]
*  Yeah, some of it's so weird. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3586.3s)]
*  I feel like when you're involved in some part of the arts [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3587.86s)]
*  kind of, people call them and some people just call them [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3591.46s)]
*  music and comedy and painting or whatever. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3593.86s)]
*  But it's weird to also kind of evolve [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3596.38s)]
*  because it's like you age, right? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3601.38s)]
*  We age and you're like, well, if I, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3603.98s)]
*  some songs I can't even really sing anymore. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3607.3s)]
*  Some jokes I can't even really, I could tell them still [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3609.2200000000003s)]
*  but is it really gonna be true to where I'm at? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3612.34s)]
*  I find that that's interesting about art itself [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3616.3s)]
*  is you have to, and then you're like, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3618.1s)]
*  but if I change, will I still have the people [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3620.5s)]
*  who liked this thing? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3622.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's like how do you keep the common thread [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3624.78s)]
*  and keep reinventing? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3626.6600000000003s)]
*  It's a tiny little fine line you have to walk. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3627.9s)]
*  And it's scary because what we do is very public [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3630.94s)]
*  and what we signed up for and what we started saying [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3634.42s)]
*  or the jokes we told at 20 or the songs we wrote at 20 [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3637.42s)]
*  are not the same, we're not in the same life space [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3641.1s)]
*  and we're not in the same place anymore. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3643.74s)]
*  So it's like figuring out how to do that gracefully [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3645.22s)]
*  but still keep that common thread of where you've been [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3650.8199999999997s)]
*  and where you're going but kind of walk this line [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3654.7799999999997s)]
*  of staying authentic to the true you [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3656.7s)]
*  that started this whole journey. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3660.14s)]
*  And comedy is the hardest thing in the world. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3661.8999999999996s)]
*  I think that would be the literal hardest part [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3663.9399999999996s)]
*  of the arts of any art, I really do. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3666.7799999999997s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3668.7s)]
*  Yeah, I just respect it because it's the most vulnerable. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3669.54s)]
*  Like standing up there in front of people [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3673.2599999999998s)]
*  and just telling jokes and hoping that it lands, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3674.7s)]
*  and there's no ban, it's just you. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3680.58s)]
*  Yeah, oh God, I wish somebody would pull up [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3683.06s)]
*  with a drum sometimes. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3685.22s)]
*  Just like ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3686.2999999999997s)]
*  Start playing a drum solo immediately [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3688.4199999999996s)]
*  if you're like no, this one didn't happen. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3689.8599999999997s)]
*  Take it away, Henry. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3692.1s)]
*  You know, you just turn it over to somebody. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3693.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have anybody to lean on up there [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3694.7s)]
*  by yourself emotionally naked, it's scary. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3696.74s)]
*  Oh, in the beginning it's so scary, I think. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3699.2999999999997s)]
*  God, I can't even believe something when you think back, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3701.66s)]
*  and I don't mean it like I'm not trying to feel my own ego, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3703.7s)]
*  but when you think back, I don't know if I'd go do it now, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3707.42s)]

*  You know what I do notice after touring [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3890.26s)]
*  and going to hotels and stuff, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3892.46s)]
*  I get one thing that bugs me now is [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3893.38s)]
*  if the mattress is too soft. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3896.66s)]
*  And I don't mean it in a negative way, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3898.82s)]
*  but it's like your back starts to fall apart [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3900.22s)]
*  and you start to realize how many bones you have [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3902.5s)]
*  in your body as you get older. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3904.06s)]

*  You figure out like, what like, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3909.7s)]
*  but is your continental breakfast just fruit loops [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3912.66s)]
*  or is it like hot breakfast? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3915.5s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3917.2999999999997s)]

*  on the road. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3920.02s)]
*  Like, do y'all have real eggs or are they powdered eggs? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3920.86s)]
*  Cause you can't say hot breakfast if it's powdered eggs. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3922.58s)]
*  That's just doesn't count. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3924.38s)]

*  You know, like the big, those zero ones, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3987.64s)]
*  you're like, I don't, I just would rather do nothing. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3989.48s)]
*  Like I shut down and she was, we were getting our hair done [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3991.36s)]
*  and she was like, it was typical getting your hair done [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3995.0s)]
*  in the foil. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3997.6s)]
*  So she's like, where do you want to turn 40? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3998.44s)]
*  And I was like, she was like, I feel like you want to turn [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=3999.7200000000003s)]
*  40 at home in Texas. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4002.04s)]
*  Go back to the route full circle. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4003.7200000000003s)]
*  And I was like, I do, I think. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4005.84s)]
*  And so Billy Bob's gave me the bar on a Monday [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4007.76s)]
*  cause they're closed. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4011.96s)]
*  And we had barbecue and a bunch of my Texas friends, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4013.44s)]
*  Randy Rogers and Wade Bowen and Adam Hood played. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4017.1200000000003s)]
*  And it was just a big old honky tonk night. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4019.98s)]
*  And it was like, it felt like, man, this is like why I loved [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4021.54s)]
*  why I started this in the first place. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4025.58s)]
*  Like I just, I've been playing Billy Bob's for so long [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4027.18s)]
*  and going there to see shows. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4029.9s)]
*  And so I think that was my favorite birthday so far. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4031.18s)]
*  That's perfect. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4034.46s)]
*  Well, that's the most recent one, you know? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4035.54s)]
*  What else was I thinking about anything in the news [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4039.78s)]
*  that we could think of? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4041.34s)]
*  We'll get you out of here soon too Miranda. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4042.9s)]
*  I know you guys have a show, you have a show tonight. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4044.26s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4046.3s)]
*  Tomorrow night. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4047.66s)]
*  Oh, tomorrow night. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4048.5s)]
*  Tomorrow night. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4049.34s)]
*  Yep, for singing for the doggies. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4050.98s)]
*  Oh, for your pups? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4053.02s)]
*  Music for Muts, yeah. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4053.86s)]
*  It's a benefit for Mutt Nation. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4055.34s)]
*  Music for Muts and what qualifies a Mutt actually? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4057.34s)]
*  Just us. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4060.7400000000002s)]
*  Probably, I don't know. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4066.06s)]
*  Like I have just rescue animals and like they're just all [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4068.7000000000003s)]
*  just mixed little puppers. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4072.78s)]
*  And I started a foundation in 2009 called [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4075.02s)]
*  Mutt Nation Foundation with my mom. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4077.7000000000003s)]
*  With your mom. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4078.7s)]
*  Yep, that's her. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4079.54s)]
*  And we've raised over $10 million since then. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4080.62s)]
*  $10 million? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4084.9s)]
*  $10 million. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4085.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4086.58s)]
*  We raise awareness for adoption, for spay neuter, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4087.4s)]
*  for adopt don't shop. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4089.74s)]
*  And like right now with the Hurricane Helene, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4090.74s)]
*  we're doing a lot of work with Tractor Supply Rescue Relief [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4092.62s)]
*  and with Greater Good to, you know, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4095.82s)]
*  people are first obviously, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4098.78s)]
*  but there's tons of shelters down there [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4099.9s)]
*  that were already overcrowded and got hit. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4101.58s)]
*  And so just, there's a lot of moving parts. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4104.1s)]
*  So really what our foundation does is kind of meet the need, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4106.9s)]
*  whatever the need is, you know, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4110.0199999999995s)]
*  whether it's lifting up shelters, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4111.62s)]
*  giving them grants for renovations, natural disasters, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4113.339999999999s)]
*  we kind of run the gamut, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4116.62s)]
*  but our main focus is to encourage people to adopt. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4117.96s)]
*  And once someone creates something like this, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4123.339999999999s)]
*  this foundation, right? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4125.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4126.94s)]
*  So this is a nonprofit organization. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4127.78s)]
*  How do you raise funds for it? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4130.299999999999s)]
*  Obviously you can do fundraiser shows, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4132.5s)]
*  you can put your own money into it. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4134.0599999999995s)]
*  And then how does, I'm just curious, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4135.98s)]
*  how does a nonprofit even, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4138.62s)]
*  well, I guess those are the ways you put money into it [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4140.0599999999995s)]
*  or you do fundraisers. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4142.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we've done fundraisers. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4143.0199999999995s)]
*  I sing for the pups. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4144.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, we haven't done a music one, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4145.94s)]
*  but like for my Vegas residency, we gave a dollar a ticket [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4147.9s)]
*  and I was there for two years. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4151.12s)]
*  So a dollar a ticket, we've done that on tour [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4152.74s)]
*  where a dollar a ticket goes to my nation. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4154.98s)]
*  And then this is our first benefit show in a couple of years. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4157.54s)]
*  So excited. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4159.78s)]
*  I got some friends coming out to sing, some surprises. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4160.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4163.58s)]
*  Yes, it'll be fun. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4164.419999999999s)]
*  Any of the animals ever tune in? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4165.28s)]
*  Any of them ever hit a B sharp or something? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4166.5599999999995s)]
*  And have you ever trained any? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4168.92s)]
*  No, my mom has this terrible shitty dog though. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4170.96s)]
*  His name is Rodie and he's just like my dad. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4173.8s)]
*  I know my dad found him on the side. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4176.28s)]
*  Was he held back in school? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4177.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4178.88s)]
*  And he has an underbite and he's a chowinny. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4179.86s)]
*  It's like the worst of all the world. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4181.92s)]
*  What is that? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4183.24s)]
*  And he's like my little shitty brother now. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4184.08s)]
*  And that's what she calls him. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4186.46s)]
*  Cause me and my brother, my real brother are like, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4187.5599999999995s)]
*  God, sibling of ours is terrible. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4189.32s)]
*  And he will sit there. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4192.36s)]
*  My dad plays guitar and writes songs. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4193.28s)]
*  It's specifically George Jones. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4195.92s)]
*  He's still loving her today. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4197.719999999999s)]
*  When dad starts singing that, that thing howls [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4198.639999999999s)]
*  and it's like this screeching awful noise. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4201.04s)]
*  And you have to put it away. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4204.28s)]
*  Like you have to put the dog in the house [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4206.04s)]
*  and it's still, you could hear it howling. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4207.28s)]
*  And then that part where they go, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4209.5199999999995s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4211.84s)]
*  That thing howls and it's just like, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4215.4s)]
*  and my parents think it's cute, which is even worse. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4216.92s)]
*  I know it's the worst. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4219.4s)]
*  So yeah, they could be some dogs thing. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4220.84s)]
*  Do you want them to? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4223.76s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4224.6s)]
*  But if you could organize them. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4226.28s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4228.64s)]
*  We can do like a family choir. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4229.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4231.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4232.56s)]
*  Get you a little batch of hounds [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4233.400000000001s)]
*  in those church gowns or whatever. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4234.24s)]
*  Yeah, we could do it. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4237.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, anything can be done. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4238.68s)]
*  We could ask Chad. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4241.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4242.24s)]
*  Chad will do it. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4243.08s)]
*  Ask Chad GPT. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4243.900000000001s)]
*  Hey, organize these mutts guys. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4244.74s)]
*  Was there two pieces of news? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4248.2s)]
*  Anything else in the news? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4249.2s)]
*  I think these are the top two news stories [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4250.08s)]
*  that we had in there. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4251.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4254.0s)]
*  This is a, and we don't have to talk about this either [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4254.84s)]
*  if you don't, if it's an awkward thing. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4256.56s)]
*  Yeah, Garth Brooks got accused of harassment. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4257.96s)]
*  Did you ever know him as a bad guy? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4259.8s)]
*  I always heard the nicest things about him. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4261.0s)]
*  I don't know him. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4262.56s)]
*  I just heard this today. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4264.12s)]

*  I'm sorry. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4541.12s)]
*  It was. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4541.96s)]
*  You believe it though that we did not do that on purpose? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4543.679999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4545.24s)]
*  We just manifested all of that. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4547.48s)]
*  I would never do that on purpose. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4549.04s)]
*  We're Cryin' Lovin' ain't Leavin' now, bye. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4549.88s)]
*  Leavin'. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4553.2s)]
*  Okay, that's what it is. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4554.04s)]
*  Don't lift. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4554.88s)]
*  Yeah, all three. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4555.72s)]
*  We need to do a new spin-off of it. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4557.24s)]
*  They should have it. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4559.48s)]
*  Wonder if Kix Brooks does something like that. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4560.72s)]
*  Cause I know he has a weekly show or something. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4562.12s)]
*  But that was it. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4564.2s)]
*  When you were a kid waiting to hear [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4565.88s)]
*  if somebody was crying, loving, or leaving, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4566.68s)]
*  you didn't even know. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4568.44s)]
*  I wanna listen to these, not that one particular. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4569.28s)]
*  Where people were. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4571.24s)]
*  If they did that on purpose, I'm sorry. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4572.84s)]
*  I don't think they would do that. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4574.68s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4576.04s)]
*  They're two nicer guys to actually do that. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4577.72s)]
*  About the new album, what else, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4581.92s)]
*  what's new about it? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4583.48s)]
*  What feels new to you about it? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4584.96s)]
*  Obviously you have new tunes and that sort of thing. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4586.2s)]
*  But yeah, what feels exciting to you about it? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4590.68s)]
*  Or anything different? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4593.08s)]
*  Well, I made it in Texas. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4595.72s)]
*  It's the first time I've recorded in Texas since I was 18. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4596.72s)]
*  Okay, so back to your roots, kinda? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4599.32s)]
*  Back to the roots, yeah. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4601.0s)]
*  I wanted to go to Austin and just like, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4601.84s)]
*  really, it's a really honky tonk record. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4603.88s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like my childhood. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4606.12s)]
*  It sounds like the music I grew up on. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4607.68s)]
*  And I think it's just because I have a new chapter, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4609.76s)]
*  a new label, a new decade ahead of me [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4611.76s)]
*  of like, whatever's gonna happen. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4615.5199999999995s)]
*  And I wanted to like, go back to the root [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4617.84s)]
*  of where the whole passion started to begin with, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4621.08s)]
*  which was like playing those honky tonks in Texas. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4623.16s)]
*  I think I had that sort of awakening [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4625.92s)]
*  when I had my birthday at Billy Bob's. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4628.08s)]
*  And I was like, I'm turning 40, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4630.12s)]
*  one of my favorite places on earth, in my home state, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4631.08s)]
*  and honky tonk listening to country music. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4633.72s)]
*  And that's just where my heart lives at the end of the day, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4635.4s)]
*  is a honky tonk listening to country music. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4638.16s)]
*  So it felt right to like, make my own music that way, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4640.48s)]
*  this time, you know? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4644.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard for your heart to kinda get back home [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4645.88s)]
*  when your life gets busy like that in a way, you know? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4647.76s)]
*  It is, and I have a house in Austin. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4649.96s)]
*  I spend a lot of time in Austin. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4651.6s)]
*  I love Austin. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4652.92s)]
*  Me too, my little brother lives there. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4653.76s)]
*  And I just, I don't know. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4655.12s)]
*  I always say I'm a TNT state girl [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4657.72s)]
*  because my heart's half in Tennessee, half in Texas. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4661.72s)]
*  But both places that I live revolve around music, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4665.36s)]
*  and I love that. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4668.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's like sometimes your life gets so busy [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4669.32s)]
*  and then you're like, it stops at a certain point [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4670.84s)]
*  of there's a special day or a moment, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4674.16s)]
*  you're like, okay, I can get a look at where I'm at. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4675.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to have enough time to stop [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4678.4s)]
*  and look at where you're at because I didn't for so long. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4681.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, when you're young and you start young, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4684.36s)]
*  following your dream, and then you just sorta [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4686.839999999999s)]
*  are a horse with blinders, then you stop and you go, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4690.36s)]
*  okay, now what? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4693.96s)]
*  I made it, now what? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4695.799999999999s)]
*  You know, and it's like, it's kind of a weird spot to be, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4697.04s)]
*  but then once you embrace it, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4701.16s)]
*  which is where I feel like I am right now, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4702.879999999999s)]
*  just embracing what I've done so far, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4704.24s)]
*  but what else can we do? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4708.44s)]
*  Still feel really inspired and excited. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4710.8s)]
*  I mean, I definitely don't have the same energy [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4712.639999999999s)]
*  for long 150 dates a year on the road or anything, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4715.84s)]
*  but I'm still so inspired to write songs. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4719.88s)]
*  I love the music, I can't, it's my life. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4724.36s)]
*  I dedicated my whole life to it. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4726.639999999999s)]
*  It is funny, you do, when you get busy [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4729.2s)]
*  and your career gets busy, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4731.44s)]
*  a lot of you gets dedicated to what it is. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4733.04s)]
*  It's like, I spend most of my time, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4734.92s)]
*  like I have some close friends [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4737.6s)]
*  I don't even get to talk to that much, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4739.16s)]
*  and I know it's sad to say, people are like, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4740.96s)]
*  well, you work instead of talk to them, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4742.8s)]
*  but it's almost like you build up your dream, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4744.84s)]
*  but then your dream takes a lot of responsibility. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4747.28s)]
*  Yeah, and nobody tells you what to do [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4749.52s)]
*  when you have done it. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4752.2s)]
*  Like, there's not like a manual you can, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4754.32s)]
*  like there's not like a podcast you can like go back [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4757.12s)]
*  and look at and be like, so now what happens [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4760.04s)]
*  at this point in my career at this age [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4761.8s)]
*  with these accolades, like what happens now? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4763.4400000000005s)]
*  You just figure it out as you go. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4766.12s)]
*  And you know, like working with younger artists now [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4767.84s)]
*  and like newer artists have a label called Big Loud Texas. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4772.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4775.6s)]
*  The partnership with Big Loud and. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4776.4400000000005s)]

*  It's hillbilly and it's rage and it's sad and it's funny. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4815.88s)]
*  And even as a native American, some of the beats, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4819.92s)]
*  some of the drums that he uses have a very like [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PedmJ4pmXHs&t=4822.16s)]
