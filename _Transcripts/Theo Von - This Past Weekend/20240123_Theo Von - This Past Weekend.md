Video Description: Dr. Jeffrey Long is a physician, author and researcher of near-death experiences. His book “Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences” is a New York Times Best-Seller that compiles research from more than 1,600 cases and interviews. Outside of his research he is a practicing Oncologist in Kentucky. 

Dr. Jeffrey Long joins Theo to talk about the phenomena of near-death experiences, what’s really going on in our minds when we come close to the end, what people claim to see in their visions, why he believes there’s an afterlife based on his research, and what we can learn from these experiences to get the most out of life.

# Near-Death Experience Expert Dr. Jeffrey Long  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #479
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg)
*  Today's guest is a practicing physician. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=0.0s)]
*  He's an author and he's a researcher into the phenomenon of near-death experiences. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4.0s)]
*  He has done the largest case study, over 5,000 cases of near-death experiences, and he wrote [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=10.52s)]
*  the book, Evidence of the Afterlife, the Science of Near-Death Experiences, which is a New York [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=17.44s)]
*  Times bestseller. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=23.14s)]
*  I'm grateful to be able to spend time with him today and get to learn about what's right [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=26.52s)]
*  on the cusp of the afterlife. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=32.48s)]
*  Today's guest is Dr. Jeffrey Long. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=34.28s)]
*  I'm sitting here with Dr. Jeffrey Long, and you had the New York Times bestseller, like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=56.52s)]
*  you were just saying, the Evidence of the Afterlife, the Science of Near-Death Experiences. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=70.2s)]
*  That term is fascinating to people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=76.16s)]
*  You hear near-death, it's like, because that's where everybody's so afraid of that line, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=77.76s)]
*  and the finality of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  I want to start by asking, what quantifies near-death experience? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=90.44s)]
*  Now, different researchers have different concepts, but the research definition that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=91.44s)]
*  I've always used is exactly what the name implies. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=95.88s)]
*  You're near-death. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=99.56s)]
*  In other words, you're so physically compromised, you're unconscious, or you may be clinically [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=100.56s)]
*  dead with absent heartbeat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=105.22s)]
*  Now, at that time, it should be impossible to have any lucid, conscious remembrance, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=106.76s)]
*  and yet people do have that remembrance at that time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=112.04s)]
*  And that's the experience part of a near-death experience. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=115.84s)]
*  Okay, and why is it at that time that you shouldn't be able to have any lucid brain [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  activity? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=124.04s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=125.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=126.04s)]
*  Let's talk about what happens to the brain after a cardiac arrest, which means the heart [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=127.04s)]
*  stops beating. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=130.04s)]
*  The moment the heart stops beating, Theo, obviously, blood immediately stops flowing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=131.54s)]
*  to the brain. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=136.52s)]
*  10 to 20 seconds after that event, the EEG, which is electroencephalogram, a measure of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=137.52s)]
*  brain electrical activity, goes absolutely flat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  There's no measurable cortical brain activity. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=148.0s)]
*  20 seconds after the heart stops. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=150.16s)]
*  After the heart stops and after blood stops going to the brain. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=151.84s)]
*  It should be impossible to have any remembrance at that time, let alone the highly lucid and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  organized near-death experience. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=160.0s)]
*  So you started to kind of quantify or collect the experiences people were having at that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  point? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=168.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=169.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=170.48s)]
*  I've been researching and gathering near-death experiences for over 25 years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=171.48s)]
*  I was so fascinated when I first heard about near-death experiences that I really wanted [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  to study them, but with the best methodology possible. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  And that being people that actually had near-death experiences sharing their first-person experience. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=185.0s)]
*  So over 25 years ago, I established the Near-Death Experience Research Foundation, a research [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=190.92s)]
*  website which encouraged people to share a narrative of their experience, but also had [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  a scientifically designed huge number of questions actually as a survey so that not only were [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=202.84s)]
*  we getting large numbers of near-death experiences, but we were learning about them from all those [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  survey questions at a depth that hereto forward been impossible. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=212.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=216.52s)]
*  So you create a website where people would go that had had near-death experiences and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=217.52s)]
*  they would start to just list out the information, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=222.0s)]
*  What were some of the questions that you would ask to somebody? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=225.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=229.08s)]
*  Well first, of course, we have them give the narrative of their experience. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=230.08s)]
*  We don't want any leading questions prior to that time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=232.72s)]
*  But then once we start, and currently the website survey has over 80 different questions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  Some of the questions include the leading research tool called the NDE Scale, which [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=242.12s)]
*  is a series of 16 questions that are sort of different degrees of expressing that particular [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=246.96s)]
*  element or not expressing it at all. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=254.04s)]
*  But in addition to that, we have dozens of other questions that help establish basically [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=256.48s)]
*  demographic questions, male, female, where do you live, when did the experience occur, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=262.12s)]
*  also content questions, which is a very strong focus of the survey. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=267.52s)]
*  And then finally, importantly, after effects, how did their life change after that? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=271.72s)]
*  How did their life change in response to that amazing near-death experience? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=276.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=280.8s)]
*  25 years ago, you start the website, people start reporting what's happening, you start [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=281.88s)]
*  collecting this data. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=287.2s)]
*  Were you surprised at the number of people? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=288.56s)]
*  Were you like, yeah, what are some things that kind of shocked you out of the gate? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=290.2s)]
*  Right off the bat, I realized there was overwhelming consistency even in the first few dozen near-death [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=294.36s)]
*  experiences I saw. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=299.32s)]
*  Everything I knew as a physician told me, this is not possible. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=301.5s)]
*  You can't have highly lucid conscious experiences when you're unconscious or clinically dead. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=304.88s)]
*  And yet here, the very first few dozens of people sharing with me very clearly, and what [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=311.68s)]
*  was very impressive is the remarkable consistency of the elements they were describing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=316.32s)]
*  What happened during the experience, the elements, or if you will, characteristics, not only [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  were they very consistently seen across many, many near-death experiences, but they typically [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  occurred in a very consistent and logical order. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=331.64s)]
*  This is nothing like dreams or hallucinations or any other type of pathologically altered [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=334.66s)]
*  consciousness. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=339.52s)]
*  I realized very, very quickly, and as I was to learn even more and more with, I got more [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  and more experiences shared with me, near-death experiences are, in a word, real. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=345.4s)]
*  What were some of the things that made you, that led you to believe that they were real? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=350.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=353.24s)]
*  The overwhelming consistency. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=354.24s)]
*  Now, while no two near-death experiences are the same, if you study a lot of them, and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=355.24s)]
*  Theo, I've studied over 4,000. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=359.96s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=362.24s)]
*  So with that huge data set, I... [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=363.24s)]
*  Really loitering around there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's kept me busy with my second full-time job. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  St. Peter over here milling around. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough to be a full-time doctor, which I'm trying to do while doing that as [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=373.44s)]
*  my other full-time job. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  But what I have observed and other near-death experience researchers see is that very consistent [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=379.04s)]
*  pattern of what happens when you have a near-death experience. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=384.88s)]
*  Well, of course, there's that life-threatening event, they're unconscious or clinically dead, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=387.68s)]
*  no heartbeat. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  But at that time, a very common first element is what's called an out-of-body experience. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  So consciousness separates from the physical body and goes above the body. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  Now, from that vantage point, they can see ongoing earthly events, often including people [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  frantically trying to bring them back to life. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=407.32000000000005s)]
*  They may then go into or through a tunnel, variably described, often at the end of the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  tunnel. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=414.8s)]
*  There's a beautiful unearthly, they emphasize, light. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=415.8s)]
*  In that, after passing through the tunnel, then at that time, they may be in an unearthly, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=419.72s)]
*  what some call a heavenly realm, aptly described. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=424.92s)]
*  It's very different from what we've known everywhere on our earthly life. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=428.32s)]
*  It's literally a non-physical realm, movement is non-physical, communication is essentially [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=432.6s)]
*  always telepathic. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=437.52s)]
*  Time is almost invariably described as either radically different from earthly time or not [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=440.0s)]
*  existing at all. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=445.48s)]
*  In this realm, this unearthly, beautiful, heavenly realm, there can be encounters with [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=447.08s)]
*  deceased loved ones, there can be a review of a part or all of their prior life called [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=451.54s)]
*  a life review. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=456.2s)]
*  At this point, they can be colors like in plants and landscape that are so beautiful [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  that there are no earthly words that they have to describe them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=463.92s)]
*  There can be buildings. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=467.3s)]
*  Around this time, there's often a decision that they make as they interact with other [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=469.24s)]
*  beings about whether to stay in this beautiful unearthly realm or return to their earthly [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=472.6s)]
*  life and that body struggling to survive. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=477.68s)]
*  Okay, so those are the most common characteristics of the near-death experiences. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=480.16s)]
*  What would be your strongest evidence that this actually happens? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=485.76s)]
*  Anybody can go on a website and fill it out. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=490.04s)]
*  Sure, there's been a ton of people that have done it, but what's the most common evidence [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=493.96s)]
*  that you believe that this has happened? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=498.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=500.64s)]
*  Theo, we talked earlier about that out-of-body experience where consciousness goes above [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=501.64s)]
*  the body, above the unconscious or comatose physical body below. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=506.24s)]
*  What I and other researchers have investigated is how accurate are those observations in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  that out-of-body state? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  And amazingly, in my study, over 98% of what people are seeing and hearing with their physical [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  body unconscious down below is accurate down to the finest detail. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=523.28s)]
*  And in fact, they can make these observations in that out-of-body state geographically [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=528.12s)]
*  far from their physical body, far outside of any possible physical sensory awareness. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=533.1s)]
*  What do you mean when you say that? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=539.56s)]
*  Before you get to the example, I got confused there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=545.88s)]
*  We had one relatively recent near-death experience. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=548.5999999999999s)]
*  Lady was riding a horse and was out basically breaking in the horse and the horse threw [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  her off and she hit her head. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=556.56s)]
*  Very severe head injury, immediately unconscious. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=558.68s)]
*  She had that out-of-body experience, consciousness above her body, saw her body lying on the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=562.16s)]
*  ground, saw the horse heading back to home, but then her consciousness went to where she [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=566.96s)]
*  had started prior to her journey. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=572.4s)]
*  The barn, and she was able to hear other people talking, aware of what they were saying, doing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=574.56s)]
*  They didn't know that she was fighting for her life over a mile away because they weren't [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=580.32s)]
*  aware of that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=585.0s)]
*  They only were aware of that when the horse arrived without her. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=586.0s)]
*  And again, she was able to see and bring back all that information, verified down to the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=588.72s)]
*  finest details of what she was seeing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=594.12s)]
*  In a mile away, obviously, there's no way you're going to see, hear, or perceive in [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=596.08s)]
*  any way with your normal sensory function. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=601.2s)]
*  And so that's a common thing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=604.72s)]
*  People like, so hovering kind of outside of themselves, so people leaving their physical [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=606.0s)]
*  realm, right? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=610.48s)]
*  You leave you, and I guess do they feel okay being away from themselves? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=611.48s)]
*  Do they feel like jeepers? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=617.24s)]
*  I got to get back into myself. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  Like when you lost your phone or something, you know? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=620.32s)]
*  Or does it feel like that's what I would be like, gosh, because if I'm just milling around, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=622.72s)]
*  it's almost like you're just naked, like you're as naked as you could be. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=627.76s)]
*  You're naked down to your soul. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=630.64s)]
*  You know, that's a good assumption. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=632.64s)]
*  And I kind of wondered about that too early in my research. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=634.1999999999999s)]
*  But amazingly, even though these people are unconscious or clinically dead and may have [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=637.68s)]
*  had severe trauma or illness problems that led to that episode of unconsciousness, when [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=642.8s)]
*  that consciousness separates from their physical body, they essentially never describe any [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=649.12s)]
*  pain. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=653.72s)]
*  It's unusual for them to feel fear about consciousness apart from their body. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=655.32s)]
*  Far more commonly described is a sense of calm, a sense of peace, a sense, amazingly, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=659.52s)]
*  that this is actually their real conscious self, that being non-physical and apart from [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=665.4000000000001s)]
*  their body down below. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=671.12s)]
*  Ah, so that's a common thing that people say, oh, this felt, that felt a lot more real than [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=673.08s)]
*  the existence I'd been having in my body. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=678.6s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=681.0s)]
*  In fact, we have a survey question and we asked people about what they ultimately decided [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=682.0s)]
*  about the reality of their experience. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  And in our survey of 834 people that had a near-death experience, where we asked that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=692.64s)]
*  question, 93.8% said their experience was definitely real. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=697.28s)]
*  And over and over as part of that, they were saying it was more real than anything they'd [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=701.9s)]
*  known in their earthly life. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=706.7s)]
*  They typically have acceleration of consciousness. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=708.12s)]
*  Amazingly, the substantial majority, even though they're physically unconscious or clinically [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=711.08s)]
*  dead, are actually thinking, processing at a speed they simply couldn't have done in [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=716.12s)]
*  their earthly life. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=721.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=722.72s)]
*  A good example of that is we talked briefly about the life review. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=723.72s)]
*  I mean, just imagine that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=727.52s)]
*  Here you are unconscious or clinically dead, and yet about a fifth of people have a life [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=728.98s)]
*  see part or even all of their prior life. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=735.16s)]
*  Here they are unconscious just for often minutes, certainly, you know, less than 30 minutes [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  almost always. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=743.68s)]
*  And yet, at that time, they're reliving, viewing all that went on in their prior life. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=744.8399999999999s)]
*  An amazing demonstration of just how rapid consciousness can be during a near-death experience. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=750.8399999999999s)]
*  So that's one, you said one out of five people had that? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=756.38s)]
*  Yeah, life review. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=758.56s)]
*  Okay, and a life review. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=759.56s)]
*  I think that makes sense because the brain is like the ultimate function of the brain [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  is to organize. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=764.8s)]
*  And I feel like a lot of times, I guess it would make sense if your brain is worried [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  that it's going to shut down. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=774.0s)]
*  It's still trying to like, it would almost show, it almost seems like, say if it's trying [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=775.0s)]
*  to prove at the last second, hey, what I've been doing makes sense. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=781.3199999999999s)]
*  Here's my work. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=785.8399999999999s)]
*  It's almost like you're trying to show your professor like, look, I have the beginning. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=786.8399999999999s)]
*  I have the next. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=788.5999999999999s)]
*  I have this. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=789.64s)]
*  I have this. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=790.64s)]
*  I have this. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=791.64s)]
*  I have this. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=792.64s)]
*  I have this. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=793.64s)]
*  I have this. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=794.64s)]
*  Doesn't this check out? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=795.64s)]
*  Because does that make any sense thinking like that? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=796.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=797.64s)]
*  That's how I thought for a long time going into my near-death experience research. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=798.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=799.64s)]
*  I assumed, as I think most people would rationally assume, that near-death experiences had to [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=800.64s)]
*  be due to physical brain function because Theo, that's how we think. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  That's how we live our life. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=808.16s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're used to. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=809.24s)]
*  We haven't really, in general, had any particular experience of consciousness or awareness that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=810.66s)]
*  wasn't part of our physical brain. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=816.48s)]
*  that is the amazing thing about near-death experiences. During the life [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=818.12s)]
*  review, it's not a matter of them using their physical brain. It's like that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=822.84s)]
*  consciousness apart from the body where they're seeing and hearing things. Theo, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=826.8s)]
*  you can't possibly do that with normal physical sensory awareness, and in fact, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=830.36s)]
*  we have scores and scores of near-death experiences that had their [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=834.6s)]
*  life-threatening event, typically their heart stopping, while they [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=838.72s)]
*  were under general anesthesia. Now under that blanket of sleep, it should be, and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=842.72s)]
*  as many of you know that have been under general anesthesia, I mean the brain just [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=847.24s)]
*  shuts off. There's no possible remembrance at all, and at that time, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=851.4000000000001s)]
*  they're carefully monitoring vital signs. I know I've been there. I'm a doctor. I've [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=855.6s)]
*  seen that. Do a lot of people wake up and say something racial sometimes? I've done that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=859.36s)]
*  before. I can honestly say I haven't ever done that. I've heard of [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=863.5200000000001s)]
*  people waking up and having with altered brains some bizarre [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=868.9200000000001s)]
*  conversations with the anesthesia team, and ask any anesthesiologist. They'll [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=873.16s)]
*  have all sorts of stories like that, by the way, as a bit of an aside, but getting [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=877.3199999999999s)]
*  back to that cardiac arrest, heart stopping, while under general anesthesia, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=881.48s)]
*  Theo, it should be doubly impossible for the physical brain to produce any kind [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=885.8s)]
*  of awareness or experience, and yet from being under anesthesia, it [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=890.6s)]
*  should be completely impossible scientifically for the brain to recall [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=894.8s)]
*  anything. Absolutely, and yet at that time by the scores, me and other near-death [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=899.24s)]
*  experience researchers are finding that they do have near-death experiences, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  typical near-death experiences like all others. So that is, if you will, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=909.08s)]
*  doubly impossible that that could be due to the physical brain function. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=913.24s)]
*  Okay, so how do you know something is not just a dream? I'm trying to think of another word for a dream, but I don't know another word for it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=917.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well that's a good one. I mean, in all of our lives we typically have dreams. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=925.56s)]
*  That's very common. Near-death experiences are nothing like dreams. Theo, at the risk [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  of embarrassment, I'm going to share with you how I found out about that. At the very [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=935.76s)]
*  dawn of putting a survey up on the website, I asked the question, was your [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=939.8s)]
*  experience dream-like in any way? And oh, I was embarrassed at the responses. No way, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=943.76s)]
*  no chance, absolutely not. Emphatic over and over again for people having [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=949.84s)]
*  near-death experiences, emphasizing this had nothing to do with dreams. So I [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=955.4s)]
*  quickly let go of that line of questioning. So again, you know, when you [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  hear about a near-death experience that seems so unearthly, people normally would [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=963.68s)]
*  think, gosh, isn't that like a dream that I'm familiar with? Yeah. Nothing, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=967.84s)]
*  absolutely nothing like a dream. It's far more lucid and conscious. A dream, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=972.64s)]
*  Theo, typically events may skip around in an illogical order. Yeah, it's almost like [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=978.1999999999999s)]
*  that movie Gummo, Connie, you ever seen that? I've heard of it. Yeah, I haven't seen it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=983.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's, I mean, it's, it is what it is. But yeah, it's like [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=987.08s)]
*  somebody, it's like, it's like, because somebody made a collage. Dreams are [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=990.96s)]
*  sometimes for like a collage. I love that. That's a great way to look at it. You're [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=994.32s)]
*  typically less lucid, less conscious than earthly everyday life. Events in the [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  dreams skip around because, well, they're like dreams. You're hanging with your [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1004.36s)]
*  buddy, then you got a snake, and then you look inside of a window, and then [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1008.72s)]
*  everybody hates you, you know, and then you have to go home because you did [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1011.72s)]
*  something. We've all been there, Theo. So you're right. That's nothing like near [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1014.36s)]
*  death experiences. While it's a different type of altered consciousness, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  it's actually a hyper lucid consciousness. Which is interesting when you say that, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1023.64s)]
*  because like whenever I, so, and I don't want to like just equate this to [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1027.56s)]
*  ayahuasca, right? But I've done drugs in my life, you know, and you know, have you [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1031.56s)]
*  ever done any? No, I don't want to say anything. No, I actually haven't. You haven't? Yeah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1036.68s)]
*  No. Oh, um, yeah. And that's okay, right? And some people do them and some people [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1041.28s)]
*  don't. And, but when I went and did ayahuasca, it was not like doing a drug. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  People were like, do you get messed up? You know, it's like, no, dude, it is a [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  intense, emotional bootcamp where like you're like, you almost, your thoughts [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1055.36s)]
*  suddenly have a response to them in a way. Like suddenly you're like, the world [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1068.04s)]
*  thinks back at you. That's what it feels like kind of. I never really was able to [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1075.8s)]
*  think about it, but the world, you can feel the world literally thinking back at [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1079.32s)]
*  you and reflecting. So you get so much, there's a lot of, um, uh, like solving of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1083.8s)]
*  problems because you're not just wondering and putting things out in there [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1091.6399999999999s)]
*  and waiting for you to solve them. It feels like nature or the world or God or a [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1095.24s)]
*  higher entity or a collective entity or energy meets you halfway and helps you [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1100.76s)]
*  work like in real time. And it's a very loving, helpful, um, entity or energy, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1107.32s)]
*  even though it can take you through some moments that feel challenging, it feels [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1114.1200000000001s)]
*  like extremely cathartic and helpful. Um, so that's one of the things that made me [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1119.24s)]
*  fascinated when I started hearing about, uh, some of your work, I was like, oh, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1126.2s)]
*  this is so, I wonder how much of this is similar to some of the experience that I [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1129.0s)]
*  had on Ayahuasca. And I wonder what, just what people's experiences are like, you [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1133.96s)]
*  know? Well, I can address that. Okay. Um, I co-authored a paper that was published [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1138.2s)]
*  in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences and the lead researcher [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1143.48s)]
*  investigated the published medical literature about a wide variety of what we call [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1148.12s)]
*  psychotropic or brain acting drugs and looked at the descriptions of these experiences and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1153.08s)]
*  compared it to near death experiences. And the conclusion of this study, really radically [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1159.0s)]
*  different experiences between psychotropic drugs and near death experiences. But above [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1165.08s)]
*  and beyond that, Theo, for anybody listening or viewing this, you can find out for yourself. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1171.32s)]
*  There's a website called Arrowid, E-R-O-W-I-D dot org. Arrowid? Arrowid dot org has thousands [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1177.4s)]
*  of first person shared experiences with psychotropic drugs. It is amazing how many they [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1184.6000000000001s)]
*  have. You can look up any type of psychotropic drug. You can look up Ayahuasca experiences. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1191.4s)]
*  Arrowid, E-R-O-W-I-D documenting the complex relationship between humans and psychoactives. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1196.76s)]
*  They have thousands of experience. It is by far the best resource for anybody that would like to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1203.1599999999999s)]
*  compare near death experiences and what happens in near death experiences with psychotropic drugs. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1209.1599999999999s)]
*  Go there. You can look up Ayahuasca. You can look up DMT. You can look up LSD. There are literally [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1215.4799999999998s)]
*  hundreds of examples of virtually all of these psychotropic drugs. I've done that and very [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1222.04s)]
*  quickly you'll realize, as I have and others do that go through that exercise, that the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1228.36s)]
*  psychotropic drug experiences from shared by people that actually had them are in general [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1233.56s)]
*  radically different for what happens in a near death experience. They're more hallucinatory. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1239.7199999999998s)]
*  They're more often frightening. They're more often dreamlike in a sense that events can skip around. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1244.12s)]
*  All you have to do is read 10 Ayahuasca, especially 20 Ayahuasca experiences from that source and read [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1249.6399999999999s)]
*  10 or 20 near death experiences and it jumps out at you immediately the contrast. Finally, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1257.72s)]
*  when we have our survey, people will often share when they have a near death experience [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1263.24s)]
*  that they've also tried psychotropic drugs. In general, they will state from the source, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1268.52s)]
*  people that had both near death experiences and psychotropic drug experiences, that the [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1274.68s)]
*  two experiences are radically different. The near death experience is grippingly real. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1279.08s)]
*  The psychotropic drugs are tending to be not real. That's what you'd expect with a [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1284.84s)]
*  hallucinatory experience. Damn dude, you make me want to, I want to have a damn near death experience. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1290.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh well, I tell you what, and I want to emphasize that a lot of people hear about the near death [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1294.52s)]
*  experiences and go, wow, I got to go get me some of that. And we have to give, I'm going to give a [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1299.24s)]
*  cautionary note to you and I think this is important. Some people hear about near death experiences and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1304.84s)]
*  tragically a few people will actually do something risky with their lives, you know, up to even [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1310.44s)]
*  considering suicide. I think it's, I want to emphasize that people that have had near death [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1315.3200000000002s)]
*  experiences as a result of suicide attempts learn almost uniformly during their near death experience [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1320.2s)]
*  that that suicide attempt was a huge mistake. Virtually everyone that has a near death experience [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1326.3600000000001s)]
*  as a result of an effort at suicide and then recovers will almost never attempt suicide again. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1332.68s)]
*  And why? Because they understand life is meaningful, life is important, they're here for a reason, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1338.84s)]
*  even if their life is extraordinarily difficult. And by the way, if you commit suicide and don't [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1344.6s)]
*  have a near death experience, you're much more likely, unfortunately, to attempt suicide again [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1351.1599999999999s)]
*  at some future time. Wow, really? Yeah. Well also, if you're listening, you didn't commit suicide. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1356.04s)]
*  That's a good point. You know, like no judgment to anybody that gave it a run or whatever, you know, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1361.8s)]
*  we're glad you're no good at it. Okay, that's good. Yeah, you didn't do it. Did people that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1366.76s)]
*  tried suicide, did a lot of them have near death experiences? Well, I guess they did because they [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1371.56s)]
*  tried suicide, but that's a physical act of it. Yeah. Well, and that's a good question, Theo. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1375.72s)]
*  First of all, I want to point out that of people that have a life-threatening event, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1381.0s)]
*  only about 10 to 20% of them will actually have a near death experience. 80 or 90% don't. So you're [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1385.72s)]
*  saying if somebody falls off a cliff, somebody, you know, falls into like a butter churn or [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1392.04s)]
*  something, or somebody gets hacked by somebody, somebody gets beaten, hit by train, whatever, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1397.3999999999999s)]
*  domestic dispute, heavy domestic dispute, and something happens to them, you're saying [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1401.3999999999999s)]
*  only a small percentage of those will have then within their unconsciousness, then have a near [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1407.0s)]
*  death experience. Right. Does it matter how you get into unconsciousness on whether or not you [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1411.8799999999999s)]
*  have a near death experience? No, it doesn't make any difference what that life-threatening event [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1416.44s)]
*  was as to whether you have a near death experience. In fact, the only good research study found the [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1421.24s)]
*  closer to death you are, the more likely you are to have a near death experience. Wow. So you got [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1426.44s)]
*  to walk over there, huh? Yeah, it's kind of interesting. I actually, Theo actually co-authored [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1431.16s)]
*  a scholarly book chapter where we looked at all the demographics. I mean, you name it, you know, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1437.0s)]
*  gender, location, what led to the near death experience, and we could find no correlation [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1443.4s)]
*  with what the life-threatening event was, what your demographic background was, didn't really [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1449.48s)]
*  seem to predict the probability of having a near death experience when you nearly die, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1455.8s)]
*  nor what the content would be. So you're saying, yeah, because I would think some ethnicities, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1460.76s)]
*  and you know, and probably like, I'm not going to, you know, but people in like Memphis or [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1465.16s)]
*  something might be more likely to have near death experiences because there's more near death going [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1469.96s)]
*  on, you know what I'm saying? Like, but you didn't find that any ethnicities or genders or anything [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1474.36s)]
*  or ages had, none were more likely to have near death experiences than others. Yeah, absolutely [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1481.6399999999999s)]
*  not. There was some earlier research, the thought maybe children were more likely to have a near [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1487.6399999999999s)]
*  death experience when they nearly died, but I'm not seeing that. So it seems to be, you know, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1492.1999999999998s)]
*  interestingly, Theo, I mean, children just came from life. They just came from life. So you think [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1497.24s)]
*  like, oh, they might have maybe just, they got a shorter tether. Well, yeah, and I think so, you [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1502.04s)]
*  know, they'd be less likely to, but on the other hand, Theo, I studied very young children, age five [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  and below. Average age of the study group was three and a half years old. Now at that very young age, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1512.84s)]
*  when they had their near death experience, they're practically a cultural blank slate. They almost [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1519.8s)]
*  certainly have no formed ideas about religion, the afterlife. They almost certainly have never heard [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1525.24s)]
*  of what near death experience is or wouldn't understand it if they had. And yet these people [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1530.68s)]
*  statistically had basically exactly the same content, the elements of near death experience [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1535.8s)]
*  as older children and adult, which is a very strong line of evidence that pre-existing beliefs [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1541.3200000000002s)]
*  don't really lead to people, you know, having a near death experience or what the content of the [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1547.4s)]
*  near death experience is. Wow, that's fascinating. So whether it was a 90 year old or a seven year [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1552.52s)]
*  old that seemed to articulate well, you found that what they shared had a lot of similarities. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1558.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And that's exciting because, you know, it seems- [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1564.1200000000001s)]
*  It gives you some proof that you're onto something that, you know, it just furthers your belief. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1568.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, it really eliminates the skeptic concern that the near death experiences are pre-existing [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1572.68s)]
*  beliefs. It's what they thought would happen. And there's absolutely- [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1579.16s)]
*  Right, because a child doesn't really have enough time to have too much of a pre-existing belief. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1582.76s)]
*  Exactly. You wouldn't think. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1585.72s)]
*  Exactly. Man, I've been so dehydrated from flying around, from sweating, from letting [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1587.24s)]
*  fluid out of my body. You will be dehydrated, baby. And Liquid IV helps. Gosh, it'll turn water just [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1595.4s)]
*  into just a beautiful nectar that just fills you up. It really will. With three times the electrolytes [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1605.08s)]

*  are remarkable. They got one of them. It's called white lime or something. Or what is it? Dang, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1623.4s)]

*  The new year for many people means finding out ways to save some money. You know what I'm talking [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1657.64s)]
*  about? Some women will start cutting their husband's hair a lot around this time of year [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1664.2s)]
*  and they saving money, but the husband has to look kind of bad or whatever. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1671.48s)]
*  But after the holidays, we could all use a little cash in our pockets. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1676.28s)]
*  That's why Ibotta is here to help. Ibotta is a free app that gives you the most cash back every time [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1680.68s)]

*  Theo. That's Ibotta in the Google Play or app store and use code Theo. One thing that I found [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1726.84s)]
*  that was really interesting that really made me lock in and want to learn more was when you said [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1734.36s)]
*  people of different religious beliefs and things like that, none of them, they all had the same [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1738.44s)]
*  characteristics of their experience if they had a near-death experience. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1747.56s)]
*  You're exactly right, Theo. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1751.16s)]
*  That really shocked me. I was like, wow. So anyway, that's one of the things that really hooked me in. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1752.52s)]
*  Yeah, and that's exactly right. In my research, we've had, well, the website, our research website [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1757.3999999999999s)]
*  has been translated into over 30 different languages. So as a result, we can do by far [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1763.56s)]
*  the largest cross-cultural study in the world. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1769.24s)]
*  Otherwise, if you get some guy fresh out the barrio or something and he's like, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1771.48s)]
*  we was dreaming. You know, hold on, bro. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1777.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what's exciting when you have pull in near-death experiences literally from [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1780.44s)]
*  all around the world in their native language. So we have about 60 what we call non-Western [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1785.48s)]
*  near-death experiences. These are in countries where they're not predominantly Judeo-Christian [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1790.52s)]
*  and they're from just, you name the religious background, I've run into it. And remarkably, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1795.48s)]
*  these non-Western near-death experiences, the content, what occurs, the elements are strikingly [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1800.52s)]
*  similar to typical Western near-death experiences. And in fact, I've co-authored a scholarly paper [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1807.6399999999999s)]
*  with an Iranian near-death experience researcher, looked at a couple dozen people that had near-death [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1813.08s)]
*  experiences in Iran. Exactly what I'm seeing in my series, no matter where on earth you have your [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1818.2s)]
*  near-death experience, amazingly, it doesn't make any difference, Theo, whether you're say a Muslim [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1824.3600000000001s)]
*  in Egypt or Hindu in India or a Christian in the United States or no religious belief at all, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1829.64s)]
*  wherever on the planet you have your near-death experience, whatever age, the content, what [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1834.92s)]
*  occurs is going to be strikingly similar. Do you feel like over time though that you became, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1839.88s)]
*  what am I, the term I'm looking for, like you became, that's what you started looking for, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1844.28s)]
*  you know what I'm talking about? Oh, I, I, what's the term I'm looking for, you know what I'm talking [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1849.56s)]
*  about? Yeah, confirmation bias. Yeah, yeah, did you believe, did you worry about that? Did you take [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1853.56s)]
*  that into account at all? Oh, absolutely. As a researcher, I have to carefully minimize anything [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1859.32s)]
*  that would affect wrongly my interpretation. And confirmation bias is one thing, but that's the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1865.8799999999999s)]
*  glory of having the survey and then archiving the results and then posting them all. Theo, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1872.44s)]
*  we have over 4,000 near-death experiences posted. We have scores of non-Western near-death experiences. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1878.28s)]
*  Give me one of those that was interesting that kind of really surprised you. Was there, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1885.72s)]
*  is there one that stands out like a non-Western? Yeah, we have, there was a lady who was literally [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1888.76s)]
*  dying of Hodgkin lymphoma. Oh, gosh. And, you know, tragically was given basically no chance [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1894.6s)]
*  of survival. And right at death's door, she had a near-death experience, a profoundly detailed [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1901.9599999999998s)]
*  near-death experience. And as part of that, she became aware that if she was to choose to return [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1908.4399999999998s)]
*  to earthly life, that the lab results that were just drawn would come back showing she was [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1914.1999999999998s)]
*  recovering. She was starting to respond. And if she chose not to return to her earthly life, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1919.4s)]
*  that the lab results would indicate she was on her path to irreversible permanent death. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1925.3200000000002s)]
*  Amazingly, she recovered. And when she recovered, she had an amazing, highly detailed [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1930.44s)]
*  near-death experience with most of the characteristics we've talked about now. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1936.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, see, that's interesting because that makes me think that some of the information that you get [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1940.1200000000001s)]
*  are in a near-death experience, right? And I hate that we keep having to say the term over and over [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1944.84s)]
*  again, but we have to say it. Yeah, we do. Yeah, we really do. Some of the information that you get [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1949.72s)]
*  during an experience like that, I wonder if some of it then, because at first I'm thinking it comes [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1954.6799999999998s)]
*  from the other side, it comes from the great beyond, you know, that, but then now I'm thinking [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1959.72s)]
*  that if you're getting information where you see that you may be getting lab results coming, that [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1965.8799999999999s)]
*  would be different if you return. That makes you wonder if some of that information is somehow [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1970.28s)]
*  coming out of your body, like on this side and service and, you know, does that make any sense? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1974.6s)]
*  Well, normally you would- Does it make sense or not? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1981.48s)]
*  Yeah, it does because you would have to say maybe you have a personal deep down sense [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1983.24s)]
*  that this is going to happen. However- Right, if that's the case, then I would be thinking [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1987.8799999999999s)]
*  that some of that near-death experience is influenced on this side of life as opposed to [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1990.84s)]
*  what part of me was leaning towards it being influenced on the other side of life. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1995.96s)]
*  Absolutely, so, you know, it's very reasonable to hypothesize that maybe something that occurs [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=1999.96s)]
*  or is described in near-death experiences is just because they had that sense, that inner awareness [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2006.6000000000001s)]
*  in their physical body, but Theo, their unconscious are clinically dead when they have their near-death [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2011.96s)]
*  experiences, so they really can't gather from that sense, that memory, that subconscious part [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2018.1200000000001s)]
*  of themselves, because everything is shut down when they have a near-death experience. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2023.96s)]
*  Are there other choices? I know you mentioned early on that people were, there were choices [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2028.92s)]
*  that people had to make, so that one is a lady saying lab results could make her, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2033.4s)]
*  upcoming lab results could be different. Were there other choices that came up? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you the most poignant choice that we encountered in near-death experiences, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2042.92s)]
*  and that is a choice to stay in that unearthly beautiful realm, in the environment they're in, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2047.8000000000002s)]
*  off of their spirits, or the choice to return to their earthly life and struggle to overcome [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2053.4s)]
*  that life-threatening event that they caused the near-death experience. Oh, I see. And this is where [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2059.4s)]
*  it gets really interesting, Theo, at that moment of decision, even though people having the near-death [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2066.04s)]
*  experience, everything that they knew up to that time, friends, family, loved ones, decades of their [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2072.12s)]
*  life often, is their earthly life. And yet, what they're experiencing in this unearthly realm, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2079.56s)]
*  overwhelming sense of peace and love, those are about the two most common words used, and they [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2085.96s)]
*  often describe that they feel this unearthly beautiful realm is their real home, their true [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2092.12s)]
*  home. But the great majority of people that are in that unearthly heavenly realm that make a decision, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2098.12s)]
*  or ask to make a decision, want to stay there. They want to leave their earthly life and not [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2103.96s)]
*  come back. And believe me, that is a difficult decision. They will often argue with the beings [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2109.56s)]
*  there. Oh, yeah, it's like when you go to Destin for the first time. You've been in Destin? Oh, yeah, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2115.8s)]
*  so that's really interesting. I never want to live there. That's just how compelling and beautiful [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2119.2400000000002s)]
*  and what the sense is like in this unearthly beautiful realm that they're in of near-death [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2124.44s)]
*  experience. Wow, see, and so that makes me believe that it's not like ayahuasca because [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2129.32s)]
*  in ayahuasca, and I only compare to that because I've done some of the other psychotropics, LSD, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2134.28s)]
*  and mushrooms, right? And those are the only ones I've done. I know there's a lot of new ones and [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2141.8s)]
*  people are sucking on animals or whatever and licking frogs or whatever. There's some stuff. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  I hope not a lot, Theo. I mean, I don't know. Look, I know a dude who's done a thing or two down there, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2151.96s)]
*  a couple of months. Well, I'll leave a taste in my mouth, but moving on. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2157.88s)]
*  Look, I know a guy north of Panama City. I don't know if he's ever gotten high, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2162.84s)]
*  but he's definitely done some things. Oh, okay. Goodness, great. But on ayahuasca, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2166.12s)]
*  I never felt a sense of peace. It's always a sense of learning and constant, like, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2171.24s)]
*  not negotiating, but revealing and catharsis, but not a big, some relief, but never. It feels very [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2178.84s)]
*  much like you're in a long period of therapy, which sometimes can be extremely intense. So it [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2187.4s)]
*  doesn't feel like you're in this, you know, a million thread count, you know, space, which [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2192.76s)]
*  that sounds like what you're talking about. Wow. Now, is there a, and if so people, if they, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2200.84s)]
*  some people might have near-death experience, but they just die and you're like, oh shit, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2209.08s)]
*  we didn't get the information. Oh, absolutely. I mean, you know, at a life-threatening event, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2212.44s)]
*  you know, certainly, unfortunately, a lot of people will ultimately permanently and irreversibly die. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2218.68s)]
*  So that's, you know, that's it. However, that brings up an interesting point. We do have a [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2224.12s)]
*  small series of what we call shared near-death experience. These are two or more people that [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2230.36s)]
*  simultaneously had a life-threatening event. No. And true story. We've got, we're up to about [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2235.8s)]
*  20 posted on the website, so it's not, not a real small. So what happens? I mean, you name it, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2242.6800000000003s)]
*  auto accidents, collapsing building, you know, some kind of accident out in nature. These are all [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2247.48s)]
*  common precipitating events. So two or more people, boom, they're in that life-threatening [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2254.36s)]
*  event in a shared near-death experience. They can interact with each other. They be aware of their [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2259.32s)]
*  physical body down below in these shared near-death experiences, at least in the series I have. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2265.0s)]
*  One goes on to permanently irreversibly die. The other returns back to their body. And then [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2271.32s)]
*  when they recover, they can talk about a shared near-death experience. Now, Theo, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2276.76s)]
*  that is some of the strongest evidence I can conceive of that for those permanently, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2281.1600000000003s)]
*  irreversibly dying, what you observe in a near-death experience is that initial pathway. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2285.56s)]
*  But you're saying one of them died and one of them didn't. But if one, if one of them died, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2290.6800000000003s)]
*  then how do you know that that person had the experience too? Because the other person shared [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2294.44s)]
*  an experience with them. They talked, they interacted, they communicated. Oh, so the one [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2298.76s)]
*  that lived said that they both had an out-of-body experience. Both of them were together. For example, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2302.92s)]
*  we had, from Canada, we had a caught bad car accident and a gentleman was driving with his [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2309.0800000000004s)]
*  fiance. Boom, car, he fell asleep and hit a tree. Both him and his fiance had that out-of-body [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2315.0800000000004s)]
*  experience, holding hands. I mean, they were fiancees. Oh, yes, sweet. Rose up and then they were able to [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2322.1200000000003s)]
*  see this unearthly, beautiful realm in the distance. There were four beings that came up to them. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2327.72s)]
*  Two of them went to her, two of them went to him and they separated their holding hands. They felt [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2334.4399999999996s)]
*  so much peace and love, they described. He wanted to say no, but felt so compelling, compellingly. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2340.7599999999998s)]
*  That's why it was remarkable that he felt so much peace and love that he didn't want to resist it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2347.3999999999996s)]
*  And so he watched the two beings carry his fiance toward this beautiful, unearthly realm in the [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2351.8799999999997s)]
*  distance. The other two beings gently lowered him back down to the car from way above the car. He saw [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2357.4s)]
*  the front end on fire and then he went back into his body and he felt that when he returned to [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2363.8s)]
*  consciousness, his fiance leaning on his shoulder as she was when he had the accident and he knew [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2369.64s)]
*  immediately fiance was dead. She was an empty shell and that he had left her with those beings [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2376.92s)]
*  above. That's a shared near-death experience and very dramatic. Shared near-death experiences are [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2383.0s)]
*  so unbelievable. I mean out of 4,000 you know what I have, maybe about 20. That's how rare they are [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2389.56s)]
*  and yet they're so dramatic in terms of providing evidence that for those that permanently, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2394.76s)]
*  irreversibly die, their consciousness continues to live and will eventually be reunited. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2399.96s)]
*  See that's so why the fact that two people had it. Now was there ever two people that had it and both [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2406.52s)]
*  of them lived? There have been, not in my series, there has been a report of [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2411.96s)]
*  firefighters. They were called the hot shots in Arizona and they were battling a fire and the fire [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2419.4s)]
*  changed direction. They performed Vegas too. Yeah and then they wind changed direction and trapped them and so [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2425.56s)]
*  there were many of the firefighters that died and certainly all of them had a life-threatening event [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2431.4s)]
*  and they were aware of each other and then ultimately came back to report that remarkable [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2437.0s)]
*  shared near-death experiences where several lived and several died. Wow. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2441.88s)]
*  Oh man. That's, I was that for food for thought. Those just blow me away. I mean I tell you, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2448.44s)]
*  even after 4,000 near-death experiences when I read these shared near-death experiences [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2454.44s)]
*  I'm still in awe even after 25 years. Can you tell when some people, some are fake? We are very [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2459.96s)]
*  careful to investigate whether they're fake. Theo, we ask many of our survey questions in a similar [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2466.36s)]
*  concept we're asking but worded differently in different sections of the survey. So as a result [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2473.0s)]
*  we use that tried and true method to make sure that the near-death experience responses are valid. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2478.52s)]
*  Above and beyond that as a doctor I can certainly spot things that don't add up medically but finally [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2484.84s)]
*  if the overwhelming majority of people share true and honest near-death experiences even those people [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2491.08s)]
*  that share falsified near-death experiences if they're that rare it isn't really going to change [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2497.24s)]
*  our overall understanding of what happens during a near-death experience and what their meaning is. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2502.36s)]
*  What are some things that people do where that if they're telling a fake near-death experience [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2508.36s)]
*  where you can kind of spot those right because there's got to be commonalities there too I'm sure. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2512.2s)]
*  The main well first of all when we do our survey we always post it anonymously. They don't get [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2516.2s)]
*  paid anything they literally have no public recognition because there's no real uh no [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2521.64s)]
*  incentive no incentive at all right for them no cloud at all no direction for them to share a [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2527.56s)]
*  falsified account. Yeah no coughing cloud or whatever they call it. It would take probably [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2533.08s)]
*  most people especially with a detailed account over an hour to fill that out and so people [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2537.0s)]
*  generally aren't going to do that just for laughs. So I think in general and certainly what we're [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2542.6s)]
*  observing in our near-death experience accounts are strikingly similar to what all other researchers [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2548.8399999999997s)]
*  are finding in their research series. So I'm reasonably confident that these great great [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2555.16s)]
*  majority of you know not virtually all are legitimate are legitimate. Yeah what are what are [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2560.92s)]
*  is it mostly when is it more women that fill them out than the men because women I think low key [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2565.48s)]
*  want to die all the time I feel like. Well because they love date line you know I'm saying [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2569.88s)]
*  they're always like oh you know they're always leaving a window open. That's a great question [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2575.4s)]
*  it's probably pretty close to 50-50 but I'll tell you why I think Theo guys like us are just a little [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2579.56s)]
*  more inclined than women to drive the car fast to go do risky things you know swim in places we [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2586.6s)]
*  shouldn't swim we've all been I mean it's a guy thing so we may be a little more predisposed to [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2593.4s)]
*  have fun in some risky way women I think are a little less inclined to do that so I think that [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2598.6s)]
*  may help explain why it's about 50-50. Right because you have more men that are actually getting [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2603.64s)]
*  doing getting close with death and accidents right but you have more women who may share stories like [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2608.68s)]
*  that. Yeah they're more inclined to share women childbirth and you know severe complications and [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2615.56s)]
*  clinical death during childbirth we have a huge number of those type of near-death experiences. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2620.92s)]
*  Have you ever had a woman that had a child and then the child I guess the child wouldn't be able [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2625.4s)]
*  to recollect something like that. Yeah no we don't have any if a lady had a near-death experience [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2630.12s)]
*  there's no you know obviously they're they are very good at delivering the baby even if she has [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2636.2000000000003s)]
*  a life-threatening event but there's no real discussion later from that child of oh I had a [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2642.6s)]
*  shared near-death experience. Right like years later that it would recollect. Yeah that would be [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2648.36s)]
*  too hard to remember. What motivates you to care about this? I am fascinated by near-death experiences [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2652.6s)]
*  even after 25 years and 4,000 near-death experiences. You ever been to bush gardens? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2660.68s)]
*  Yeah I have oh yeah that's awesome too. That's that's true but I love all that kind of stuff. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2665.16s)]
*  It's fun well near-death experiences to me it continues to remind me that there's an afterlife [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2669.72s)]
*  a wonderful afterlife and that's for all of us. I'm a physician that treats patients with cancer [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2676.2799999999997s)]
*  these are my patients that have life-threatening events and I'm involved with them every day. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2682.28s)]
*  What I know about near-death experience has helped me to help them in their journey with their battle [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2687.4s)]
*  with cancer in a way with more courage more confidence that even if we ultimately don't [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2693.0800000000004s)]
*  cure them that in the end they're going to have a wonderful afterlife and as I've told them you're [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2699.32s)]
*  going to be in a much better place than those left on our earthly life. So I think that's really you [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2705.32s)]
*  know certainly something to look forward to. I hope and I believe that too because even just living [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2711.64s)]
*  is so like that's what I always say when people are like I don't believe in an afterlife. I'm like [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2717.48s)]
*  all right you know like first of all what like okay you know because here's why my biggest proof [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2725.48s)]
*  is that we lived at all. Yeah. That's my like at least believe in reincarnation because we already [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2735.4s)]
*  lived. Yeah. How do you then why you then don't even believe you're here then if you're not even [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2741.32s)]
*  going to believe it's possible against it that's ridiculous like I'm doing this right now you're [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2745.8s)]
*  going to tell me and I came out of nothing I don't know where I was. Yeah. You know I got some vague [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2749.88s)]
*  ideas and you know I'll sketch some stuff every now and then but I don't have any real information [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2755.56s)]
*  but to think this couldn't happen again to me seems asinine it's because you you have proof like [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2760.1200000000003s)]
*  you're living in proof. That could be different if you weren't but you're freaking living in proof [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2766.68s)]
*  that you that existence from nothing is possible now I know you came from people when you came from [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2772.44s)]
*  sex but they eventually we don't know where they came from you know. Yeah. We don't know where life [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2777.8799999999997s)]
*  came from that's the thing. Sure no and absolutely that's already yell at you or anything. No this is [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2783.64s)]
*  great hey Thiel this is what I find among other things very inspiring about near-death experiences. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2788.52s)]
*  I mean here over and over is very powerful evidence that we do have a life after death [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2794.68s)]
*  our consciousness goes on we're not really going both for us our friends our family our loved ones [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2800.8399999999997s)]
*  when we have that final end of our earthly physical life there's a much bigger picture [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2808.2s)]
*  a much weak continuation of consciousness eternal and infinite as best I can tell from near-death [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2813.08s)]
*  experiences and that's exciting yeah I mean whenever earthly life gets miserable difficult [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2818.84s)]
*  that we've all been there all of us and you always have that that thought in the back of your mind [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2825.4s)]
*  from near-death experiences wow here is the evidence powerful evidence that we go on. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2831.1600000000003s)]
*  Well it makes me think like you know we used to bring it back up that Aeroid site was that [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2836.6000000000004s)]
*  yeah EROWID.org. EROWID so yeah if you'll zoom in on here the vaults of Aeroid and this was the site [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2844.12s)]
*  you were talking where people share their experiences from different psychedelic techniques [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2851.48s)]
*  and methods. Psychotropic drugs. Psychotropic drugs and it also says on here there's breathing [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2857.56s)]
*  dreaming drumming fasting so it seems like there's a lot of different like modalities people used [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2864.12s)]
*  to get to different now maybe all these are on while they're under the influence of psychedelic [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2870.44s)]
*  drugs no I you know these are are obviously different ways in which an altered consciousness [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2875.1600000000003s)]
*  can be achieved right okay and that's what's so cool about this site I mean here are the original [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2880.36s)]
*  first person accounts yes a lot like my own nderf.org website where there's really no [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2885.32s)]
*  they're posted typically anonymously there's no real incentive for them to make any of this up [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2892.2000000000003s)]
*  these are people that just want to share with the world what happened during their experiences [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2897.0s)]
*  often they're going to select out their most dramatic interesting experiences but it is a [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2901.8s)]
*  treasure trove of altered states of consciousness yeah I love this and so some of these on here are [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2906.76s)]
*  somewhere it seems like it's not just uh drug induced not just so psychotropic that means drugs [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2913.16s)]
*  right yes okay so some of these it has breathing dancing um dreaming drumming uh fasting [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2919.56s)]
*  meditation prayer martial arts yoga um just has different modalities some I've used half of those [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2927.88s)]
*  breathing I worked with a comedian this girl Blair Sochi and she does breath work and I had an [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2936.04s)]
*  experience there that was um very uh it wasn't like a near-death experience but it was beyond [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2942.28s)]
*  something I'd ever had before where my it locked up all of my muscles and I was just with my um [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2951.24s)]
*  some like way my conscience was you know and that and it took a I remember just ball just tears [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2960.2799999999997s)]
*  coming out of me like it was like uh a cleansing of some sort um martial arts I've done MMA where [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2967.48s)]
*  at the end of the class you just sat there and just like start crying because you've done so much [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2974.8399999999997s)]
*  like just different ways your muscles and releasing things and stuff and it um and I think a long time [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2979.88s)]
*  ago they used to do a lot of sweating a lot of meditation you know um historically that's kind [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2987.1600000000003s)]
*  of what I was getting at was like I wonder if there was more connection with the afterlife in previous [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2992.44s)]
*  centuries and ages of time because they used uh less technological modalities and more [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=2999.7200000000003s)]
*  like uh actual physical practicing of things you know even if you go look at like the Egyptians [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3009.4s)]
*  they would draw and bury their dead sometimes with tombs sometimes with tunnels that they said would [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3015.16s)]
*  lead to another little tomb that just had gifts of the afterlife and like they had just it feels [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3021.72s)]
*  like they had a much more spiritual connection maybe with with here and something beyond because [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3027.64s)]
*  they I mean to build a you know to build a tomb and to bury somebody with all your worldly goods [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3034.12s)]
*  that you have to take all your money and bury it with a friend so that they can use it in the next [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3041.0s)]
*  realm it's you know just a lot of that's really fascinating because we don't practice a lot of [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3046.52s)]
*  that anymore now somebody will slip you a perk or slip you a thing of cigarettes or something on the [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3050.7599999999998s)]
*  way you know okay you know I'm so glad you brought that up Theo does it make any sense what I'm saying [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3055.0s)]
*  absolutely and in fact I'll take that and run with it near-death experiences as dramatic as [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3059.24s)]
*  they are and as much as they point to that afterlife they're really a subset of that bigger [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3064.7599999999998s)]
*  picture just like what you were talking about the umbrella is spiritual experiences in general [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3069.72s)]
*  you know absolutely you can have that type of spiritual experience with martial arts I [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3075.3999999999996s)]
*  was a brown belt in karate I get that I've walked a mile in those I can't say shoes because we're [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3080.3599999999997s)]
*  barefoot yeah so but on top of that you can have certainly meditation experiences can produce some [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3085.0s)]
*  dramatic experiences the scholarly literature describes these as mystical experiences and [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3091.4s)]
*  there's a whole wealth of literature out there about people that can have very dramatic experiences [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3097.72s)]
*  sometimes they even reproduce many of the characteristics of near-death experiences [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3104.28s)]
*  and yet they're all part of that if you will the umbrella that bigger picture [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3109.08s)]
*  all converging with evidence on the fact that there's consciousness far beyond what we're aware [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3113.48s)]
*  of in our earthly life that there's an afterlife there our consciousness is much more than just [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3119.48s)]
*  what we think with how we interact with other people our conscious earthly everyday experience [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3125.56s)]
*  that's just a subset of a much bigger picture of consciousness just like what you were saying [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3131.48s)]
*  yeah all of those things seem to touch yeah they seem to find ways um I don't know I just feel like [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3136.84s)]
*  historically we probably even though now we're able to catalog things better I mean back then [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3143.8s)]
*  you had to draw it on a cave wall or you had to whisper to your buddy you know and if he gets [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3147.7200000000003s)]
*  damn you know yeah you know he comes across a rare STD on a mountaintop and it's you know nobody [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3152.28s)]
*  knows what what happened and it's so it's like you know just different times or you know it just now [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3157.2400000000002s)]
*  we can catalog more I feel like but the connect the experience we have uh is kind of we have less [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3163.08s)]
*  experiences maybe I don't know I just it seems like our forefathers they this was like a saturday [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3171.64s)]
*  night they'd get together in a sweat lodge and they wanted to see something you know but it was [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3179.64s)]
*  you had to you know make your own uh netflix in your in your brain yeah you know I think you're [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3183.88s)]
*  right I think you're really onto something there here's my take on that I think years ago centuries [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3188.92s)]
*  ago I think there was probably more openness to these types of experiences I think there was more [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3195.32s)]
*  you know when we didn't have that sort of scientific rigidity about what the brain can do and what it [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3201.56s)]
*  can't do I think people collectively were more inclined to share these stories to have people [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3206.36s)]
*  believe them to value them and as a result of that allow them to be shared you know verbal tradition [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3212.36s)]
*  probably much more so than we have today because people were probably less afraid to share that [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3218.68s)]
*  these were more tight-knit communities I mean they knew each other they interacted with each other [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3224.52s)]
*  and so I think there was more trust that we have today today we're sort of apart from each other [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3229.48s)]
*  more I think it's harder to develop that interpersonal trust perhaps as much as existed [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3234.68s)]
*  centuries ago that's a shame among many other reasons people today may be less inclined to [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3239.3999999999996s)]
*  share with others their spiritual experiences because they're afraid they'll be judged yeah [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3245.88s)]
*  I want to let you know that the best way to learn a language is immersion that's right [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3251.4s)]
*  living where the language is spoken and using it every day [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3259.88s)]
*  but if that's not in the cards this year you can still learn a language the second best way [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3265.1600000000003s)]
*  and that's with babble that's what I like to use don't pay hundreds of dollars for private tutors [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3270.8399999999997s)]
*  or waste hours on apps that don't really help you speak the language babbles quick 10-minute [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3277.48s)]
*  lessons are designed by over 150 language experts to help you start speaking a new language in as [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3283.7999999999997s)]

*  and that's really really exciting yeah or there's not as there's well it's interesting because [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3323.7200000000003s)]
*  there's it used to be I mean sometimes you would be the chief of a village if you had had like a [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3329.08s)]
*  if you had gotten to you know connect with the third eye you know it like there was a lot of [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3334.04s)]
*  enhancement and and um yeah there seemed to be a lot of more of a social value to it [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3340.2799999999997s)]
*  and I think we're still going through this metamorphosis maybe where you know we tried a [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3348.12s)]
*  lot of uh medicines to cure people like a lot of western medicine that is proven to be or slowly [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3352.7599999999998s)]
*  more and more proving to be very much um not as helpful as we thought more causing more addiction [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3359.3199999999997s)]
*  than it is like probably benefits overall maybe um and I'm saying that to a doctor maybe I shouldn't [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3366.44s)]
*  be but but that we're getting more to where people are I feel like we're trying to get back to nature [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3373.16s)]
*  and to finding ways to a take care of ourselves better um and then b uh use other modalities to [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3380.44s)]
*  particularly things that we struggle with thinking and feeling wise than medicine does that make any [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3391.2400000000002s)]
*  sense or not oh I think I see where you're going with that the now more than ever we're focused on [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3397.32s)]
*  we start with a focus on the patient what's best for the patient well prevention you know certainly [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3403.4s)]
*  um treatments that have less toxicity very strong focus in my specialty radiation oncology where we [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3409.0800000000004s)]
*  treat cancer we're more interested in the totality of the patient how are these treatments [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3415.88s)]
*  affecting them how can we mitigate these adverse effects how can we sort of consider the patient [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3421.4s)]
*  totally mentally physically spiritually and help be everything that we can as health care providers [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3427.2400000000002s)]
*  in a way that we perhaps hadn't even thought about before so there's a real it's kind of [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3434.12s)]
*  interesting we're really kind of at a threshold now where there's with a focus like that I think [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3438.76s)]
*  we're I know we're we're curing more people especially with cancer my specialty than we [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3444.04s)]
*  ever did before but I think importantly we're helping people to live better than ever before [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3448.7599999999998s)]
*  because we're so focused on the total patient have there been experiences where you've been [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3454.36s)]
*  able to discuss with cancer patients who uh weren't fortunate enough to to to get into remission that [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3459.24s)]
*  you felt like talking about the afterlife and possibilities and people's experiences have been [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3466.36s)]
*  helpful to them oh absolutely uh of course I'm a well-known near-death experience researcher so [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3472.12s)]
*  over and over we have patients or their family members google who is this dr long guy and oh [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3479.4s)]
*  my gosh you know I hear my hundreds of times I've talked to the media and been around and for people [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3485.08s)]
*  that are aware of that they will generally come talk with me about that next time they see me [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3490.8399999999997s)]
*  that can be profoundly inspirational to somebody who's got a life-threatening illness they're in [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3495.56s)]
*  fear about that their family their loved ones they know they might not make it and yet here's [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3501.08s)]
*  the research the information I have powerful evidence that there is life after death that [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3507.24s)]
*  there's a bigger picture for who we are what we are that we're not just physical brain function [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3513.4s)]
*  that we are a consciousness that's going to survive our earthly death it is incredibly [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3519.24s)]
*  important to patients that come to that understanding I've spent huge amounts of time [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3524.7599999999998s)]
*  talking about that with patients and I love that I consider that to be a very special and important [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3529.72s)]
*  part of how I practice medicine going in that extra dimension like yeah well it's it's just it's it's [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3535.7999999999997s)]
*  you know for one it's a blessing that you care about this because you're also in it in a in a [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3542.3599999999997s)]
*  field where people are are walking or are having to deal with that you know sooner maybe than they [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3550.04s)]
*  expected do you ever have you ever been there when somebody was passing away and just kind of like [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3557.88s)]
*  been like hey come on back you know well yeah I mean I've done CPR for real a few times and [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3564.6s)]
*  you know that yeah I'll tell you what that is like look around while you're down there [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3571.1600000000003s)]
*  the first thing they say in the books is when you have someone codes their heart stops and you have [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3576.2000000000003s)]
*  to try to bring them back from the brink check your own pulse first too because you're ah that's [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3580.28s)]
*  pretty pretty eerie but because you can freak out oh it's spooky I mean your your heart rate I [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3585.72s)]
*  mean it's frantic when you have to do CPR well when I do it for real yeah oh yeah when we brought [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3591.48s)]
*  people I mean this is literally unexpected typically it's life and death um you know it's there we're [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3595.7999999999997s)]
*  we're frantically trying to do the best we can I'd be worried like if say if there's house music [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3603.0s)]
*  playing in the place I would be worried I would just what if you just tap into it you're like [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3607.3199999999997s)]
*  what is going on oh come on you know no you [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3611.3199999999997s)]
*  Theo I just don't want to be laying a james blake track on somebody you know like at least I mean I [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3614.9199999999996s)]
*  can't speak for others but I'll tell you when I've done you know what you're doing yeah you stay [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3619.4799999999996s)]
*  focused and you want to make sure you're doing just the right number of chest compressions [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3623.72s)]
*  per minute and breathing and breathing and it's just you know get out the way for cotton eye joe [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3628.04s)]
*  and just playing that you know what I'm saying I don't want to talk about again you'd make an [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3633.0s)]
*  awesome doctor I love that Theo we need to get because that would be I haven't heard a doctor [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3636.44s)]
*  ever share that but hey you know that's I think I would be disbarred immediately I'm just saying [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3640.6s)]
*  that like if you're not really locked in on what you're doing if you're doing CPR on somebody you [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3644.92s)]
*  know yeah and somebody just you know lays it lays some kind of a track in the distance anything can [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3649.16s)]
*  happen you know yeah um have you ever had a near-death experience no I haven't thank goodness so [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3654.04s)]
*  now have you is there a part of you that because at some point you gotta you know put your muffins [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3658.44s)]
*  where the oven is you know what I'm saying bro like that and like that you know what I'm saying [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3665.88s)]
*  at some point okay there people were gonna you know what I'm saying if you want to write the [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3670.36s)]
*  third book you gotta have to go over there but let me tell you how it works in the real world [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3675.2400000000002s)]
*  here Theo people that have had a near-death experience in general typically are not near-death [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3679.08s)]
*  experience researchers and I think the reason for that is they know about near-death experience it [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3685.0s)]
*  is grippingly real they understand it they understand its implications in their life [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3690.2s)]
*  and so as a result of that they're not asking questions like me and so many other people that [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3695.48s)]
*  do research in this area that want to know is it real what happens so again but in your death [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3700.6s)]
*  experience cures any near-death experience disbelief that's for sure does part of you ever wish like [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3706.6s)]
*  you know and it's not nobody wants to because near-death experience you got a death is in the [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3712.2799999999997s)]
*  middle of it that's the tricky part of the rest of you can handle but death is the part you got [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3717.96s)]
*  to risk you know but is any part of you ever like you know we're like oh where if you say you've [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3722.84s)]
*  ever been skiing and then you fall you're like oh this could be it let's see what happens here [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3728.84s)]
*  yeah I'll tell you I have so many irons in the fire in my life I've got a full-time medical practice [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3732.6s)]
*  I love doing research and sharing about near-death experience I've got so much going on I'm very [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3738.92s)]
*  careful not to get into a life-threatening event I mean you know I mean I get what you're coming [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3744.36s)]
*  from sure at one level it would be I think an adjunct to my research to say this is what I [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3749.2400000000002s)]
*  experienced and here's what happened but don't you think that might be now you get a little [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3755.0s)]
*  confirmation bias I agree and I'd start to see other near-death experiences through the filter [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3759.8s)]
*  of my own yeah dude I can't believe earlier I was like we have a don't you think there's a lot of [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3765.2400000000002s)]
*  confirmation bias and then I just try to talk you in a confirmation well I'd yeah again when I [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3769.24s)]
*  start my near-death experience research my scientist coat goes on I have to be very [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3775.24s)]
*  careful to use the best scientific methods and avoid those kind of pitfalls that are common in [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3780.68s)]
*  science yeah you know that you're still science so you're still applying science right absolutely [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3786.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that's one thing that makes it more valid you know um we had a guy Dr. Max Moron do you know [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3791.16s)]
*  this guy is I've heard the name I just can't can't place it he is a he does the um he runs the uh [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3798.12s)]
*  what's it called where they froze Walt Disney oh the cryogenics oh yeah he's a he's like a um [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3807.7999999999997s)]
*  he's like a philosopher he's like a futurist uh he's a director of uh he's the he was a ceo [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3813.64s)]
*  and a president of alcor life extension and that's where they do like cryonics and cryogenics where [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3821.24s)]
*  they freeze people right so I I we talked with him one time and I some people were like oh this [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3826.76s)]
*  whole thing's a scam right and and I looked at the financials of it it it wouldn't really be [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3833.8s)]
*  worth it I don't think if it were a scam it's just not that much money it doesn't seem like in it [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3839.32s)]
*  but it does seem like it's just kind of there's there's just sort of this blind hope that one day [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3844.28s)]
*  they will be able to like reincarnate or no to rehabilitate the like the physical us that's here [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3850.52s)]
*  right what are your thoughts on that like because it's not really the same world that you're in but [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3858.68s)]
*  there's there's this the afterlife is part of you don't hear much about the afterlife you know right [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3863.08s)]
*  well you know theo I'm as a researcher and a scientist and as a physician I'm interested in [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3868.6s)]
*  pretty much any aspects of possible survival of consciousness and here we have groups that are [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3874.04s)]
*  freezing bodies cryogenics hoping that people will be able to be resuscitated decades centuries [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3879.4s)]
*  from now and literally be brought back to life well a couple thoughts on that first of all I [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3887.32s)]
*  can't get over scientifically the fact that when you freeze cells human cells below 32 degrees [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3891.88s)]
*  the water in the cells expands boom it busts the cell membranes and the cells are literally dead [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3899.1600000000003s)]
*  how you can bring back completely busted trashed if you will cells in an entire living organism back [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3905.0s)]
*  to life is is absolutely outside of anything using in liquid nitrogen to do it right yeah well have [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3912.92s)]
*  that no that's cold so that would be and I think they do it at a quick enough level where they're [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3917.72s)]
*  saying that that doesn't happen that decomposition doesn't happen that's what their claimant is I [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3922.44s)]
*  the ability to suddenly freeze an entire physical organism I mean I'm not I'm not freezing or [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3927.96s)]
*  that would be and again I'm not an authority on that course yeah we're just kind of doesn't pass [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3933.32s)]
*  my sniff test but I think moreover the bigger picture here is people so afraid of leaving their [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3938.04s)]
*  earthly life so believing that earthly life is is all that they are and all that they can be I think [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3944.1200000000003s)]
*  if they knew what the overwhelming consistent message is in near-death experiences that our [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3950.36s)]
*  physical life isn't who we really are it isn't the end that what we are who we are is that eternal [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3955.88s)]
*  infinite consciousness that goes on living after our physical death here on earth yes tell me about [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3963.1600000000003s)]
*  some of that because so so yeah that's an area we haven't really gotten into what are people saying [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3968.76s)]
*  because these are people that they came back right so they didn't go you know they either didn't get [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3973.48s)]
*  accepted or whatever right now we're not judging them you know there's tons of applications right [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3978.36s)]
*  you know the afterlife gets countless applications every day these are interviewees who it feels like [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3982.6800000000003s)]
*  over there right okay and that's funny I mean there's actually been a study we uh that was [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3987.88s)]
*  someone went through literally over a thousand of our near-death experiences and when people are [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3993.7200000000003s)]
*  said over you guys as you mean yeah we are the ones we have right when I say we've studied over [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=3998.92s)]
*  four thousand near-death experiences those are posted on our ndr are all the ones you get posted [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4003.8s)]
*  or not all of them every single one that gives us permission which is way over 95 is posted but [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4009.64s)]
*  man you don't have any there's no like let's make sure that let's have there's no protocol for you [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4016.3599999999997s)]
*  guys to like be like come on this one didn't you know this one has Joaquin Phoenix in it you know [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4021.3199999999997s)]
*  like this one isn't it I have the integrity of the research I do requires that no matter what the [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4026.92s)]
*  content of the near-death experience if it appears to have occurred during a life-threatening event [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4033.4s)]
*  you know sometimes I'll you know unless it's blatantly falsified I mean hey Theo we got two [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4039.16s)]
*  near-death experiences in a row where they encountered Pamela Anderson and there's obviously [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4045.48s)]
*  some teenage probably boys they were having a good old time and boom boom okay I get that that's fake [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4051.48s)]
*  and that's rare thank goodness because again it just takes too long to do that but we have I have [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4057.96s)]
*  a whole write-up on how we very carefully validate these near-death experiences as real I understand [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4062.68s)]
*  we have a responsibility to the world to make sure that we have posted valid experiences because [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4069.7999999999997s)]
*  other researchers are using this interestingly artificial intelligence has gone through the [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4076.44s)]
*  internet and that's one of the major drivers of artificial intelligence understanding of near-death [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4081.0s)]
*  experience is the over 4 000 we have posted right so you guys have so many of them that obviously [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4086.44s)]
*  people are using it but yeah I was just trying to get if there's any barrier to entry between [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4091.32s)]
*  your site so there is some if there's some if people are saying Pamela Anderson or Samuel Jackson [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4095.1600000000003s)]
*  or whatever yeah you're like I don't know you know but yeah so the the integrity that of the research [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4100.360000000001s)]
*  we do is such that there's some if there's well there's a lot of integrity but there's some barrier [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4106.28s)]
*  to entry well not really if they if I mean this is less than one percent of people that have shared [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4110.84s)]
*  what we consider to be obviously falsified experience so it's it's I mean it's rare with [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4116.68s)]
*  that order of magnitude but you take some down that are obviously falsified well it's not we will [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4121.08s)]
*  it sometimes we learn we will post it and then subsequently as they and again these are usually [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4125.72s)]
*  people that have a commercial interest in their account and as time goes on we may come to [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4132.84s)]
*  understand that they falsified embellish their account using you guys as absolutely they're [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4137.64s)]
*  out of there if that happens so that again that's rare yeah and that says a lot about the [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4143.16s)]
*  integrity the of humans in general I mean people that have a near-death experience that is in [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4148.04s)]
*  general the most amazing influential experience of their life so let's talk about that sacred to them [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4155.0s)]
*  yeah okay so so that's interesting so people say it's sacred to them you know um what are some yeah [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4161.08s)]
*  what are some of the things if people go there they're on death's doorstep and they get to come [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4168.36s)]
*  back you know nobody was home they knocked they got some information maybe you know uh but what [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4172.28s)]
*  is some of the things that they what do we have you learned anything about the afterlife I guess [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4178.44s)]
*  or that that next step have you learned anything about that or do you feel like you've learned [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4183.719999999999s)]
*  anything absolutely I am extremely interested in that after years of doing research and being aware [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4187.5599999999995s)]
*  that they were remarkably consistently describing unearthly you know heavenly realms obviously as a [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4194.84s)]
*  researcher I'm dang interested in that so in our most recent version of the survey we've got a lot [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4201.88s)]
*  of questions where I try to drill down on that try to understand more about that remarkably [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4207.4800000000005s)]
*  consistent perspective on what lies beyond death's door and that's where Theo it gets dang interesting [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4213.08s)]
*  one thing we're okay talk interesting here so like dang what's it like okay you know it first of all [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4219.72s)]
*  you have to understand it's radically different from that physical earthly like that we know it's [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4225.8s)]
*  nothing like a separate geographically independent five senses dude yeah oh yeah you know how many [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4231.64s)]
*  senses you get probably when you're done here well you know there's yeah at least 12 senses I bet [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4237.08s)]
*  okay think about all the other senses you could have yet the more the merrier I know but [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4241.4800000000005s)]
*  regarding what I'm consistently seeing based on survey questions and spontaneous comments that [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4246.92s)]
*  they have the afterlife again completely non-physical uh motions non-physical communication [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4252.76s)]
*  they typically have a greatly accelerated consciousness they often have amazingly what [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4259.88s)]
*  they call universal knowledge it's a sense of knowing everything it's a bigger picture of [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4265.08s)]
*  knowledge far more than they could have known in their earthly life now see some of that really [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4270.28s)]
*  makes me sound a little bit like um you know I did a little bit of DMT with this guy from a smoothie [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4274.84s)]
*  shop right okay you know and that's uh it was in who I was in uh I think it was Maui basically yeah [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4280.92s)]
*  and I am I mean hell it might have been their damn um you know I think the guy's on their [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4287.64s)]
*  fan foot or whatever you look at the Maui them you know he's yeah anyway so uh but I remember [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4291.72s)]
*  thinking that all of my feelings were so limited the the the the yes my concept my concept of [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4298.68s)]
*  existence that I had here on earth was kindergarten compared to what else there was anyway when you [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4309.08s)]
*  said that that's that's just that's just all I you know I remember that go on and that's fascinating [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4318.2s)]
*  glad you shared that I think there's sort of different ways you can come to understand that [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4323.32s)]
*  what we know all the knowledge we have here on earth is incredibly small compared to that bigger [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4328.92s)]
*  picture that if you call universal knowledge in fact near-death experiencers become aware of [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4334.84s)]
*  basically they'll describe as understanding the universe how it all fits together how it's [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4341.56s)]
*  connected that drove me nuts when my early years of research I kept saying we'll share something [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4346.76s)]
*  bring back something we can use in our earthly life I'll check you right here because this reminded [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4353.24s)]
*  me it's not that you get the knowledge that the knowledge is like read to you as if you read it [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4357.32s)]
*  on a page and then you know the facts it's that the knowledge is suddenly in you yeah that's what [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4361.8s)]
*  it feels like you've got it bingo I just realized that I'm all yeah it's like it's not like you can [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4366.68s)]
*  you don't just you're like it's not like everything's revealed to you really it's just revealed in the [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4372.12s)]
*  sense that suddenly you know it or that the the revelation of it didn't even matter and then I [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4377.24s)]
*  can't even explain it again but but exactly you're going right down the path that I've heard from so [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4383.72s)]
*  many near-death experiencers I love it what they will become aware of is it's funny they often say [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4387.8s)]
*  it's so simple it's so easy well gosh not those of us on earth but you know what's interesting [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4393.72s)]
*  after years of studying these accounts and wondering why they didn't bring back something [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4399.72s)]
*  we can use one near-death experiencer taught me and said hey it's like an ocean of knowledge he [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4404.12s)]
*  was aware of and that can't fit into the teacup of our human brain and then I went oh I get it [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4410.4400000000005s)]
*  that's how limited we are in our earthly physical life right I've thought about that before too that [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4416.76s)]
*  I wonder if we just don't have the means as limited as we are yes to under to eat just and there's [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4421.64s)]
*  nothing wrong with that it's just we're doing a great job we do a ton of you know seeking and [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4432.68s)]
*  wondering but even our ability to wonder is in not infantile because we're here we are discussing it [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4438.04s)]
*  but it's uh it's not able to know exactly to be known yeah and it's probably good that it isn't [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4445.24s)]
*  because we would really wilt I think if we almost knew it and I think that's true I'll tell you the [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4453.32s)]
*  awareness of this universal knowledge that's out there that we don't know one thing that that has [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4459.96s)]
*  led me to consider in my research is Theo that's just dang humbling I'm a doctor I'm a smart guy [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4466.04s)]
*  I blew through pre-med my work in three years so I thought I was pretty good but aware of this [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4472.68s)]
*  incredible knowledge that is far beyond anything I or anybody on earth could understand is really [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4478.6s)]
*  really humbling about how little we really know in the big in the big picture of things and it's [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4485.0s)]
*  kind of nice if you can embrace that yeah oh it takes the edge off well it tells there's a lot [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4490.68s)]
*  that we all need to learn and uh that's that kind of continues the scientist in me saying okay we're [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4495.8s)]
*  still uh we haven't got all of knowledge figured out there's just a vast universe out there just [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4501.72s)]
*  waiting to be understood and discovered and that's exciting but will we ever get it but [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4507.4800000000005s)]
*  and maybe we will and maybe you know and some of it is even us thinking about this together and [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4512.6s)]
*  having conversations like this you know and comparing somebody who's done a lot of research [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4517.320000000001s)]
*  with people who weren't under the influence of drugs unless you consider like somebody being [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4521.56s)]
*  you know falling off a cliff a drug or whatever being in a car accident but um and then somebody [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4525.8s)]
*  who's only had kind of unique experiences through drugs you know um and realizing that there's some [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4530.36s)]
*  similarities and and some like that are totally different what are some things that people talked [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4537.639999999999s)]
*  about the afterlife the one thing you said that was interesting was being able to make a decision [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4541.639999999999s)]
*  maybe to come or to go so there's some like it's almost like do you want to stay do you want to try [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4545.16s)]
*  this new thing you know uh that's interesting what else you know it's interesting what's interesting [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4551.4s)]
*  Theo is that when they're in that realm when they're in that beautiful unearthly realm feeling [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4556.36s)]
*  love and peace beyond anything new on their earthly life that's not unfamiliar they often say [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4561.4s)]
*  this is a strong sense of their real home and and not their earthly life and that's one reason they [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4567.719999999999s)]
*  want to stay there they know their friends family and loved ones that they leave behind [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4573.88s)]
*  are going to be okay that they too will be in that realm when their time comes it's that feeling you [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4578.759999999999s)]
*  get to when you hug somebody that you love i don't like that i like that a lot exactly that feeling [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4583.48s)]
*  it's almost it's not even about that you're happy that it's them you know but it's really not even [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4588.44s)]
*  for there's a little bit of sometimes in a moment in a hug where it's not even about them it's just [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4593.5599999999995s)]
*  about this like other little space that gets created kind of that just feels uh absolutely [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4598.2s)]
*  welcoming oh you know i'm talking about kind of yeah i love talking about love so we'll focus [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4607.799999999999s)]
*  on that but yeah when you've got a hug and you've got that intense sense of love you can understand [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4612.84s)]
*  in personal experience the words in the dictionary that it's like a connection like a unity [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4618.12s)]
*  and you often can feel that and because the love described in near-death experience is one of the [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4622.92s)]
*  most common words you see that they in the afterlife described in near-death experiences [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4627.8s)]
*  one of the most consistent themes amazingly is they do feel that that and they use a stronger [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4634.360000000001s)]
*  word the connection much more commonly saying it's a unity it's a oneness of of us and of everyone [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4640.2s)]
*  it's sort of like the super if you will ultra love is what our destiny is going to be in the afterlife [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4646.599999999999s)]
*  oh yeah that 70s love baby you know because the 2020s love is a little you know it's definitely [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4652.92s)]
*  it's got uh it's been i think it's been cut with something you know probably baby powder [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4661.08s)]
*  i you know i think it's definitely different but that 70s stuff that's [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4666.12s)]
*  yeah that was some pure love it seemed like back then um oh one thing that stood out in your book [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4669.4s)]
*  i remember reading that um that there was a that there that blind people had similar near-death [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4674.92s)]
*  experiences absolutely people of sight that is a very good point theo uh i interviewed vicki [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4683.4s)]
*  vicki was born totally blind oh wow so she's really all in oh to vicki vision was unknown [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4690.68s)]
*  and unknowable i interviewed her and you know you simply cannot explain vision how we see in [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4697.240000000001s)]
*  terms of the remaining other four senses impossible and so i'd be a great uh game show they're like a [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4703.88s)]
*  japanese game show you know that would be interesting we had a beautiful young blind lady will you bring [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4709.4800000000005s)]
*  bring her up we had a blind woman that came on here and we learned about being blind oh fascinating [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4713.8s)]
*  it was really really interesting great i interviewed vicki vicki she was very good at singing she was [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4718.44s)]
*  a professional singer so she was singing in a bar one evening which is what she did and was involved [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4725.24s)]
*  in a terrible auto accident and i'm gonna jump in on what you and many others are thinking wait a [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4731.799999999999s)]
*  minute she's blind no she wasn't driving okay she had an inebriated patron driving which was not a [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4736.919999999999s)]
*  good idea so bad crash so if you're drunk and you the last person you need to help you get home is a [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4742.84s)]
*  blind person yeah that she was probably not real helpful with navigating down well yeah it's just [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4749.08s)]
*  like and let them be dude they're doing their own thing you're drunk driver yeah very bad you know [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4753.8s)]
*  take somebody's that can see yeah well sorry whatever no well you know that's that just shows [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4759.56s)]
*  you know exactly the problem of drunk driving because he nearly killed her uh yeah well of course [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4764.76s)]
*  yes like yeah and you're like and you're like oh i'm so drunk at least if we get an accident this [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4770.84s)]
*  person won't even see what happened you know so they can't lie to the cops yeah there you go well [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4775.400000000001s)]
*  you know that's just the shit that guy was probably thinking probably well anyway so vicki was [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4780.28s)]
*  taken to the emergency room and the first time in her life that she had vision she was in what [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4786.68s)]
*  we've talked about that out of body experience consciousness over her body and it's interesting [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4792.6s)]
*  to understand her first emotional reaction of suddenly having vision which was unknown and [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4798.76s)]
*  unknown to her she was actually frightened because the sense of vision was so unfamiliar [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4804.52s)]
*  she was initially horrified what is this new sensation and she had to actually calm down [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4810.84s)]
*  and then finally correlated she didn't even know who that was down on the gurney below but it's [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4816.92s)]
*  only after vicki correlated the feel of her long hair man i can't do that well uh because i don't [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4822.76s)]
*  have long hair but vicki did so she had it if you need it she correlated a feel of her long hair [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4829.320000000001s)]
*  an interesting ring that her father had given her she only knew by the sense of feel and now [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4834.84s)]
*  she was seeing it from up above in an out of body experience so when she calmed down she then had a [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4841.16s)]
*  tunnel experience had a review of her life that life review and went on into those unearthly [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4847.24s)]
*  heavenly realms beautiful highly detailed and highly visual near-death experience but with a twist [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4852.76s)]
*  feo her vision as she was explaining it to me was what we hear from many people that have near-death [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4860.12s)]
*  experiences is so-called 360 degree vision amazingly she's simultaneously understanding [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4865.96s)]
*  vision in front of her behind her right left up down the proper term would actually be like [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4872.84s)]
*  spherical and that was the vision she knew so when i told vicki that those of us in our earthly life [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4877.56s)]
*  have these pie-shaped visual fields because where our eyes are in the skull vicki laughed at me [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4883.24s)]
*  she said that just can't be she didn't get it couldn't grasp it because her whole life experience [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4891.0s)]
*  with vision was that spherical vision wow wow that's so fascinating and then she came back here [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4896.2s)]
*  and didn't have any more vision she yeah so when she returned to her earthly body vicki was back [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4901.96s)]
*  to being totally blind and i mean this is pure blindness no sense of light no partial vision at [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4907.16s)]
*  all i mean this is like to her vision unknown and unknowable interestingly and i asked her [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4913.64s)]
*  did you see colors well how could she answer that she had no life experience of knowing what color [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4919.72s)]
*  is she said she knew she'd seen which is she knew she so it almost makes you believe that there's [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4925.24s)]
*  just a one sense then it's a holistic sense so then what why i wonder why we get stuck here [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4929.4s)]
*  in these that these entities that only have five senses then we almost feel like a split end of [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4936.36s)]
*  you ever seen like a split end of hair like you know like when we get they split ends hairs or [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4943.799999999999s)]
*  something and their hair it looks like it's been doing drug your search rattled you know it's that [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4947.5599999999995s)]
*  that hadn't had it it's not been doing well there yeah and uh and so um that's how i feel [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4951.96s)]
*  something like a human where this erratic or if you see a live wire on the ground and it's just [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4959.08s)]
*  it's not connected but it's like you know just that's how i feel like humanity is where this [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4963.24s)]
*  split end of existence that's that's frayed kind of from what it seems like even nature is like [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4968.4400000000005s)]
*  nature even though it's violent and it's beautiful it's everything at the same time it's decaying [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4974.36s)]
*  it's birthing it's like this um it's um it's constantly occurring right it's and we sometimes [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4978.68s)]
*  feel like this weird thing that's able to stick our head out of nature and just look around at it [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4986.6s)]
*  right we don't know what we're really grasping we're trying our best some of us are you know [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4992.4400000000005s)]
*  wearing driving gloves and thinking we're neat but most of us like fucking dude we don't know [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=4997.320000000001s)]
*  what's going on here anyway i don't know if that makes any sense but yeah i think it does i think [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5002.360000000001s)]
*  it shows like you know here we're so used to our five earthly senses and yet so many ways are [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5007.16s)]
*  limited i mean you hear these accounts like vicki and you go wow our senses uh in the afterlife are [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5012.28s)]
*  going to be much much more than we possibly knew here i mean it's it's just really breathtaking to [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5020.12s)]
*  think about how consciousness functions were not limited by who we are what we are in our earthly [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5025.48s)]
*  life i mean we're stuck with our vision our hearing sensation you know we got five senses [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5030.76s)]
*  and that's it you know at least for most of us those yeah and there's some pretty door-to-door [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5036.92s)]
*  senses they're nothing real you know they seem like kind of over-the-counter senses under the [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5040.84s)]
*  counter which one's the which one you got to get a prescription for yeah i like they're kind of uh [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5045.88s)]
*  kind of they can be marginal i mean medically you know we see people that have impairment in their [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5050.52s)]
*  senses and that's that's very very sad so but which one you get drugs for which one do you [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5055.08s)]
*  have to get a prescription for over the counter or under the counter oh over the counter is oh [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5058.76s)]
*  yeah so these are just under the counter senses these are just like basic you know like your [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5061.88s)]
*  regular shelved senses you know on the shelf senses yeah nothing special it doesn't feel like [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5065.400000000001s)]
*  anything special yeah and and yet you know it's all we got to live on it's well shoot i guess [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5070.2s)]
*  one way of looking at it you know it's kept us alive for all of our lives i'm not i'm grateful [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5074.92s)]
*  but i think when we start to look at vicki since even a blind person coming back and saying look [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5080.12s)]
*  you guys can have your vision or whatever bs you do whatever two-dimensional bs you guys are [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5084.76s)]
*  looking around and stuff that's fine just knowing on that next level that you get all the uh you [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5089.5599999999995s)]
*  know you get like uh all the all the you get everything that they have exactly i mean we're [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5095.16s)]
*  not limited you know what i think too sometimes dr long is like i used to have this theory that [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5101.639999999999s)]
*  like um four-legged animals right they complete a circuit right because they're on the earth right [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5105.639999999999s)]
*  there's four legs they complete a circuit and then us somehow we ended up two we're two-legged [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5112.92s)]
*  so we're kind of have these loose ends all the time and i feel like we're we're we're just this [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5119.72s)]
*  uncompleted circuit sometimes and that's sometimes how i think why we that's something that happened [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5125.96s)]
*  to us we're we're maybe supposed to be more four-legged because you look at some two-legged [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5135.24s)]
*  animals kangaroos i think are two-legged and they are yeah they're obtuse brother they're they're [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5139.56s)]
*  bouncing they're fighting they have children on them they're just like us really they're like us [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5145.160000000001s)]
*  at disney world you know and it's like so that's i that was a theory i had like a year ago or [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5149.64s)]
*  something that popped into my head i was like why do we not fit sometimes with nature at ease you [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5156.200000000001s)]
*  know you know that's an interesting point because you know we're we're so much of nature is that [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5161.64s)]
*  four-legged and and you know it's fairly consistent in terms of how animals go around [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5167.0s)]
*  it here we're the anomaly we're not that's the thing we're the anomaly we're not the norm [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5171.8s)]
*  we're the why did we end up the anomaly and i and but then you start thinking well is there a higher [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5175.72s)]
*  power that wants us to be the anomaly that's taken us from this four-legged and stood us up [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5179.96s)]
*  to have some enlightenment which i also think is very to me feels very uh warm and wanting [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5184.68s)]
*  you know so um and it could be a mix of the two i don't know i'm just thinking out loud [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5192.6s)]
*  what have you garnered from uh speaking with people who have been close to the afterlife and [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5196.6s)]
*  um what have you garnered from that oh that's that's where my research gets amazingly interesting [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5202.76s)]
*  what i'm seeing is well the oh it's a basic scientific principle that what's real is [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5209.0s)]
*  consistently observed and that's where it's exciting when you look at the afterlife in near [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5213.88s)]
*  death experiences because what's described now times thousands is so amazingly consistent i mean [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5218.92s)]
*  it's a beautiful unearthly realm that strong sense of peace and love but off the scale beyond [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5225.64s)]
*  anything they knew in their earthly life the encounters with deceased loved ones interactions [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5231.88s)]
*  by the way deceased pets are often described in near-death experiences and these are again joyous [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5237.400000000001s)]
*  you know for animal lovers out there tremendously good news from near-death experiences i mean hey [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5243.4800000000005s)]
*  you name it dogs cats birds horses i've seen not rats whenever you pet well i mean i haven't [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5249.320000000001s)]
*  heard that but you know certainly couple of are are not it's not at all unusual and like other [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5255.88s)]
*  deceased humans that they knew these are joyous reunions and you know sort of back to that sharing [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5262.200000000001s)]
*  like they did on earth only here they are in the afterlife so so do they see that they see these [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5267.88s)]
*  people in the afterlife what do people say they physically see they see their father cousin or [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5272.92s)]
*  grandparent or something yeah they see them in the way that they saw them on earth not is there [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5277.8s)]
*  any information about that yo lots how do people see people when they when they have a near-death [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5283.72s)]
*  experience how do former humans that they knew or humans that they knew on earth that are now gone [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5288.2s)]
*  how do they see them in uh in the ndes right they're essentially always picture perfect health even [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5294.76s)]
*  if they died of an advanced age or a disfiguring debilitating accident or injury when they're [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5301.08s)]
*  encountered in the afterlife they're essentially always absolutely picture perfect health interestingly [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5307.0s)]
*  if someone died in an extremely advanced age they may appear even decades younger and if they died [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5313.08s)]
*  in very early childhood amazingly they may appear in older childhood no really and so it seems to be [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5320.44s)]
*  that kind of interplay usually yeah usually they look pretty much you know and they can tell [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5327.16s)]
*  another interesting thing you almost never have people say mary is that you it's it's an [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5332.6s)]
*  immediate and intense deep understanding that this is their beloved they can share from issue [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5339.56s)]
*  you know what they had and experienced in their past life um there's a predisposition for genetic [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5346.68s)]
*  relatives but you can be anything obviously spouses or uh you know pretty much it friends [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5351.72s)]
*  loved people so it again a beautiful beautiful part of near-death experiences where you have [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5357.72s)]
*  that joyous reunion and in fact even if the earthly life was strained in the afterlife it's [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5363.240000000001s)]
*  that's not an issue anymore there's joyous sharing there can be sort of like the analogous of [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5370.68s)]
*  interaction touch you can't really touch right on physical but there's certainly a lot of that kind [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5376.68s)]
*  of very close sharing and interaction a very beautiful very touching part of near-death [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5381.72s)]
*  experience so there's no like needing to get over past things everything's just equal there [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5387.240000000001s)]
*  yeah that i i i i that makes so much sense man i think even i think whenever i did some dmt or [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5391.64s)]
*  something my feeling was just that these intricacies the are these idiots these idiot ways that we [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5398.68s)]
*  interact with each other and how we treat each other it's all so pointless to the act to what [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5405.8s)]
*  it all the whatever that value was at we're like yeah it's like there's a whole like equation going [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5413.4800000000005s)]
*  on and we're over here like on a um one of those nimbus counters whatever is it or no that's a [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5420.6s)]
*  cloud but like one of those like little you know that i don't know i'm talking about dude jesus [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5424.92s)]
*  christ but um right but i do understand that i mean it's it's like we're infantile and [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5429.320000000001s)]
*  understanding understanding that the value of each other right and here we have our earthly [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5435.32s)]
*  things that separate us those anger resentments jealousy and yet none of that absolutely i wish [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5440.2s)]
*  everybody on earth could hear you say that to you none of it matters when you're on the afterlife [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5446.36s)]
*  because you're letting go of all those things that that kept us apart that separated on earth [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5450.5199999999995s)]
*  and here we are in the afterlife intensely feeling unified connected one with everyone and everything [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5456.36s)]
*  um literally you know a concept of super love if you will yeah so then why does this happen why are [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5463.5599999999995s)]
*  we on this leg of life do you think do you able to grasp does anybody get that sort of information [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5472.04s)]
*  or it doesn't really go there it's just more of this okay now i'm this there's the opportunity [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5477.48s)]
*  when you die to get and be embraced into this ever laugh this everlasting warm love all-knowing [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5483.24s)]
*  place but do they get any intel on why we're in this realm now yes i asked a specific survey [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5490.76s)]
*  question if during their near-death experience they got any specific information about the [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5498.52s)]
*  meaning and purpose of life so the oh i've had hundreds and hundreds of people give that [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5503.56s)]
*  narrative response in direct answer to that question and what is fascinating is that our [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5508.280000000001s)]
*  earthly life first of all very important what we learn here lessons about love relationships [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5513.8s)]
*  what we experience is important but way more important than we could have possibly known it [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5520.68s)]
*  seems to ripple through an eternity and through the lives souls of many many other people so [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5525.8s)]
*  that was fascinating for me to understand that as they kept getting these narrative responses so [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5531.8s)]
*  there is value to what we learn here that's what you're saying yeah oh absolutely there is value [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5536.200000000001s)]
*  and it's it seems to be extremely important and here's another concept which a lot of people [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5540.120000000001s)]
*  wouldn't think of and that is you know all we know here is our earthly life i mean this just seems to [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5544.84s)]
*  sometimes drag on forever yeah but our real consciousness our real beings is that which is [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5550.52s)]
*  eternal and infinite this physical earthly life that we're living seems to be the tiniest slice [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5557.4800000000005s)]
*  of our eternal existence this is literally the one time during our eternal existence when we can know [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5564.040000000001s)]
*  non-eternity non-infinity limitations what an interesting way to think about it that is that [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5570.4400000000005s)]
*  is literally as opposed to trying to be told or learn from other people's experience there is no [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5576.84s)]
*  other way for us to learn all that we do in the physical earthly realm of life other than to [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5584.2s)]
*  experience it right as a tiniest slice of our infinite existence wow because yeah you you think [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5590.28s)]
*  like man i want to get back there where everything's interesting but maybe when you're there you're [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5596.84s)]
*  like dude we got to go back to earth where everything's all kind of piecemeal and weird [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5601.24s)]
*  and you got to figure it out and you hit puberty or whatever and shit's strange you know absolutely [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5604.76s)]
*  i mean it's only during a physical earthly life i mean with the afterlife you're not going to have [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5609.8s)]
*  that anger you're not going to have that want you're not going to have you don't even remember any [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5614.4400000000005s)]
*  of that oh yeah absolutely it doesn't matter if you saw somebody that you hated there's not even [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5619.320000000001s)]
*  the all of that friction or whatever doesn't exist i don't think in the afterlife well you've got that [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5624.04s)]
*  yeah but feel you've got that overwhelming sense of love and compassion and connection i mean you're [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5628.6s)]
*  really think you would forgive somebody or you don't even have to forgive him it's just known [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5634.36s)]
*  it's i think it's a you there's one thing that's overriding in the afterlife is free will you have [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5638.5199999999995s)]
*  the free will choice to forgive someone or not to forgive but shoot that's what they say in the [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5645.16s)]
*  afterlife well that's what we see for many near-death experiencers describing is you have [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5649.799999999999s)]
*  free will over there you you would have i think if out of free will you would have the ability to [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5654.12s)]
*  hold a grudge and yet i don't even know that i've seen any near-death experiencers describe that in [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5660.04s)]
*  other words this is completely off the scale in terms of love peace that sense of connection [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5666.36s)]
*  that sense that on our earthly life even if we made mistakes and geez we all did oh yeah i know [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5673.56s)]
*  i did oh i know that those referees who call didn't call that past interference about six years ago [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5678.44s)]

*  the afterlife you know what i thought about that i can let a lot of stuff go man but those guys [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5693.8s)]
*  they just they should not have done they should have figured that out well anyway maybe i will [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5698.28s)]
*  you're right i'm sorry yeah but you have the choice you'll probably have the choice to do that and yet [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5702.76s)]
*  you'll understand that in a realm where literally the guiding force is love that that might not be [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5706.360000000001s)]
*  loving and so that might not be who you are at that point in time and i think it's i know it's [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5711.88s)]
*  it's tough to it's tough to put yourself in the mindset of that infinite eternal beyond earthly [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5717.879999999999s)]

*  the the world this earthly world didn't matter it's but there but then there must be some long-term [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5750.4400000000005s)]
*  thing to it but but like you're saying it does it does matter to be here and exist and go through [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5756.2s)]
*  this my friend megan sheehy she's like a therapist in uh oregon and she's really a really neat [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5761.0s)]
*  thinker and a deep thinker and she um she would say sometimes that some of our souls some souls [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5766.68s)]
*  that you come across and some of our souls and maybe me and and maybe you and are like baby souls [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5773.0s)]

*  and they're just like oh some of them been here a long time maybe and they're you know they're [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5786.44s)]
*  smoking or whatever and they're you know they're complaining outside of the library but some of [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5790.44s)]
*  them is their first time and they're like you know having a blast or just i don't know i thought [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5794.68s)]
*  that was kind of a interesting school of thought that she shared with me one time yeah it's a [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5799.56s)]
*  concept of old souls you know i've heard of that before right you heard of that before i just never [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5804.200000000001s)]
*  heard of the young so i'd never really thought of the the other side of it that that's that it's some [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5808.4400000000005s)]
*  soul it's just like they're fresh out of the bat you know the the bassinet they're just you know well [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5812.360000000001s)]
*  if you have old souls you have young souls yeah i didn't put it together a little binary but again [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5817.240000000001s)]
*  i think it's all you know in the afterlife i don't i don't know there's really a judgment or that it's [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5821.56s)]
*  so critical i think we're all here to learn um there you know we're all here to share interact [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5827.48s)]
*  with each other and learn from those relationships and grow from those relationships i mean that's [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5832.919999999999s)]
*  going to be a part of the consciousness of who we are what we are and and literally what we can share [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5837.24s)]
*  with eternal consciousness uh you know on an ongoing basis so it's really that important it's [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5842.919999999999s)]
*  not just our consciousness it's what we can do as a group it's what we can yeah it's literally [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5847.639999999999s)]
*  there's a shared consciousness i love there's a shared knowing and so that's what we talked about [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5852.52s)]
*  briefly earlier about like a ripple effect of consciousness so what we do in earthly life the [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5857.080000000001s)]
*  choices we make the love that we express is actually literally rippling through eternity [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5862.200000000001s)]
*  far more important than we realize that we could possibly know here man i love that that's such a [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5867.56s)]
*  great thought man it's such a great theory too and it's one that we need to put out there more [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5872.52s)]
*  and i i feel like um we're getting more i feel like that is gonna become i think we're starting [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5876.68s)]
*  to realize that these these ways of like immense greed and like putting each other at like massive [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5884.68s)]
*  amounts of people at paying for profit and just yeah and it just there's no what is the long-term [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5893.320000000001s)]
*  value of it well i don't see anybody that think what is the long-term value of oppressing a people [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5899.320000000001s)]
*  or of you know it's like we have to be evolving out of that and it's like i i i think a lot of us [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5906.2s)]
*  are starting to see that like it does because the only way we all have to be here and it's like we [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5912.92s)]
*  have you have to find a way where it all works out you know and some of these um archaic ideas of [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5920.599999999999s)]
*  greed and of uh just um i don't know well i think about that stuff a lot i like that because after [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5928.360000000001s)]
*  all you know the old adage you can't take it with you i mean if you spend your life being greedy [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5937.72s)]
*  and hoarding and and you know material possessions none of that is going to exist in a physical [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5943.320000000001s)]
*  afterlife but what is going to be a part of you your soul is going to be those loving outreaches [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5949.400000000001s)]
*  you had it's going to be those times that you really showed compassion and that is going to be [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5955.16s)]
*  what helps define us our eternal soul and will ripple out and be a part of us forever i agree [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5961.5599999999995s)]
*  with you and but we can do that as a bet i think our leadership and how we choose to can do that [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5967.16s)]
*  like i like i don't know i i'm not like a socialist really i don't think but i i guess i am a person [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5973.639999999999s)]
*  that like that i believe people should be capped on kind of the amount of money that they can make [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5981.0s)]
*  i don't believe that corporate like we should i don't think we should sacrifice the good of people [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5985.8s)]
*  the betterment overall betterment of people and of your experience on earth uh for technological [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=5991.72s)]
*  advancement for profit i don't i like i don't know i haven't fully conceptualized some of my ideas and [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6001.4s)]
*  i don't know what they are but i just see how it just makes it sick it's like we could just [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6007.0s)]
*  we could have better lives overall it feels like but then maybe part of the reason that we're here [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6012.92s)]
*  is to have this struggle and to see these things and to know what um what the ups and downs feel [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6017.08s)]
*  like and to know what it feels like not to care about each other as much as we should you know so [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6023.56s)]
*  that when you do go to that other place it's like oh this makes so much sense you nailed it it's the [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6028.12s)]
*  struggle we're having struggles here all of us you know the needs the wants the the you know the [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6033.48s)]
*  thinking that we should be agreed you know the the desires we have to you know struggle with just [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6039.719999999999s)]
*  being human i wonder if we do better do we evolve like wonder if we if at a certain point we do like [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6045.799999999999s)]
*  decent good enough then god gives us another sense like now you got this sense boys and you're like [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6051.0s)]
*  whoa bro so i wonder if we can evolve if we all got to a level of of caring about each other or [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6056.36s)]
*  of doing something you know and i know that shit sounds kind of hoity-toity and we are the world [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6064.599999999999s)]
*  and magic johnson or whatever or michael johnson molested those kids or whatever i'm not saying all [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6069.0s)]
*  of that but i'm just saying like if we all got to a level where we could like could we like do we get [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6073.639999999999s)]
*  to go to another level if we can beat this level on earth absolutely i think that's a a beautiful [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6081.08s)]
*  statement of a hope of a vision for humanity if we can all learn about the importance of love [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6087.88s)]
*  compassion sharing um let go of those all too human greed once uh you know the incredible [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6093.16s)]
*  disparities in material goods around the world which is just incredible if we could let go of [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6101.64s)]
*  that if we could all know that we are one we are one world one people if we could just visualize [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6107.72s)]
*  that work towards making it happen absolutely yeah we as a humanity could evolve and evolve in a very [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6114.6s)]
*  positive and we unlock a new sense and we would yes and i think that that is a great expression [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6120.92s)]
*  of hope so good i like your attitude too dr long and look obviously i'm sitting here in a warm room [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6125.64s)]

*  gonna burn down every moment of my own life or like achievement or something just to try and [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6138.76s)]
*  say that that idea isn't possible you know it's like obviously we're privileged enough to be able [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6146.52s)]
*  to say that you know or whatever you know we have microphones we have whatever you know we have [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6150.84s)]

*  about this and and yet we're learning about the importance of these values from near-death [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6160.84s)]
*  experiences from our own lives i mean it's that seed of compassion that i think every human being [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6166.4400000000005s)]
*  has it's just a matter of bringing that out helping people to manifest that and how it would change [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6171.56s)]
*  the world if we all understood that and different ethnicity different places different people they [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6177.96s)]
*  have less of it than others i think different people because we all have different pieces of [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6183.400000000001s)]
*  each other's lock you know like we're all the keys to each other's locks that's what my friend [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6187.48s)]

*  and it's a good message and i don't mean that but i don't want to get to the point where we sound [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6201.799999999999s)]
*  like we're just like we know like we're trying to save the world the hope this hope i'm gonna stay [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6205.5599999999995s)]
*  out of our yeah and yet the hope for humanity that we are expressing very directly here [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6212.04s)]
*  is directly part of the near-death experience wisdom over and over we're understanding those [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6217.08s)]
*  concepts and that's directly relevant to the the greater truth the greater understanding and [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6221.96s)]
*  literally the hope for world that people that have near-death experience experiences bring out [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6227.64s)]
*  yeah now what about this dude they say what's if somebody's gonna die and they're not gonna do [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6232.76s)]

*  awesome conversation so carry on what you got there yeah and i'm grateful this book man i'm [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6325.0s)]
*  i'm grateful just like you know that there's somebody who wants to care enough to think [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6330.28s)]
*  about this and collect this information because it's it's kind of tedious i'm sure it is my [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6335.32s)]
*  literally my second full-time job and a big shout out to my wife jodie she is a licensed attorney [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6341.4s)]
*  and yet she stepped down from doing that so she could devote full time to running the website and [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6347.32s)]
*  working to gather this information and share it back with the world the experiences the near-death [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6352.6s)]
*  experiences shared with us freely it's wonderful that we have the opportunity to share them back [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6357.320000000001s)]
*  freely literally in over 30 different languages so people all over the world can read these [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6362.280000000001s)]
*  if you go to the website nderf.org go to the home page you'll quickly realize yeah we don't have [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6367.72s)]
*  anything for sale and we don't solicit donations why but that doesn't seem like the typical [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6373.64s)]
*  materialistic viewpoint it's because we know that the information we have the experiences we're [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6379.0s)]
*  sharing are so important we don't want to compromise the integrity of that by having [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6384.12s)]
*  any commercial interest right on the home page okay got it that's fair i respect that man i [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6388.28s)]
*  think there's certainly ways to do that sort of thing and and there's ways also not to feel [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6392.92s)]
*  embarrassed about it you know like i think from listening to you i don't i think i can [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6396.6s)]
*  people's instincts usually are what they are and everybody will make their own decision as to if [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6402.36s)]
*  somebody thinks you're some sort of a snake oil salesman or something but that's not what i gather [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6406.04s)]
*  um and they and we do that for everyone you know we do that on all types of things [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6410.12s)]
*  i'll tell you this i accidentally bought four copies of the book and one audio copy of evidence [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6413.96s)]
*  of the afterlife because uh yeah i had i didn't know where i was going to be and so i um if i [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6419.48s)]
*  was going to be here la so i bought one and then uh my friend got me one and then i bought an audio [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6426.04s)]
*  uh copy as well but i don't have god in the afterlife this is a different book yeah that [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6431.56s)]
*  came out later and that's where we went into the deeper if you will spiritual content of near-death [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6435.4s)]
*  experiences concepts of god which i want to hasten to add many near-death experiences say [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6440.839999999999s)]
*  god is a human word and what they encountered in god is far beyond human language far more [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6447.0s)]
*  you know they would are concerned about being limited in what they encountered by using [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6453.879999999999s)]
*  typical english verbal expressions of that which is beyond the verbal beyond language in god [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6459.72s)]
*  but also great deal of writing in this book about love and the concepts of that that seems to be if [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6466.4400000000005s)]
*  you will the glue that holds the universe together and what we've alluded to earlier [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6472.12s)]
*  the overwhelming consistent comments from people that have been in that unearthly heavenly realm [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6476.4400000000005s)]
*  that amazing concept that we're all one we're all unified we're all together uh and forever which [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6481.88s)]
*  is again completely different from conventional western religious thinking and yet by the literally [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6488.36s)]
*  at this point thousands we have people that have near-death experiences sharing that yeah yeah no [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6493.88s)]
*  i think uh that that's interesting so people so that one's a little bit more of a religious aspect [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6499.88s)]
*  this has nothing to do with religion this is purely evidence-based this is purely what people [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6505.08s)]
*  having okay their experience of what of any interactions with what they perceive to be god [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6509.88s)]
*  and you're saying that overall that experience was that the god that they perceived or the energy [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6514.84s)]
*  of a higher power or of a more all-knowing power was greater than something we could actually [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6519.64s)]
*  conceptualize and the best we can do with that here on earth is by saying god absolutely god is [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6525.56s)]
*  just the most common word i mean you know there's really no other right well it goes to the senses [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6530.52s)]
*  it goes to the senses of this is the best we can do with the five senses we have is create this um [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6535.320000000001s)]
*  this this uh lower level according now we if we believe in this higher level that of uh of [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6543.320000000001s)]
*  communication and of sharing an idea of something yeah absolutely yeah that's you got it you nailed [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6552.200000000001s)]
*  it there theo thanks dude it only you know it only took us two hours to do it oh so what about have [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6558.76s)]
*  you have you had anyone who had a near-death experience from like a um a uh like a mass [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6564.76s)]
*  like a 9 11 or a school shooting or a mass death type of scenario was there anything like that [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6574.2s)]
*  ever i know you said there was one where there was two people yeah have you had anybody report [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6579.64s)]
*  from something greater like that wow you know that's a good question you know fortunately mass [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6584.360000000001s)]
*  sudden deaths mass shootings mass things like that are very very rare you know virtually all [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6589.48s)]
*  people that die it's going to be you know their individual death that accident illness advanced [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6595.639999999999s)]
*  age that kills them i can't right off the top of my head think of any near-death experiences that [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6601.16s)]
*  occurred at a time of a very mass death that have been shared with but i'll sure keep my eyes out [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6606.04s)]
*  for one yeah yeah i'm just wondering if there's too much death in one moment at that place for [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6611.5599999999995s)]
*  the other side to like really you know maybe they have to just um you know maybe they don't have as [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6616.28s)]
*  much of a uh intake you know person working that day or whatever where you have enough time with [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6622.2s)]
*  them you know i'm saying you don't i don't know where you know because i imagine that some things [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6628.2s)]
*  would be a little bit similar maybe that's like all right everybody get in here you know you can't [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6632.36s)]
*  loiter you know uh i don't think we have to worry about that the every hint of information about the [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6635.88s)]
*  afterlife is as overwhelmingly more intelligent loving and i think there's an immediate [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6641.48s)]
*  sort of aware entry into the afterlife for anybody who's permanently deceased on this world [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6648.919999999999s)]
*  any celebrities have reached out to you any interesting folks like that or like people [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6655.799999999999s)]
*  you know that are any like interesting folks that have reached out to you to be more curious about [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6659.24s)]
*  yeah we do periodically hear for some i mean you name it doctors executives uh some people that [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6666.04s)]
*  don't want their name mentioned but yeah we've had some people very interested in this that have [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6672.5199999999995s)]
*  contacted me you know like are you sure dr long are you do you really be how what is the evidence [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6677.08s)]
*  behind it can you share it with me so we've i've banded with some people uh way up the food chain [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6682.76s)]
*  if you will in this society that are fascinated with this research and want sort of a one-on-one [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6687.48s)]
*  perspective so yeah i've done that there there's plenty of i mean how can you not be fascinated [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6693.32s)]
*  about what happens after you die so you know people that are you know well to do that are [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6698.679999999999s)]
*  famous literally have those same interests that i think everybody does certainly at least some [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6704.28s)]
*  point in their life yeah well it's a big conversation that we have about death and [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6709.639999999999s)]
*  it's a lot of times it's a conversation i think that we have with ourselves but that we're really [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6713.799999999999s)]
*  afraid to have absolutely you know i don't know how much i have a conversation with myself about [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6717.4s)]
*  death and if i do what even is it really yeah like what do you know anything about that such [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6722.12s)]
*  an unknown is such a mystery oh i i think just about every person that's ever walked this planet [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6727.0s)]
*  you know like you have thought about this and and it's unknown or unknowable the good news is [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6732.04s)]
*  interestingly when people have a near-death experience as you might guess their fear of death [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6737.32s)]
*  drops dramatically from a person who's had a near-death experience these are called after effects [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6743.08s)]
*  that typically observe changes after a near-death experience and one of the most common [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6748.12s)]
*  is a dramatic reduction in their personal fear of death and that's no surprise now is it they [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6753.08s)]
*  know what lies beyond death's door because they personally experienced it they know it's wonderful [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6758.84s)]
*  and not to be feared yeah man that reminds me whenever i did that dmt man i remember i [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6764.04s)]
*  called my mother after i sent her a text and i said hey ma don't worry about getting older or [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6768.84s)]
*  dying it's not that big of a deal what we're doing here isn't as super important as we think it is [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6773.5599999999995s)]
*  and that everything's going to be way awesomer than you think it is um which is just interesting [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6778.2s)]
*  because that's the only time i think maybe that dmt experience was a little bit more like some of the [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6784.44s)]
*  near-death experience but i'm going to go and read i'm going to go check out that website and [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6789.719999999999s)]
*  and see what more information i can garner because this is really just it's neat to think about [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6793.639999999999s)]
*  but man yeah to get close now are there people who want to sign up and say hey put me under [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6798.84s)]
*  some type of a coma or something so i can try to have a near-death experience are there kind of [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6805.88s)]
*  like astronauts of death where they want to go into that darkness and see what they can [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6810.84s)]
*  get and come back are there people like that yeah fortunately people that have raised that [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6817.0s)]
*  possibility for having themselves have an induced death is first of all it's vanishingly rare thank [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6822.12s)]
*  goodness second of all nobody's ever going to do that that would be illegal unethical and that's [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6828.28s)]
*  not how you study near-death experiences i mean shoot look at this we've had thousands of people [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6834.28s)]
*  share their near-death experiences why should we put someone's life in jeopardy to just study what [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6839.16s)]
*  we can ask literally thousands tens of thousands probably around the world millions of people [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6845.24s)]
*  that have had near-death experience so there's absolutely nobody's going to do that right i see [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6850.2s)]
*  it from your side especially as a medical professional right but are there i'm dude i [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6854.679999999999s)]
*  bet we could damn do a sign up online you know i bet you get six people off twitter by midnight [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6858.84s)]
*  today who would do it you know who would let you put them under some sort of a thing and they would [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6863.8s)]
*  sign the you know the you know the red rover agreement or whatever if they don't come back [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6867.8s)]
*  or whatever i don't know what it would be called but i bet we could i bet there's a lot of people [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6873.0s)]
*  who'd be like near-death uh experienced or not so whatever who would want to just you know every [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6876.84s)]
*  other day maybe they maybe it's an every other day job you put them in a coma or something and [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6883.16s)]
*  say see what had and they try to come back around yeah sadly that's true i think there's a lot of [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6887.32s)]
*  people that so want to to incorporate that that wonderful message of near-death experience into [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6891.72s)]
*  their own life that they would be willing to risk it again illegal unethical and absolutely not [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6897.56s)]
*  a self-loving path which we see in near-death experiences so commonly that overwhelming [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6903.72s)]
*  importance of love that's not loving either themselves or to the individuals would put them [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6908.280000000001s)]
*  in a dying state that's it's really it's sort of like the lessons we learned from people that [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6913.56s)]
*  had near-death experiences as a result of suicide attempts they learned vividly that that's not the [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6918.52s)]
*  right thing to do that was a huge mistake right wow man this is this pretty this is pretty heavy [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6924.280000000001s)]
*  here the others but you don't have a lot of talks where things get this deep no and it's nice though [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6931.0s)]
*  i want to have more talks like this and i think you know even us just talking about some of these [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6936.28s)]
*  things like i want to have more talks about like greed and why do we live in this space because i [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6939.64s)]
*  think some of the sickness that we feel as humans these days that we like you know there's a lot of [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6944.52s)]
*  emotional unwellness and mental unwellness and i think a lot of it is just because of us we realize [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6949.64s)]
*  or we feel and we can't even maybe put words to it sometimes that we're sick of [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6958.6s)]
*  something we've created a way of being a way of treating each other and even some of us are at [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6967.240000000001s)]

*  starting to be able to see it a little bit does that make any sense to you or am i crazy [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6984.44s)]
*  no absolutely i like what you're saying i think there's you know there's sort of that [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6987.719999999999s)]
*  sickness innate in humanity i mean here we are you know self-focused focused away from other people [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6991.879999999999s)]
*  focused on our own interests and our own concerns our own wealth our own everything i mean it's [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=6999.799999999999s)]
*  literally you're getting down to values there's a sickness in the expression of values all around [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7005.799999999999s)]
*  the world today and that's a sad thing it's you know globally you could call it unloving and yet [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7010.68s)]
*  here in near-death experiences is that consistent message pointing to that's not the way that's not [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7016.4400000000005s)]
*  how life is to be lived you need to think about your neighbor you need to think about other people [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7022.84s)]
*  you need to reach out compassionately i mean it's literally a profound message of hope for all of [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7028.280000000001s)]
*  humanity and in fact these profound deep messages in the near-death experience are in my opinion [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7033.08s)]
*  the most profoundly positive message even conceivable for all of humanity wow it's crazy [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7039.32s)]
*  that we have to almost die to get a message of how to live you know that we have to get you know we [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7046.599999999999s)]
*  have all this life in front of us every moment in front of our eyes and you have to go that close to [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7051.799999999999s)]
*  the you know to that white vulture of the lord death and and go over there and feed him bird [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7056.2s)]
*  seed out of your dang hand to just even get a little bit of information from him and yet i think [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7062.12s)]
*  we need to if we do understand that that's the big picture that that's really a part of our real [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7066.2s)]
*  eternal and infinite existence and that we're all here to learn lessons to move closer to that [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7072.679999999999s)]
*  greater reality that we have that unity that love that compassion i mean i think that sets you know [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7078.36s)]
*  really a pathway that we can all think about each day of our daily lives and maybe move one step [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7084.679999999999s)]
*  closer to being our true selves which is what we're going to be in the afterlife right [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7090.84s)]
*  yeah man it's definitely uh it's definitely super fascinating it's interesting to think about i'm [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7098.04s)]
*  grateful that god let me exist to even kind of just get to think about stuff like this that's [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7104.68s)]
*  some sometimes the most fascinating thing about life and especially being able to stay alive and [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7109.24s)]
*  get older because you get to see more concepts of like that's one of the saddest things i think when [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7113.16s)]
*  people die young is they just don't get to see like how things kind of a little bit more clarity [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7118.12s)]
*  you get and and a little bit more light knowledge you get of what of of existing and stuff yeah [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7123.08s)]
*  absolutely was there anything else i was gonna ask you about man you really this has been a great [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7129.4s)]
*  interview has it been yeah you've really i mean you've really covered a lot of material here [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7134.84s)]
*  and very fascinating i love this different perspective that you're bringing out in this [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7139.16s)]
*  discussion here i think you're coming at the concept of near-death experiences in a very special [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7142.92s)]
*  and i think very important very positive way it's sort of that you need to think about near-death [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7149.4s)]
*  experiences are such a a all-encompassing we start talking about infinite and eternal [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7153.72s)]
*  consciousness in our self or souls i mean literally just coming at the concept of near-death [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7159.8s)]
*  experiences from so many different ways i have learned in this discussion here i've thought [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7164.76s)]
*  about things i haven't really thought about before so this has been great this has been very [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7169.4s)]
*  helpful to me personally and i'm sure the vast number of viewers as well oh thanks man yeah well [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7173.4s)]
*  i think it's you know yeah i just feel grateful that we got to chat about it dude honestly um [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7179.0s)]
*  you know it's nice to think about and it's nice to be just reminded about it you know [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7185.48s)]
*  it's interesting the things that we focus on and listen to and stuff do have an effect on [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7189.4s)]
*  how we feel and think and stuff you know i think sometimes yeah uh yeah i think it's important you [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7194.04s)]
*  know where we put our attention you know and the dark arts have really masterminded ways to take [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7201.48s)]
*  our attention and use it for evil i don't think they know they're doing it for evil they think [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7206.28s)]
*  there's other reasoning behind it but we just have to be careful where we put our attention you know [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7211.0s)]
*  that's the most important thing it's hard and i'm not preaching about it i suffer just like everybody [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7215.16s)]
*  else but to recognize that we suffer is kind of a or that we're that where we're trapped a little [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7220.2s)]
*  bit is is kind of interesting and good start that's really cool man what a neat hobby that turns into [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7225.5599999999995s)]
*  something fascinating when you look back on that part of it like your own attention to it and stuff [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7231.0s)]
*  what uh what gifts has it given you out of paying attention to it absolutely i have been profoundly [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7238.28s)]
*  affected by my study of near-death experiences as a physician and i'm practicing full-time this has [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7245.48s)]
*  helped me to be much more compassionate focused on the patients loving to them literally going [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7251.16s)]
*  the extra mile really being the kind of a doctor to my patients that i would want a doctor to be [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7257.0s)]
*  with me and in fact in the facility that i'm working at now patient satisfaction is measured [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7262.2s)]
*  by a national survey called press gaini for the past seven months the facility i'm working [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7267.799999999999s)]
*  yeah i've heard of that before you've heard of press gaini well how about you bet you probably [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7272.76s)]
*  haven't heard of this in the last seven months of the press gaini surveys in the facility i'm working [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7276.04s)]
*  with every single patient that was surveyed on every single question we were at the 99 [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7281.320000000001s)]
*  level based against national standards but again it shows and i want to emphasize i contributed to [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7287.4800000000005s)]
*  that by the compassion and love and attention and focus i give patients but that's a whole dang team [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7293.64s)]
*  that shares that value of compassion doing their best of making patients feel like you know it's [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7298.76s)]
*  their home away from home when they come in there that they're really being cared for each person [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7305.64s)]
*  as an individual so between me and the whole team there we have some of the highest patient [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7310.76s)]
*  satisfaction scores you're going to find anywhere the oh well that's congratulations yeah and i and [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7315.64s)]
*  no that's that's awesome that your own work has ended up uh that your own hobbies and interests [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7321.8s)]
*  have ended up inspiring you to do your original job better it really is um press gaini we had a [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7327.0s)]
*  corner in and he was talking about once press gaini they started calling people and asking them [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7335.0s)]
*  to rate how their experience right right that it started to affect that somehow the opioid [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7342.04s)]
*  those makers use the press gaini press gaini scores and the that the opioid makers were [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7349.32s)]
*  using the press gaini to somehow do you know i'm talking about at all yeah unfortunately uh i am [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7356.44s)]
*  suspicious that you know patients that were seeking narcotics and then would get that would [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7361.879999999999s)]
*  rank their health care team higher than if their health care team did proper medicine and didn't [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7367.24s)]
*  give them inappropriate opioids so i i hope that's not what this is but i i have a fear i just [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7372.36s)]
*  remembered literally when you said that i this is the only second time i've ever heard it go back to [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7378.919999999999s)]
*  the top please it says uh the u.s has let's get to the writing the u.s has been in the middle of an [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7382.36s)]
*  opioid crisis for the past decade deaths uh more than 150 people a day die from opiate we know all [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7390.04s)]
*  that stuff yeah and an interesting angle researchers have been looking if there's a direct or indirect [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7395.0s)]
*  link between press gaini scores and the opioid crisis press gaini is a company that has the [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7398.679999999999s)]
*  health care industry's largest database of patient caregiver and physician feedback which you're [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7402.5199999999995s)]
*  saying you guys have done a great job with and you think that a lot of that is because of your also [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7406.759999999999s)]
*  understanding of what people's potential life after their life on earth it has certainly helped [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7411.24s)]
*  me to be a more compassionate uh courageous doctor i mean i deal with patients oh these are people that [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7416.5199999999995s)]
*  are facing a life-threatening illness cancer is a scary word oh but with what i've learned about [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7423.96s)]
*  near-death experiences i can approach each patient with cancer in their journey of treatment and [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7429.16s)]
*  hopefully recovery and cure with increased hope with increased compassion um in a way that i i [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7434.92s)]
*  know uh is beyond what i could have done before i started studying near-death experience well yeah [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7443.0s)]
*  if you're a concierge for this more comfortable afterlife or existence even just a even if you [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7448.52s)]
*  just are collecting all the rumors of it that's very fascinating i think that would definitely [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7455.56s)]
*  warm me if i'm a someone who's really in severe pain i mean it warms me and i'm not in pain [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7459.32s)]
*  yeah um but yeah i just want to look at this but patients using prescription opioids to manage [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7463.24s)]
*  their pain are 32 more likely to report high patient satisfaction scores according to recent [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7468.04s)]
*  research out of dartmouth hitchcock medical center but here's my question is why if if a if a medical [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7472.6s)]
*  place gets a higher press gandy score do they get a is there a financial incentive to them [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7479.48s)]
*  i mean not directly i mean i'm not accusing you of anything i mean you just happen to be here when [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7484.04s)]
*  this is happening i don't want you to feel like oh no i'm not i'm not yeah okay i i haven't read [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7487.8s)]
*  that study so i can't really comment on the dartmouth study and and you'd really have to [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7492.2s)]
*  read it to to understand the nuances to to really interpret it i think accurately but [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7497.08s)]
*  you know as the study says that uh you know there's there's probably many different reasons that [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7502.76s)]
*  people could could rate their i think i get it health care team higher if they get more you know [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7508.2s)]
*  more opioids oh yeah i'm on an opioid damn i'll rate you know i'll rate my you know i'll rate my [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7515.0s)]
*  neighbor's violent son higher you know well or whatever you know what i'm saying i'll rate [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7519.4s)]
*  somebody parked in my driveway higher and i don't even know them you know but it this says the [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7523.24s)]
*  surveys promote an assumption that patient satisfaction is an index of physician competence [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7527.32s)]
*  but then what hospitals can do is they can say we have the highest score medical places because [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7531.799999999999s)]
*  yeah i was just curious because i remember he said that and i was like because he said he thought [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7536.759999999999s)]
*  some of the opioid crisis was influenced more by some part of the press gany but i couldn't [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7540.36s)]
*  understand what he was talking about and so we didn't go down that road so when you said it [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7546.36s)]
*  i just yeah and i'd have to look over the study because there's there's it's multifactorial i'm [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7550.2s)]
*  sure it's not a simple opioid you know it's not it's correlated not causal it could be for any [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7555.32s)]
*  medicine really if we give more medicine to our some of our clientele then they're some places [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7561.0s)]
*  are hypothet hyp hypothesizing well then they'll give us higher scores and if we get higher scores [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOGrMfcMPg&t=7565.799999999999s)]
