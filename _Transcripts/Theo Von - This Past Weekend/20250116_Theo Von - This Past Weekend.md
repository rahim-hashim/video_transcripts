*  How old is he? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=149.0s)]
*  He got loophole in, I think, 33, 34. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=151.0s)]

*  It's done in Florida. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=160.0s)]
*  So it's a yeah, he gets all of that three meals a day or like two and a half meals. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=162.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what they're doing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=167.0s)]
*  I feel is there a gym there? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=168.0s)]
*  I feel like you'd feel really good about yourself in the gym. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=170.0s)]
*  Like if you're just like, you know what I mean? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=172.0s)]
*  Like just like, yeah, I'm fucking wrecking these fools here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=174.0s)]
*  I'm the only one going hard. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=178.0s)]
*  That's a good point, dude. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=180.0s)]
*  Some guys just fucking look at this chump. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=181.0s)]
*  Some guys just zoned out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=185.0s)]
*  Some I was like, I was Mr. Olympian 1938. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=188.0s)]
*  Some dudes hopped up on E.D. pills. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=194.0s)]
*  You know, that's got to be the scary thing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=196.0s)]
*  I think when you get to a certain age is risking the erect going for the erection because of the blood. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=199.0s)]
*  Just moving all the blood to one. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=205.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=207.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You're probably going to you probably can't stand up to that battlefront. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah. But that's like there's got to be something. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=212.0s)]
*  It's probably a real compliment to a chick. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=215.0s)]
*  If you're like, I'm risking it all. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=217.0s)]
*  I'm risking it all just to try to fuck you right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=219.0s)]
*  That's the ultimate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=222.0s)]
*  Like nothing could be any better. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah. My grandfather lived in like a like I don't know what nursing home type deal for like a couple of years before he died. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=225.0s)]
*  He was really the people who work there. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=233.0s)]
*  It was just such a funny dynamic. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=236.0s)]
*  It was like all it was like all black people from like the inner city and then like old Jews and they all the black people who work there just roll in their eyes at these old people the whole time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=238.0s)]
*  My grandfather, every time I went to see him, he accused them of stealing from him. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=251.0s)]
*  None of these people were ever stealing from him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=255.0s)]
*  None of them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=256.0s)]
*  It was just pure racism. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=257.0s)]
*  Like it was just and it was like things that like he'd be like they took the art off the wall and I'd be like there was no art on this wall. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=259.0s)]
*  This is all in your mind. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=265.0s)]
*  He's like this is not now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=266.0s)]
*  He made me he made me move a dress. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=267.0s)]
*  I was like 12 and he made me move this big dresser to check if there was change behind it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=270.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=276.0s)]
*  And then there was nothing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=277.0s)]
*  I was like there's no change behind it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=278.0s)]
*  And he was like they stole it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=279.0s)]
*  And I was like wait there was supposed to be changed behind it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=281.0s)]
*  Like you were keeping your change. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=284.0s)]
*  That's the old Jewish change behind the dresser trick. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=285.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=289.0s)]
*  You're Jewish. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=290.0s)]
*  You're. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=292.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=293.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=294.0s)]
*  Are you Israeli too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=295.0s)]
*  Is that the same thing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=296.0s)]
*  No no no no. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=297.0s)]
*  Israel is the nation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=298.0s)]
*  I have nothing to do with that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=299.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=300.0s)]
*  But are but some are some Jew but someone's Jewish. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=301.0s)]
*  They're just there just means that they have family that's from Israel originally. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=305.0s)]
*  No not even necessarily. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=309.0s)]
*  It's just like you it's you know Judaism. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=310.0s)]
*  It's a weird thing because it's like a religion but then it's also kind of a race and then it's kind of a nationality with Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=313.0s)]
*  So basically a bunch of Jews went and started their own country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=319.0s)]
*  In Israel in the 40s. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=323.0s)]
*  These were Jews from Europe. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=324.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=325.0s)]
*  Went to you know now according to the Bible or whatever thousands of years ago we were all from there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=326.0s)]
*  But the Jews from Europe went and started there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=330.0s)]
*  But lots of other Jews just didn't leave Europe or didn't leave America. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=332.0s)]
*  And so they never had anything to do with Israel. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=335.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=338.0s)]
*  Oh okay. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=339.0s)]
*  But they still play on kind of like your you know come on you got to support us because we're for you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=340.0s)]
*  We're this is the Jewish state. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=346.0s)]
*  This is what protects Jewish people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=348.0s)]
*  So a lot of Jews do feel sympathy to Israel even the ones who don't have like any any connection even ones who have never been there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=350.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=355.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=356.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=357.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=358.0s)]
*  No that's interesting. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah because sometimes I wonder like yeah because I start hearing about like Jewish then I hear Zionist and Zionist means. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=360.0s)]
*  Zionist means I think technically speaking Zionist means you believe that Jews should have a homeland in what is now called the Jewish land. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=365.0s)]
*  So that's more like the belief that Jews should have this country over there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=374.0s)]
*  And then there now then there's like kind of a separation between that and someone could theoretically be a Zionist but also be like the way they're doing it over there is all wrong. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=377.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=383.0s)]
*  So you don't have to like support the government but Zionist typically means that but now it's just kind of become it's become shorthand for the Jewish people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=384.0s)]
*  So I think it's it's a very interesting comparison. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=386.0s)]
*  So I think it's a very interesting comparison because it's a very interesting difference between like the way that the Jews have been treated over there and the way they're being treated over there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=388.0s)]
*  when it over there is all wrong, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=395.0s)]
*  So you don't have to like support the government, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=397.1s)]
*  but Zionists typically means that, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=399.1s)]
*  but now it's just kind of become, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=400.78s)]
*  it's become shorthand for someone who supports Israel. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=402.58s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=405.82s)]
*  So it's somebody who supports the country Israel [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=406.84s)]
*  is Zionist. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=409.12s)]
*  And what's sometimes I see black Zionists, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=409.96s)]
*  is that just like, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=411.92s)]
*  is that like Zionism just like with a back beat or whatever? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=412.98s)]
*  Like what is it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=415.36s)]
*  Cause you know what I'm talking about? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=416.32s)]
*  Yes. That, well, those guys- [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=418.0s)]
*  And they're like, we're the reals. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=419.76s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know what is going on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=420.76s)]
*  Those guys, they were, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=423.5s)]
*  so I grew up in New York city and they would always be out [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=425.0s)]
*  like in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=427.68s)]
*  And there was no, let me tell you something. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=429.04s)]
*  And Theo, I mean, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=431.28s)]
*  I've come up around some incredibly talented comedians. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=432.6s)]
*  I've seen some of the best in the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=434.64s)]
*  There is no better comedy show than being like 15 [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=436.18s)]
*  and just sitting there and watching these guys. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=440.52s)]
*  They'd scream at people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=442.58s)]
*  And then people would get furious back at them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=444.02s)]
*  I've watched like they, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=446.38s)]
*  cause their thing is that they're the real Jews. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=447.72s)]
*  And then they get like little old Jewish men [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=449.6s)]
*  will start yelling at them. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=451.62s)]
*  And I'm like, no, you're not the real Jew. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=453.06s)]
*  I'm the real Jew. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=454.02s)]
*  And we would just be like stone teenagers, just watching. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=455.26s)]
*  Just loving it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=457.86s)]
*  It's like with the real slim savings, please stay in the, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=459.06s)]
*  you know? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=460.76s)]
*  Is that an okay Jewish joke to make or not? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=462.06s)]
*  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, it's good. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=463.9s)]
*  Just, yeah, sorry. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=467.64s)]
*  I thought that was pretty, that was pretty good. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=468.68s)]
*  No, so they, I don't know what their whole claim is. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=471.48s)]
*  I don't know, but they say they're the real Jews [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=473.78s)]
*  and the Jews are just pretending to be the Jews, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=476.08s)]
*  but they're really the white devils or something. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=478.34s)]
*  Yeah, cause that's a new thing I've been seeing. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=481.0s)]
*  I would see it and then sometimes I wouldn't see it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=483.0s)]
*  And now in different, when I'm in, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=485.08000000000004s)]
*  sometimes I'm performing in different cities, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=486.88s)]
*  you'll see a group of black Zionists [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=488.04s)]
*  and they're trying to get you in this something, you know? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=490.04s)]
*  And I can't tell what it is. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=492.02000000000004s)]
*  And, but yeah, and then you see, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  you hear a lot of different terms. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I was just curious about that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  Dave Smith, thanks for joining, man. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=498.58000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=500.32s)]
*  You are a comedian and a, I want to say like a politico, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=501.16s)]
*  is that fair to say kind of, or? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=505.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=507.04s)]
*  You're like somebody with a point of view. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=507.86s)]
*  Yeah, definitely that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm obsessed with politics and I talk a lot of shit about it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=511.22s)]
*  So yeah, I guess whatever you want to call that, but yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=514.9s)]
*  And you're very funny, man. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=517.5s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=518.9s)]
*  And you are a libertarian, is that right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=519.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=523.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=524.24s)]
*  And this is awesome, man, cause so much of my audience [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=525.44s)]
*  and me really, it's just like, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=526.7s)]
*  I don't know what a lot of the terminology is, right? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  Like even asking you about Zionists, like you hear it, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=531.34s)]
*  but you're like, what is it, right? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=533.98s)]
*  What is libertarian mean? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=535.82s)]
*  To me, it's basically just, it's the belief in like, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=538.84s)]
*  in self ownership, in non-aggression and private property. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=544.88s)]
*  Basically the idea of libertarianism is that like, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=548.72s)]
*  you own your body, you own your life, you ought to be free. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=551.46s)]
*  So long as you're not impeding on the rights [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=554.46s)]
*  of other people, you ought to be able to do [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=557.5s)]
*  whatever you want to do. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=559.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=561.0s)]
*  And so a belief in free market capitalism, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=561.84s)]
*  peace, non-intervention, and just basically the idea [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  of what most people think of Americanism as, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=568.42s)]
*  that like, oh yeah, you have freedom of speech, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=572.4599999999999s)]
*  you have the right to own a gun, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  you have the right to own some property, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=575.26s)]
*  you have the right to live your life the way you see best. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  And do libertarians believe in government? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=580.9s)]
*  Well, there's a range of different thoughts [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=585.14s)]
*  within libertarians. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=589.14s)]
*  To the extent that libertarians believe in government, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  we believe like the role of government [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=593.14s)]
*  is to protect people's liberty. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=594.64s)]
*  Government shouldn't be doing anything more than that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=597.3s)]
*  Like if they're doing anything more than that, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=599.34s)]
*  then they've become tyrannical. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=600.86s)]
*  Which I think is just objectively true. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=602.86s)]
*  Like no matter what, if government's doing anything [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=605.62s)]
*  that is more than just protecting property [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=609.58s)]
*  or protecting people, then it's always [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=611.96s)]
*  at the expense of someone. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  Even if they're giving somebody something, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=616.2s)]
*  they're taking it from someone else, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  because they don't actually have anything themselves. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=619.1s)]
*  Right, so like what would an example of that be? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=621.86s)]
*  I mean anything, like even if you just took it down [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=623.98s)]
*  to like if government is cutting a check to one person, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  well how do they get that check? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=629.3599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=631.16s)]
*  It's not like, you know what I mean, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=632.0s)]
*  like they didn't pool their money together. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=632.8199999999999s)]
*  Right, people did. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  They took it from someone. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=635.2399999999999s)]
*  They taxed one group of people to give it to another. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=636.4s)]
*  So any service falls within that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=638.92s)]
*  Got it, understood. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=641.64s)]
*  Cool man, yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=643.9599999999999s)]
*  Okay, so that's good information, thanks. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  What, let's talk about some things [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  that are happening right now. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=651.1199999999999s)]
*  One of the biggest ones right now is TikTok [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=652.04s)]
*  and the sale of it, right? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  Like there's a big uproar right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=656.5799999999999s)]
*  You see a lot of videos on TikTok about what to do [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=657.8599999999999s)]
*  if TikTok disappears, where to go. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=660.06s)]
*  People like, there's like safe rooms and shit. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=662.42s)]
*  I'm like, I think people are, they'll figure it out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=664.3399999999999s)]
*  But maybe some people won't. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=667.3399999999999s)]
*  What do you think is behind the TikTok ban? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  Do you think it's actually going to get banned? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=672.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm very unsure about the second question. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=674.54s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=677.12s)]
*  It'll be interesting. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=679.3s)]
*  I don't use TikTok, and so I don't really have a connection [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=680.38s)]
*  to like, but the people who love TikTok, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=684.54s)]
*  I've seen this too, they're losing their minds. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=687.16s)]
*  I think they are some type of addicted to it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=689.48s)]
*  What's behind it is really interesting. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=692.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think that that's like, it's kind of a, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  it's a microcosm of like kind of what's going on in general, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=697.88s)]
*  but TikTok very quietly to people who are not like on it [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  and not using it, but it became like the main [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=706.88s)]
*  like news source for young people. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=710.12s)]
*  And like in a crazy way that for people our age, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=713.22s)]
*  if you even think back to like when we were little kids, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=716.26s)]
*  it's so like, it's hard to even imagine that it's real. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=718.4200000000001s)]
*  It's like, oh, they, now these young people [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=721.26s)]
*  are connected to information in a way that totally [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=723.6600000000001s)]
*  like goes around older people at all. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=726.88s)]
*  They have nothing to do with it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=730.1800000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=731.5s)]
*  Like Nancy Pelosi is sitting there just furious. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=732.34s)]
*  Like, what is this? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=735.1400000000001s)]
*  No, they don't care about like, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  they don't even know the people on TV news, you know? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=737.7800000000001s)]
*  And so, okay, when I say this, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=741.58s)]
*  I'm not just like pulling this out of my ass. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=744.0400000000001s)]
*  Like there was like one, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=745.6800000000001s)]
*  it might've been the head of the ADL, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  but it was someone real high up in the ADL who said this. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=749.12s)]
*  And the anti-defamation league. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  And then there was a- [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=754.84s)]
*  Anti-defamation league. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  So they are, it's like graffiti or whatever. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, not exactly. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=759.24s)]
*  They're not, the name doesn't exactly describe what they do, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=760.5200000000001s)]
*  but they're one of these people. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=763.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes, in fact, it was him. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=765.2800000000001s)]
*  It was Greenblatt. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=766.4200000000001s)]
*  CEO of anti-defamation league. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=767.96s)]
*  They're a league that was started by Jewish people, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=769.68s)]
*  and it was kind of, at least at the beginning, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=773.28s)]
*  I think was to be whatever, fighting anti-Semitism [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  or exposing this stuff. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=780.36s)]
*  They've come to be an organization [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  that will really try to go after [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=784.16s)]
*  and ruin anybody who's critical of Israel. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=785.88s)]
*  Right, I saw they had some issue with Elon now. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=788.16s)]
*  I remember maybe a year ago or eight months ago [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=790.0s)]
*  or something, there was something with him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=792.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe that was ADL? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=793.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's possible. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=794.8s)]
*  One of the things that they were real upset about [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=797.9000000000001s)]
*  was that from October 7th, 23 up until now, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=800.26s)]
*  TikTok has just been dominated by [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=806.1800000000001s)]
*  anti-Israel kind of critical of this war. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=811.5s)]
*  That's where a lot of the young people [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=814.74s)]
*  are seeing all the images of the Palestinian babies [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=815.94s)]
*  dying and stuff. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=818.6600000000001s)]
*  The kids, people begging for food and stuff like that. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=819.6600000000001s)]
*  A lot of the ICC, when they tried to send, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=823.12s)]
*  condemn Netanyahu, that was loose on there. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=827.8000000000001s)]
*  Or it was real information. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=829.96s)]
*  Yes, yes, that's right. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=831.44s)]
*  And if you remember, it was really interesting to me, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=832.6s)]
*  but I don't know, what is it, like a year ago around now? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=835.6400000000001s)]
*  Osama Bin Laden's letter to America went viral on TikTok. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=838.7600000000001s)]
*  It was so fascinating for me. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=843.84s)]
*  I'm 41, and so I was 18 when 9-11 happened. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=846.0400000000001s)]
*  And then it's interesting to watch this whole new generation [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=851.72s)]
*  of 18-year-olds discover this for the first time. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=854.98s)]
*  And it's like, oh yeah, a whole thing went down. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=858.1s)]
*  And they're actually reading Osama Bin Laden's own letter [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=860.7800000000001s)]
*  about why he did it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=865.02s)]
*  Now, of course, they're young lefties, so a lot of times, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=866.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, they were like, Osama was right. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  And I'm not saying they took the best message from it, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  but it was interesting to watch them kind of engaging. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=874.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's like wearing that Che Guevara shirt. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=877.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=879.58s)]
*  You're like, I don't know exactly what he was doing, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=880.4200000000001s)]
*  but yeah, it seems like a vibe. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=881.7800000000001s)]
*  But then also to hear from a person [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=883.9s)]
*  who was labeled completely as horrible, right, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  as the enemy, like Osama Bin Laden was, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=889.78s)]
*  and to see some of their thoughts, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  To see how they believe that they came to be the enemy, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=895.62s)]
*  not taking a side in it, but just like, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=899.04s)]
*  it's kind of fascinating that you weren't able [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=901.2s)]
*  to really get some of those, in some places, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=903.46s)]
*  in some platforms, you might not be able to hear that view. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=906.38s)]
*  Well, I mean, imagine it was just like a personal thing. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=908.82s)]
*  If I told you I was in an argument [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=913.0s)]
*  with someone, like a mutual friend of ours, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=916.24s)]
*  and I was like, oh, me and this guy [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=917.92s)]
*  just got in a huge fight, and you were like, what happened? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=919.16s)]
*  And I was like, well, he's a monster, he's evil, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  he hates everything good, he's made of pure venom. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=924.56s)]
*  And I think you might be like, okay, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=927.6s)]
*  but what's really going on here? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=929.0s)]
*  Because it's not a matter of taking sides [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=931.4399999999999s)]
*  to just be like, he probably has a side too. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=934.16s)]
*  Right, he has a point of view. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=937.8s)]
*  He probably has a point. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=938.64s)]
*  And what the American people were told, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=939.48s)]
*  I remember when I was 18, was they hate us for our freedom. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=941.96s)]
*  And that was all you were allowed to think of Al-Qaeda [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  right after 9-11, was like, they did this [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=949.8800000000001s)]
*  because they hate freedom, they hate your mom, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=951.72s)]
*  they hate everything about our life, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=954.44s)]
*  they hate everything that's good, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=955.84s)]
*  they hate that we have whatever, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=957.1600000000001s)]
*  that we're Christian, whatever it is. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=959.72s)]
*  And- [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=961.6s)]
*  Or you have freedom of religion, they hate any of that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=962.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=965.0s)]
*  There was all these, it was like, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=965.84s)]
*  but the only way you could get that information [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=966.6600000000001s)]
*  was through the main network. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=968.2s)]
*  Yeah, you had to listen to Dick Cheney [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=970.16s)]
*  have a conversation with some news lady on CNN [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=972.02s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=975.38s)]
*  But what's interesting, I think, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=976.52s)]
*  for a lot of these young people, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=977.9s)]
*  is when you read Osama Bin Laden, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=979.38s)]
*  you realize that, and I don't think the conclusion [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=982.1s)]
*  should be that he was right, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=984.54s)]
*  obviously you're never right when you're killing civilians. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=985.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=988.9399999999999s)]
*  Note to Israel. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=990.02s)]
*  But he had legitimate grievances. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=991.5s)]
*  And a bunch of those grievances are things [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=994.9399999999999s)]
*  that they never wanted the American people [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=996.9399999999999s)]
*  to know about because then you might have [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=999.64s)]
*  a slightly different feeling about the war. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1000.96s)]
*  I think the same thing is true with the war in Ukraine too. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1003.12s)]
*  It's like why they never want you to hear [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1005.26s)]
*  what Putin's issue actually is, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1007.0s)]
*  why did he invade this country? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1008.64s)]
*  It's why they all flipped out [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1010.12s)]
*  when Tucker went and interviewed him. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1011.0s)]
*  Because you're like, oh shit, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1012.6s)]
*  you get to hear his perspective now. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1013.44s)]
*  And it's not that necessarily the correct position [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1015.24s)]
*  is to side with Putin, it's not. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1017.72s)]
*  Or to side with Osama, it's not. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1019.72s)]
*  But it's not wrong to recognize that like, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1021.32s)]
*  okay, he's got a point about this, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1025.92s)]
*  he's got a point about that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1028.5s)]
*  Osama, aside from being an Islamist, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1029.74s)]
*  which we all know he was. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1032.02s)]
*  And what does Islamist mean? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1033.54s)]
*  Well, meaning like a fundamentalist, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1034.66s)]
*  not just a Muslim, but like a believer [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1038.78s)]
*  in like the most fundamentalist doctrine of Islam. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1042.1s)]
*  So he was that, but then he's got all these grievances [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1045.78s)]
*  listed in his declaration of war against America [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1049.5s)]
*  and his open letter to America. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1052.1s)]
*  What were some of them? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1053.54s)]
*  Can we bring them up, you think? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1054.38s)]
*  Or is it too deep to go into? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1055.2s)]
*  No, no, I mean, it's not even that complicated. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1056.26s)]
*  I mean, the major ones were, the number one [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1059.16s)]
*  was that we have military bases [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1062.44s)]
*  in their holy land in Saudi Arabia. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1064.48s)]
*  They hate this. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1066.6s)]
*  They find this to be like a total, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1067.92s)]
*  and I'm no expert on Islam, but from their perspective, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1069.44s)]
*  this is blasphemy. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1072.62s)]
*  Oh, I can imagine that. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1073.92s)]
*  Say if I'm going to my church or my religious place, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1074.76s)]
*  my place of worship, and there's a guy sitting over there. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1076.92s)]
*  And a foreign military. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1080.44s)]
*  Right, foreign group, loudly drinking out of a juice box [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1081.64s)]
*  or something and pouring a loud candy in his hand [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1085.78s)]
*  because he doesn't give a fuck. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1090.26s)]
*  He doesn't even probably recognize [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1091.3799999999999s)]
*  that my religion even exists. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1092.66s)]
*  He may not, he may, he may not. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1093.82s)]
*  But still, that's going to make me fume. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1095.34s)]
*  Oh, dude, but also, I mean, look, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1098.18s)]
*  even if just you looked at it [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1100.14s)]
*  from a not religious point of view, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1101.54s)]
*  I mean, if there was Chinese or Russian military bases [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1103.32s)]
*  in our country and we knew that they're the real boss, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1106.84s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1111.22s)]
*  It's not, let's get real. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1112.06s)]
*  America is not on par with the Saudi government. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1113.36s)]
*  We're the world empire [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1116.76s)]
*  and they're our little satellite over there. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1118.0s)]
*  That would make people infuriated. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1120.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, people over here, liberals over here [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1123.0s)]
*  got infuriated about Trump being connected to Russia [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1126.52s)]
*  and that wasn't even true. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1129.1599999999999s)]
*  So imagine it was true. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1130.4399999999998s)]
*  And there were Russian bases all over the place. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1132.04s)]
*  People would lose their minds. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1134.52s)]
*  Yeah, who wouldn't stand for it? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1135.6s)]
*  That was a major, that was the major one. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1137.0s)]
*  But it's the military bases, it was us, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1139.3999999999999s)]
*  our support for Israel and what they do to the Palestinians. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1142.26s)]
*  And then- [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1145.54s)]
*  He mentioned that? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1146.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1147.2s)]
*  This was the major, major part of the beef. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1148.14s)]
*  Wow, I didn't know that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1150.06s)]
*  Yes, so they were furious about that [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1151.18s)]
*  because Israel is not too kind [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1153.74s)]
*  to their Palestinian neighbors. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1155.96s)]
*  And so that was a big part of it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1157.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's heartbreaking over there. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1160.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, and this has been the worst thing [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1161.42s)]
*  that Israel's ever done to the Palestinians [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1165.26s)]
*  over the last year plus, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1166.9s)]
*  but it's not like this is where it started. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1167.9s)]
*  It was going on since- [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1169.94s)]
*  We had some guys come on and talk about Israel and Palestine, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1171.88s)]
*  just like the histories of both of them. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1175.92s)]
*  It was cool, we had Rabbi Wolpe come on, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1178.04s)]
*  and we had Basim- [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1180.48s)]
*  Yusuf? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1183.32s)]
*  Yusuf, come on. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1184.16s)]
*  And just to give the two different sides [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1185.24s)]
*  and take us through the different perspectives of history. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1188.4s)]
*  But yeah, so this was the message right here [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  that Osama had written, right? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1193.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1196.68s)]
*  And so those were some of his big issues. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1197.52s)]
*  Yes, looks like it here, I can't- [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1199.16s)]
*  Okay, criticism of American military bases [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1201.66s)]
*  in the Middle East, condemnation of US support for Israel, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1203.5400000000002s)]
*  accusation of US exploitation of the region. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1205.98s)]
*  Number three, so there, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1208.7s)]
*  what he was specifically talking about- [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1210.92s)]
*  And let's just say it so we- [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1212.5s)]
*  So what it says here is, I'm not sure what we're reading, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1213.94s)]
*  but accusations of US exploitation [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1216.3400000000001s)]
*  of the region's natural resources. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1218.9s)]
*  And what he's talking about there is us insisting [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1220.3000000000002s)]
*  that they keep oil artificially low, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1223.02s)]
*  the price of oil artificially low, which is true. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1227.3s)]
*  I mean, even just when, I remember a couple years ago [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1230.1599999999999s)]
*  when inflation was at its worst, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1233.36s)]
*  the Biden administration just asked the Saudis [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1236.28s)]
*  to lower the price of oil because, you know, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1238.3799999999999s)]
*  then that'll make prices cheaper here, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1240.84s)]
*  help face less political pressure [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1243.1399999999999s)]
*  of people being mad about gas being so expensive. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  But when you really think about what the ask is there, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1246.9199999999998s)]
*  the ask is, hey, make your people poorer [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1250.08s)]
*  so that our people can be richer. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1254.2s)]
*  And so this was a big beef they had too, but- [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1256.54s)]
*  By lowering the value of it basically. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1259.26s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. By saying it's worth less. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1260.98s)]
*  By selling it for less. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1262.54s)]
*  We get cheaper energy, but your people get less money. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1263.78s)]
*  So that was one of their major beefs. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1267.34s)]
*  And then at the time, you gotta remember, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1268.98s)]
*  cause this was in the 90s, or actually I'm not sure, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1271.5s)]
*  the letter to America might've been later, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1274.04s)]
*  but his declaration of war against America was like in 96. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1276.98s)]
*  But so the big thing at the time [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1280.1s)]
*  was the Clinton's bombing campaign of Iraq [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1281.86s)]
*  and his blockade of Iraq. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1284.94s)]
*  So there's like, it's debated how many people died from it. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1286.48s)]
*  The UN estimated at one point that 500,000 children [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  had died from starvation and malnutrition. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1292.92s)]
*  So that was enough. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1295.52s)]
*  So it's like he had all these grievances [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1296.3600000000001s)]
*  and a lot of them involved the US either directly [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1298.44s)]
*  or indirectly killing Muslim kids. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1302.3s)]
*  And you know, I mean, look, obviously you're, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1306.16s)]
*  he's wrong for doing terrorism, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1309.3200000000002s)]
*  but I think most of us could admit that like, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1311.44s)]
*  yeah, if anyone, you know, if any of us, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1313.86s)]
*  like children that we care about were being slaughtered, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1317.06s)]
*  we might be ready to do some violent stuff [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1319.8999999999999s)]
*  on behalf of that too. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1322.02s)]
*  I mean- [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1323.22s)]
*  Well, depending on what perspective you look up, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1324.06s)]
*  Robin Hood is a tale of a terrorist. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  Depending on what perspective you look at it through. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1326.98s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, look, and that's, or you know- [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1328.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1331.82s)]
*  Does that make any sense to you a little bit? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1332.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well, I think the, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1333.48s)]
*  I think according to the British empire, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1334.78s)]
*  our founding fathers were a bunch of terrorists probably. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1336.34s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1338.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, well, when you go back to American history, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1339.5s)]
*  I mean, what we did to the Native Americans, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1340.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure they had huge beef amongst each other, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1342.52s)]
*  but they were also blatantly lied to [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1345.04s)]
*  and taken advantage of countless times [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1349.24s)]
*  by other people that had come in, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1351.48s)]
*  you know, by white settlers that had come in or, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1352.84s)]
*  and by the Spanish as well. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1355.52s)]
*  You know, a lot of times it all gets put onto honkies [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1357.56s)]
*  or whatever, but it was also darker honkies, the Spanish. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1360.68s)]
*  Yeah, just so you know, we don't even consider them white. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1363.96s)]
*  Okay, so it was really your beef is with each other. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1366.48s)]
*  But, so let's tie this back into the TikTok. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1369.82s)]
*  Okay, so you're saying that it's because, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1372.9799999999998s)]
*  and this, I believe that, yeah, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1376.2199999999998s)]
*  one of the main reasons TikTok has been banned is, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1377.9399999999998s)]
*  or is there's a threat of the ban or the force of the sale [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1380.1799999999998s)]
*  is because they don't want it to be in the hands [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1383.5s)]
*  of a place where they can't have [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1385.2199999999998s)]
*  the other side of the story come out, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1388.7199999999998s)]
*  whether it be about Palestine or about anything. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1390.6599999999999s)]
*  No, the cover story, the reason they claimed at first [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1393.8999999999999s)]
*  that they were trying to ban it was because of China, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1397.0s)]
*  but it really wasn't until the war broke out in Gaza [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1400.34s)]
*  that this pressure kind of started mounting. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1404.68s)]
*  But the China thing, I mean, I don't know. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1407.08s)]
*  You know, I remember like Tucker did a whole thing on this [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1409.84s)]
*  back when he still had the show on Fox News, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1412.2s)]
*  and he was showing the thing where like, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1414.28s)]
*  I don't know, have you ever seen like the way the algorithm [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1416.08s)]
*  on TikTok works in China [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1418.4s)]
*  compared to the way it works in America? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1419.92s)]
*  There's a more educational and fun. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1421.84s)]
*  The number one trending video for 17 year olds in China [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1423.52s)]
*  is like a kid playing the violin or something, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1426.34s)]
*  and then ours is just some chick twerking, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1428.46s)]
*  you know, like on a sports car or something like that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1430.3799999999999s)]
*  And then they were like kind of saying like, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1432.6599999999999s)]
*  oh, see, it's China's poisoning our kids' minds. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1434.26s)]
*  But I always thought, I mean, I don't know what the answer is, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1437.58s)]
*  but like, isn't it possible that our kids are just- [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1440.6599999999999s)]
*  Poisoning our own minds? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1443.3s)]
*  Yeah, like their algorithm is just showing them this garbage [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1444.1399999999999s)]
*  and their algorithm is showing them this. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1447.06s)]
*  Because like, if I just made a conscious effort [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1448.6599999999999s)]
*  to go on Twitter every day and only look up like [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1451.1599999999999s)]
*  violin lessons, I'm sure that's what the algorithm [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1454.04s)]
*  would start sending me after a while. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1456.72s)]
*  So I've always like been suspicious that it's like, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1458.52s)]
*  I think our culture is just messed up and that's- [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1461.34s)]
*  We're our worst enemy at a lot of the same time [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1463.52s)]
*  because it's like, we want certain things, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1465.8s)]
*  but we're not willing to let go of any comforts [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1468.24s)]
*  or really battle some of our addictive natures, you know? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1472.48s)]
*  I think some of that too is just a side effect of capitalism [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1476.6s)]
*  and a side effect of comfort over time [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1480.2s)]
*  and a side effect of kind of deterioration of our society. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1482.78s)]
*  Even if you look at, I was reading this the other day [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1486.86s)]
*  about pornography, a lot of the videos and pornography, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1489.3s)]
*  someone would be like, dad's daughter. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1493.54s)]
*  Dad's- Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1495.62s)]
*  When you really think about the fact that that's how they're, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1496.46s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1498.66s)]
*  It's like, somebody has a dark goal to tear down [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1499.5s)]
*  the little things, like family, things that matter. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1503.66s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1506.06s)]
*  So- [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1506.9s)]
*  You know, I was wondering, I remember asking a friend [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1507.9s)]
*  about this, like, this was a while ago, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1511.52s)]
*  but it was 10 years ago or something like that. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1513.56s)]
*  But it was like when I started noticing that, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1516.68s)]
*  I was like, what's up with all the porn categories [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1518.4s)]
*  of like family swap and this and that? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1520.6s)]
*  And a buddy of mine said this to me, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1523.44s)]
*  and I thought, oh man, that kind of makes sense. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1525.26s)]
*  But he was like, oh, you know what it is? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1527.44s)]
*  Is he goes, nowadays, like families are so broken up [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1528.84s)]
*  and mish-mashed and everyone's from divorces [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1532.4s)]
*  and everything, that so many people grew up [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1534.72s)]
*  with like a stepmom and step siblings. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1537.4s)]
*  So you'd just be a kid and then all of a sudden, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1541.1399999999999s)]
*  you got like these new girls who aren't your mother [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1543.58s)]
*  and sister, you know what I mean? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1548.02s)]
*  Like living in your house. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1549.34s)]
*  And so they're like, that's what led to that, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1550.82s)]
*  which I don't know if that theory is correct or not. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1552.58s)]
*  It sounds like that dude- [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1554.6999999999998s)]
*  But I thought that was kinda, I was like, yeah, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1555.54s)]
*  either he's a really sick person or you're onto something. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1556.9399999999998s)]
*  That guy sounds like he was building a, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  like he was literally using you to build a case [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1561.54s)]
*  for a future indictment he was gonna face. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1564.3s)]
*  But no, it's kinda- [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1567.58s)]
*  He came out with it really quickly too. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1568.4199999999998s)]
*  Like it was- [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1569.6599999999999s)]
*  He's like, we just signed this petition right here today. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1570.96s)]
*  I'm so glad you asked. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1573.96s)]
*  I've been dying to talk to someone about this. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1575.36s)]
*  But let me, I'm trying to tie this, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1578.52s)]
*  what were we talking about in my mind? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1579.56s)]
*  Just like- [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1580.4s)]
*  TikTok and then- [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1581.24s)]
*  But TikTok, yeah, like, yeah, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1582.5s)]
*  we're also part of our own, it's like, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1584.0s)]
*  we just keep creating this stuff, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1586.08s)]
*  but, or just ridiculousness, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1587.64s)]
*  and we get addicted to the ridiculousness, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1589.8s)]
*  but also some of that's part of the freedom [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1591.68s)]
*  of just being in a place where you can make [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1593.48s)]
*  whatever you want. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1595.04s)]
*  And you had that like freedom of creation, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1597.38s)]
*  kind of to an extent, or freedom of your own creativity, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1599.4s)]
*  some places you can't even really be creative in [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1602.6000000000001s)]
*  because it's not, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1605.44s)]
*  it's not not allowed, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1607.8000000000002s)]
*  but the expressions of certain creativities aren't. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1608.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't buy the Chinese, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1612.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I buy the Chinese thing or not, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1614.24s)]
*  because to me it's like, aren't all these apps, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1616.42s)]
*  like all of them seem like they're foreign to me. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1619.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and what difference does it make? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1623.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just, you know, I know people were giving me shit [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1626.24s)]
*  because I said something about this [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1629.82s)]
*  on Pierce Morgan's show the other day, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1631.2199999999998s)]
*  but you know, they were trying to make it out, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1633.06s)]
*  like it was, the topic was about how Mark Zuckerberg [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1635.2199999999998s)]
*  just announced that he's gonna let people talk [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1639.6599999999999s)]
*  on Facebook again or whatever. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1641.9399999999998s)]
*  And you know, someone was arguing with me that like, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1644.4599999999998s)]
*  well, the government, the US government has to like, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1648.1799999999998s)]
*  have these conversations with Facebook [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1650.76s)]
*  because all of these foreign governments [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1652.6999999999998s)]
*  are trying to propagandize us. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1654.4599999999998s)]
*  And I'm just like, I don't know, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1656.28s)]
*  after the last few years, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1659.36s)]
*  how are you gonna tell me that DC should get in charge [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1661.4s)]
*  because other people are trying to lie to us? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1665.52s)]
*  Like all of the most blatant, most consequential lies [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1667.66s)]
*  have come from my own government. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1671.04s)]
*  So like, I just don't get worked up over this, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1672.64s)]
*  like Iran is trying to propaganda. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1674.72s)]
*  I agree. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1677.24s)]
*  Okay, so like, tell me, when was the last time [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1678.08s)]
*  Iran had like an effective propaganda campaign [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1679.4s)]
*  that actually, you know, like led to something in America? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1682.32s)]
*  Okay, well, my own government had this country, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1686.46s)]

*  all you guys- For four years. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1697.14s)]
*  And literally told us that what, if true, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1698.22s)]
*  would have been the biggest story in the history [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1700.74s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1702.48s)]
*  Nothing true at all. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1703.32s)]
*  But imagine if it were true, like you were making the claim [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1704.54s)]
*  that the sitting president of the United States of America [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1707.64s)]
*  is involved in a conspiracy with a hostile foreign power. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1710.42s)]
*  It was all bullshit. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1713.42s)]
*  And all you guys still have your jobs. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1714.76s)]
*  All the people who sold that are still the ones [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1716.72s)]
*  complaining on the news today that no one trusts them [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1718.52s)]
*  without even thinking about that. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1720.8s)]
*  Yeah, and you could ask in a regular, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1722.4s)]
*  I'm a pretty regular guy, I think, you know, like, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1723.96s)]
*  and I don't mean that in like a braggy way, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1726.64s)]
*  I just feel like I try to, you know, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1728.16s)]
*  I try to be smarter sometimes, it's hard for me. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1730.34s)]
*  I didn't, I realized I just have to try my best [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1732.76s)]
*  at where I'm at. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1734.72s)]
*  And I thought immediately Russia, I was like, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1735.8s)]
*  they're running out of steam, they have an old dude. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1739.32s)]
*  A lot of people go over there for perverted stuff, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1742.12s)]
*  you know, it's like, I could certainly see [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1744.76s)]
*  a lot of our leaders passing through there. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  And you know what I'm saying, we'll do a few favors [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1749.04s)]
*  for Russia because they don't want some videos [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1751.2199999999998s)]
*  getting released. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1753.32s)]
*  But I don't think that this, you know, this, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1754.1599999999999s)]
*  they don't seem like they're on the cusp of, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1756.98s)]
*  of like holding us at bay for something, you know? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1762.08s)]
*  I just, immediately they didn't pass the smell test to me. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1766.28s)]
*  Well, also just that it's Donald Trump. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, like say whatever you want about Donald Trump, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1771.06s)]
*  he was a known commodity. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1773.62s)]
*  He's like the most American thing. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1775.26s)]
*  He's the most famous rich guy of all time. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1777.74s)]
*  Like you're telling me he was a Russian spy? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1780.52s)]
*  It just made no sense. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1783.26s)]
*  And then they had nothing. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1785.3s)]
*  They had no evidence to support it at all. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1786.82s)]
*  Never, except they just beat you into it over and over again [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1788.3799999999999s)]

*  MoonPay is the way. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1882.62s)]
*  You're a startup founder. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1884.62s)]

*  You've founded a startup [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1887.6000000000001s)]
*  and now you've gotta find product market fit. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1889.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1893.3200000000002s)]
*  That's probably your number one priority. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1894.16s)]
*  Now maybe you have a new software. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1896.2800000000002s)]
*  You have a new type of drone [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1898.0800000000002s)]
*  that takes family photos from outer space. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1901.5600000000002s)]
*  Or maybe you developed a new shoe [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1905.52s)]
*  and it purifies water and sorts coins while you walk. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1907.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1911.92s)]
*  But finding product market fit [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1913.0400000000002s)]
*  is probably your number one priority. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1915.1s)]
*  But to land bigger customers, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1917.84s)]
*  you also need security compliance. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1919.2199999999998s)]
*  That's where Vanta comes in. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1922.04s)]

*  And the thing, and that's where I think, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1964.78s)]
*  that's really where I think the media started to go, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1967.1s)]
*  really lose its grip on people [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1969.1799999999998s)]
*  and on control. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1973.24s)]
*  And so that's why I really worry a lot. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1974.2s)]
*  With this TikTok ban, I'm like, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1976.16s)]
*  because if news is getting out there [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1978.36s)]
*  about all types of things, it could be like, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1981.36s)]
*  there was also a lot of Barbara O'Neill. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1983.48s)]
*  Did you see those clips on her? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1987.0s)]
*  She's a medicine woman, an Australian medicine woman. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1987.92s)]
*  But there was a lot of natural remedy stuff [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1991.16s)]
*  that started to just be put out there. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1993.6s)]
*  I don't know if it was valid or not, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1996.28s)]
*  but it was like you would see a ton of it. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=1998.36s)]
*  So basically opposition to all these medicines, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2001.22s)]
*  all these prescriptions you need. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2004.8200000000002s)]
*  So I could see certainly how no but the powers that be, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2007.28s)]
*  if they exist, don't want a lot of this type [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2012.2s)]
*  of information out there. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2015.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, of course. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2016.22s)]
*  And especially with Palestine. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2017.06s)]
*  I don't think, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2018.18s)]
*  I don't understand what's going on over there. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2023.02s)]
*  I mean, that Netanyahu guy. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2026.3s)]
*  I mean, what he's doing to these people is like, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2028.68s)]
*  it's the most inexcusable, just horrific thing in the world. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2032.68s)]
*  And the fact that, you know, like I said this [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2036.5600000000002s)]
*  on Rogan's podcast and I got shit for it, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2038.72s)]
*  but I stand by this. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2041.7600000000002s)]
*  But it's just like, you know, it's just like [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2042.8600000000001s)]
*  throughout all the history, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2044.8000000000002s)]
*  there's just all this horrible shit. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2045.98s)]
*  It's just slavery and wars and genocides [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2047.5200000000002s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing campaigns and all this. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2050.2000000000003s)]
*  And every single point in history, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2052.08s)]
*  there was someone there who would justify it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2053.76s)]
*  And be like, no, we have to. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2055.8s)]
*  We have reasons why it's okay to do this. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2057.7400000000002s)]
*  And they bend over backward and twist themselves [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2059.62s)]
*  into pretzels to explain why they're the real victims. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2062.1s)]
*  And they really have to do this to these people. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2064.6600000000003s)]
*  Cause if they don't, then they do it to them. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2066.54s)]
*  But it's all indefensible. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2069.06s)]
*  You're like, you just defend an evil shit. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2070.2200000000003s)]
*  And I feel the same way about Israel, man. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2072.04s)]
*  It's just to defend what they're doing to a group of people [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2074.02s)]
*  who are captive, who they've been occupying since 1967. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2077.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, you've been occupying. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2082.26s)]
*  They don't have a military. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2084.1400000000003s)]
*  They don't have a government. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2085.48s)]
*  They don't have an air force. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2087.64s)]
*  They have no means of defending themselves. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2088.48s)]
*  And you're just destroying the place. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2090.6s)]
*  But you're not letting the news out. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2092.8799999999997s)]
*  That's the thing, right? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2094.52s)]
*  You're not letting people get a fair take of [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2095.56s)]
*  what could potentially be going on there, right? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2098.3999999999996s)]
*  You're not letting it, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2101.12s)]
*  you're doing everything you can to stop that. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2102.5s)]
*  Well, they always do. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2104.64s)]
*  The only thing that's different is that now [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2106.3599999999997s)]
*  it's actually a challenge for them to do that. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2109.16s)]
*  So throughout, but every war relies on lies [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2111.48s)]
*  and every war relies on totally dehumanizing the enemy. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2114.2599999999998s)]
*  Because if you can't do that, you're in a lot of trouble. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2117.54s)]
*  You know, if you leave just a little inch of humanity [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2120.18s)]
*  for those people, then immediately you're gonna go, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2123.14s)]
*  oh my God, what are we doing? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2125.62s)]
*  Because if that was your brother's kid [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2127.4199999999996s)]
*  or your nephew, your son, you'd lose your mind [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2129.9399999999996s)]
*  about someone doing that to them. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2133.22s)]
*  Oh, well, I think it's like, I'm not an anti-Israel guy. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2134.4199999999996s)]
*  I am a, but that guy seems, it just seems, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2137.8999999999996s)]
*  he gives me this vibe that it's evil, right? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2142.2s)]
*  And it's not something I'm making in my head. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2145.6s)]
*  It's something that starts inside of me. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2148.3599999999997s)]
*  It's not like I'm, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2150.68s)]
*  because I know it because I knew it when I went to Cuba [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2152.12s)]
*  when I was in college and I would see people [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2155.7999999999997s)]
*  that would come up to the windows [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  and they weren't allowed to share what they, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2158.8799999999997s)]
*  they had to whisper if they wanted to tell you something, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2162.0s)]
*  right? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2164.52s)]
*  Or when we went to the libraries there [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2165.3599999999997s)]
*  and they only had books that started at Fidel. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2166.74s)]
*  Their history books started at fucking Fidel. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2170.36s)]
*  So if you're a kid and you wanted to, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2172.98s)]
*  you couldn't, you didn't exist. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2174.46s)]
*  Your grandparents didn't even, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2176.1400000000003s)]
*  whoever, your essence didn't exist, you know? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2178.02s)]
*  So, and they had, I read a quote somewhere that, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2180.42s)]
*  the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2183.9s)]
*  that his father said that, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2186.7400000000002s)]
*  oh, he didn't like Arabs, right? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2189.2000000000003s)]
*  And he didn't like the essence of Arabs. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2191.06s)]
*  And that to me was just like a thing. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2194.1800000000003s)]
*  Like, that's the same type of shit. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2196.1800000000003s)]
*  It would seem like that Hitler would have said, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2198.46s)]
*  I don't like whatever the, the, the granule, the grain, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2200.48s)]
*  I don't like the, the atom of this person. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2206.52s)]
*  I don't know, man, maybe, and I don't know. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2209.32s)]
*  No, it's, listen, I mean, it's, there's, you know, my- [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2211.4s)]
*  It just makes me, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2214.44s)]
*  and the biggest thing, it just breaks my heart. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2215.28s)]
*  And so I know when that kind of shit's happening [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2216.88s)]
*  where my feel, it's like, that's where it comes from. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2218.64s)]
*  It's like, you know, it just like, I don't know. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2221.7200000000003s)]
*  I've always had a barometer for like the underdog, I think. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2225.88s)]
*  You know, and maybe that's all, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2229.3s)]
*  maybe some of it's that too, you know? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2230.58s)]
*  I don't know everything. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2232.5s)]
*  I don't know a ton of history, you know? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2233.38s)]
*  But, but yeah, some of that shit, it just fucking hurts. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2234.58s)]
*  When you think about how many children have been, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2237.78s)]
*  how many kids have been killed over there? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2239.46s)]
*  Estimation. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2241.5s)]
*  I mean, the estimates I think are, have been so far, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2242.9s)]
*  they're like undercounted. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2246.34s)]
*  I think a lot more people than we initially thought are dying. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2248.54s)]
*  But it was, I think I saw it, the estimation, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2252.4s)]
*  I think the estimate was that two thirds of the dead [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2254.96s)]
*  were women and children. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2257.56s)]
*  So I don't know what, you know, exactly the breakup [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2259.04s)]
*  between the women and children is. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2261.88s)]
*  And I don't know if there are good numbers on that. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2263.32s)]
*  But Gaza is 50% children. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2265.28s)]
*  Like that's one of the major things [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2268.08s)]
*  that makes it such a humanitarian thing there. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2269.3s)]
*  Yeah, because it sounds like such a fun place to kids. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2271.16s)]
*  Gaza, if you tell the kid like, where are we gonna go? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2272.36s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2274.8s)]
*  If you're like, we're gonna go to Yemen or Gaza, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2276.56s)]
*  they're gonna go there. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2279.4s)]
*  One of the parks at Disney World. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2280.32s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't mean that. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2281.7200000000003s)]
*  Epcot, Gaza. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2282.56s)]
*  Dude, back here. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2283.74s)]
*  Conservative figures show that more than 6,000 women [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  and 11,000 children were killed in Gaza [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2288.18s)]
*  by the Israeli military over the last 12 months. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2289.98s)]
*  I mean, this is way, way undercounted. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2292.02s)]
*  It seems like it to me, yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2294.8599999999997s)]
*  For today, like as of right now, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2296.18s)]
*  I think the estimates are much higher. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2298.04s)]
*  Dude, here's the toughest part. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2299.58s)]
*  A lot of my Jewish friends are heartbroken by this, man. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2300.72s)]
*  And they'll come to me and we'll be talking about it, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2303.4599999999996s)]
*  because, and they're just like, it's just sick [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2306.2999999999997s)]
*  that this is the guy who's representing us, you know? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2309.9399999999996s)]
*  And that this is the choice. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2313.72s)]
*  I don't understand why, but I guess if you live in Israel, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2314.56s)]
*  then you feel like, well, these people are gonna kill us. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2317.3599999999997s)]
*  And so you have no choice but to support your governor. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2320.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if you have no choice, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2325.6s)]
*  but there's definitely, like there's this human impulse, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2327.3199999999997s)]
*  and this is always what's going on [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2332.2s)]
*  with all these wars on both sides, right? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2334.48s)]
*  Are we gonna get in trouble for talking about this, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2336.4399999999996s)]
*  do you think? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2337.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2338.24s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2339.06s)]
*  But yeah, maybe. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2340.3999999999996s)]
*  I can't really get in any more trouble [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2341.96s)]
*  for talking about this. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2343.7s)]
*  Have you been in a lot of trouble? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2344.54s)]
*  Well, I've been talking about it so much for the last year, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2345.36s)]
*  and I don't know what trouble even means anymore. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2347.86s)]
*  I mean, I'm fine. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2350.26s)]
*  So like some people seem mad at me on the internet, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2351.26s)]
*  but I don't care. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2353.82s)]
*  And so it's, it seems okay. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2355.06s)]
*  But you know, of course, like I could totally imagine [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2359.66s)]
*  that if you were, like let's say one of your family members [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2363.14s)]
*  was killed by Hamas militants on October 7th, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2366.56s)]
*  I could understand where you'd have the attitude. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2369.44s)]
*  You'd be like, man, let's go fucking fuck this place up. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2371.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah, turn into old William Wallace. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2374.2s)]
*  Sure, but that also is the same thing [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2375.8799999999997s)]
*  that's going on with the Palestinians, right? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2378.52s)]
*  And so a whole bunch of them, in fact, a lot more of them [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2380.9199999999996s)]
*  have seen their family members killed and stuff, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2384.04s)]
*  and so they're ready to go, you know, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2386.22s)]
*  like slaughter as many people as they can. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2387.9199999999996s)]
*  In the same sense that like right after 9-11, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2389.7599999999998s)]
*  Americans were like, hey, let's go. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2392.12s)]
*  Let's go blow some shit up. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2394.9599999999996s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, you tell us who did this [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2395.8799999999997s)]
*  and let's go blow them up. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2397.48s)]
*  And then like even if it's not exactly the people [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2398.48s)]
*  who did it, you know, okay. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2400.26s)]
*  I mean, when we fought the war in Afghanistan, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2402.2000000000003s)]
*  even forget Iraq, that just had nothing to do with it, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2404.1200000000003s)]
*  but in Afghanistan, it's like, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2406.2400000000002s)]
*  it wasn't Afghans who attacked us. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2408.6800000000003s)]
*  It was some Arabs who were Saudi Arabians. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2410.6000000000004s)]
*  Right, it was Saudis and Egyptians, right, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2413.5600000000004s)]
*  who were hanging out in Afghanistan, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2416.0s)]
*  and then with the special ops missions, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2419.1600000000003s)]
*  we drove them all out and destroyed all their bases, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2421.7000000000003s)]
*  and then it was like, okay, we got this Taliban here. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2424.1600000000003s)]
*  Now, they're not exactly guilty of it, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2426.8s)]
*  but well, something's gotta be blown up, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2428.46s)]
*  and so we're gonna go fight those guys. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2430.2200000000003s)]
*  So, but then the thing is that, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2432.38s)]
*  if you, the thing with Osama Bin Laden's letter [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2435.1s)]
*  is that you're like, oh, but that's kind of [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2437.1s)]
*  their motivation too. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2438.54s)]
*  Like they're also a bunch of people going, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2439.94s)]
*  hey, we just saw a bunch of our people get killed. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2441.9s)]
*  We're gonna come fuck some of you guys up. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2444.58s)]
*  And so that's kind of the attitude everybody has. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2447.1s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's the crazy thing. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2449.34s)]
*  It's like you use, and the toughest part is [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2450.58s)]
*  the people are the ones who have to go and shed the blood. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2453.38s)]
*  The people are the ones who have to have the blood shed [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2456.94s)]
*  based on what their leaders, who they elect, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2459.84s)]
*  and they would never elect them and tell them to do that, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2462.64s)]
*  then choose to do, that's what, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2465.04s)]
*  I'm just like, how does this, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2466.8s)]
*  but then that's how things, that's just being alive, I guess, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2468.7200000000003s)]
*  and in human sometimes, as sad as that is, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2471.8s)]
*  or that's just how humanity's gone for a long time, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2475.26s)]
*  and society is gone, and war is gone. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2477.2400000000002s)]
*  But yeah, you have to think, how many Iraq, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2479.52s)]
*  Iraqi people who had nothing to do with 9-11, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2481.58s)]
*  if they had nothing to do with it, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2485.54s)]
*  were affected by our military presence over there, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2488.18s)]
*  and are just waiting in the wings [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2491.62s)]
*  to affect harm on New America. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2494.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is why we had to deal with [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2496.34s)]
*  that insurgency over there that took us so many years [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2498.46s)]
*  to ultimately lose to. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2501.14s)]
*  There's people, people don't like when you invade [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2504.46s)]
*  their country and destroy their homes [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2507.34s)]
*  and kill their relatives and stuff like that. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2509.9s)]
*  And yeah, imagine, if you think about that, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2511.82s)]
*  nobody in Iraq had anything to do with 9-11. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2514.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, there were some al-Qaeda members [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2517.88s)]
*  who came into Iraq to fight as part of the insurgency [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2519.44s)]
*  after we invaded, but when we invaded, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2522.7200000000003s)]
*  there was no one in Iraq who had anything to do with 9-11. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2525.08s)]
*  And- [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2527.92s)]
*  They must have been like, what the fuck? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2528.92s)]
*  Well, imagine, particularly if you're like, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2530.28s)]
*  Saddam Hussein was their problem, not ours. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2532.88s)]
*  Like, Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2536.4s)]
*  but he wasn't our brutal dictator, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2538.28s)]
*  they were the ones who had to live under Saddam Hussein. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2540.32s)]
*  So now they're living under this brutal dictator, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2542.86s)]
*  and then they got the most powerful military [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2544.7400000000002s)]
*  in the history of the world invading [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2546.5800000000004s)]
*  and just wrecking the country, all because, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2548.54s)]
*  well, we can get into that, but largely because [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2551.98s)]
*  Netanyahu wanted us to do it. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2554.9s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2557.2200000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu's a huge, huge part of the war in Iraq. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2558.0600000000004s)]
*  Why do we keep supporting him? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2561.0600000000004s)]
*  There's an interesting dynamic, I mean, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2564.5800000000004s)]
*  there's a lot of things going on. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2566.94s)]
*  So part of it is that there's, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2568.82s)]
*  well, there were the neoconservatives [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2573.0800000000004s)]
*  who were really big in the George W. Bush years, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2575.0s)]
*  and they were, all of them fanatically pro-Israel. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2578.1600000000003s)]
*  There is APEC, and there's the ADL, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2584.32s)]
*  and the Southern Poverty Law Center, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2587.96s)]
*  and there are these organizations in the country that will, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2589.36s)]
*  it is their business to ruin your life [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2592.88s)]
*  if you're against Israel, particularly if you're in politics [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2595.48s)]
*  and you're against Israel. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2598.36s)]
*  I mean, they just poured insane amounts of money. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2599.6600000000003s)]
*  They lost, but they tried to get Thomas Massie primaried [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2602.92s)]
*  out of his Congress seat. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2606.38s)]
*  He's the guy that doesn't want to have a APEC guy, right? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2608.1s)]
*  Yeah, he's the only one who doesn't, according to him, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2610.36s)]
*  the only one who doesn't have an APEC guy, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2612.84s)]
*  so they do not like him. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2614.42s)]
*  But do, is there's? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2615.76s)]
*  The other, there's lots of other factors involved in this. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2617.08s)]
*  There's also things like, there's blackmail operations, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2620.2400000000002s)]
*  there's like Epstein, stuff like that, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2624.96s)]
*  and then there's also evangelical Christians in this country [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2627.32s)]
*  fanatically support Israel as well. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2631.32s)]
*  So there's like a whole bunch of forces that Israel has, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2633.36s)]
*  let's say, a very outsized influence on US policy. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2636.6800000000003s)]
*  Is there something that, I guess, yeah, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2641.34s)]
*  I guess I don't understand why we would support it [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2643.0s)]
*  while they're doing that murdering. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2644.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, and then even if you- [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2647.36s)]
*  Unless there's something I don't understand, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2649.44s)]
*  like that's also the thing, it's like, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2650.92s)]
*  are they just our best friend from a long time, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2654.44s)]
*  and that's just what it is? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2657.6s)]
*  And so it's like, I'm worried that I just also [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2658.44s)]
*  don't understand the history of much as why, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2661.56s)]
*  why there is so much support there. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2669.52s)]
*  Well, it's been- [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2672.2400000000002s)]
*  But you have to have a support in the Middle East, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2673.08s)]
*  you have to have a friend in there. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, that's been, that was the thinking for a long time. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2677.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2679.84s)]
*  And that if we had, there was a big concern [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2680.68s)]
*  for a lot of people in the American security apparatus [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2685.8399999999997s)]
*  back in the day that the Soviet Union [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2688.8799999999997s)]
*  was gonna take control of the Middle East, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  and if they really controlled that oil supply, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2692.8399999999997s)]
*  then they would be too strong [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2695.48s)]
*  and we'd have a real problem on our hands. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2697.2s)]
*  This is why Jimmy Carter, who just died, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2699.16s)]
*  he in 1980 declared what's known as the Carter Doctrine, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2702.56s)]
*  where he was like, listen, we are treating the Persian Gulf [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  like it's America, if, essentially saying to the USSR, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2709.9199999999996s)]
*  they had already invaded Afghanistan, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2713.3999999999996s)]
*  and it was like, if you invade Iran, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2715.4s)]
*  we are going to fight, we're gonna fight [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2717.24s)]
*  with the US military, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2719.92s)]
*  because we won't let you have all of this. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2720.92s)]
*  So that's always been a concern, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2722.64s)]
*  and I do think that Israel being kind of like our buddy there [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2724.44s)]
*  felt like, okay, this will be a good way [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2728.36s)]
*  that we can control the region. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2730.08s)]
*  But then, you know, this is, yeah, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2732.16s)]
*  this was at his State of the Union in early 1980. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2735.36s)]
*  Yeah, the Carter Doctrine was a policy proclaimed [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2738.08s)]
*  by President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2740.04s)]
*  and his State of the Union address on January 23rd, 1980, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2741.72s)]
*  which stated the United States would use military force [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2745.24s)]
*  if necessary to defend its national interests [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2746.52s)]
*  in the Persian Gulf. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2749.0s)]
*  So there's a ton of business interests over there, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2749.96s)]
*  and there's a ton of like peacekeeping, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2752.4s)]
*  or what we believe is peacekeeping over there. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2755.68s)]
*  By the way, this is just, it's interesting here, right? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2757.48s)]
*  So this is, he's saying this in January of 1980. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2760.2s)]
*  It was in 1979 was when the Ayatollahs [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2764.48s)]
*  had the revolution in Iran. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2767.56s)]
*  So this is, the government that's in Iran today, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2769.4s)]
*  our mortal enemy, they had just come into power. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2771.52s)]
*  So what Jimmy Carter's talking about doing here [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2775.4s)]
*  is defending Iran against the Soviet Union. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2777.0s)]
*  Like this country now that is the one [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2781.04s)]
*  that they all want war with. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2782.56s)]
*  Back then he was like, but if, you know what I mean, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2784.0s)]
*  if Gorbachev, or whoever was Gorbachev in there yet, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2787.04s)]
*  by 80, yeah, I think so, they'd be like, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2789.48s)]
*  if he goes and moves on Iran, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2792.28s)]
*  then we're gonna come to the defense militarily of Iran, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2794.64s)]
*  which is just kind of weird to think about now. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2797.92s)]
*  So this was saying that if the Soviets intervene, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2800.96s)]
*  then we're gonna come and defend Iran. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2804.56s)]
*  Yeah, and they had just, well, they had just, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2806.08s)]
*  they had just lured them into the war in Afghanistan, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2808.92s)]
*  which was also their plan. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2813.16s)]
*  And this guy, Zbigniew Brzezinski, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2814.6800000000003s)]
*  who you see down there, he's the national security advisor. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2817.6800000000003s)]
*  He had been the one who really pushed this policy [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2820.44s)]
*  of luring the Soviets into Afghanistan [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2823.12s)]
*  to give them their own, Vietnam was the idea. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2826.0s)]
*  And a lot of people credit that as one of the major factors [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2829.16s)]
*  that brought the Soviet Union down. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2832.2s)]
*  And so that, so we had lured them into a war in Afghanistan, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2834.92s)]
*  but then they got real concerned that like, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2838.3599999999997s)]
*  while they're here, they might also just go take Iran. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2839.96s)]
*  So we better send them a message, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2843.16s)]
*  like if you do that, you're gonna have problems. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2844.68s)]
*  So that was the idea was to keep them out of there. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2847.4s)]
*  It just shows you how much we've had, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2849.2s)]
*  like once you become this thing, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2850.44s)]
*  that's this entity that's trying to control everything, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2852.48s)]
*  how many, it's hard to keep, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2855.52s)]
*  they say like it's hard to keep track of the lies [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2859.52s)]
*  or whatever, that's not really it, but it's hard to, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2861.28s)]
*  it just seems like hard to manage. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2864.88s)]
*  It's hard to be an air traffic controller for the world, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2866.52s)]
*  especially when the planes have different religions [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2871.96s)]
*  and ideas and histories and beliefs and hopes. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2875.0s)]
*  You know, hopes, you know, it's, that's. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2880.48s)]
*  Oh, it's insane. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2884.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, the job, yeah, I mean, imagine, it's just impossible. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2885.4s)]
*  It's impossible, so that's what I'm saying. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2888.44s)]
*  It seems impossible. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2889.72s)]
*  And especially at a time when our own country [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2891.0s)]
*  is struggling so much and I don't know, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2892.48s)]
*  I hope, yeah, I don't mean to be like mean to Israel. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2894.4s)]
*  I just don't understand, you know, I love my Jewish friends. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2897.16s)]
*  I don't understand that shit though. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2899.56s)]
*  I don't understand why they're doing that over there. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2900.8399999999997s)]
*  Why they're doing that over there. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2906.6800000000003s)]
*  And then I think it falls in the power of this, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2907.92s)]
*  the wealthier person to figure it out, you know? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2911.56s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2913.92s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2914.76s)]
*  And it's that if you're coming from, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2915.6000000000004s)]
*  if you're in a situation where you're, look, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2917.36s)]
*  when it comes to Israel and Palestine, it's not, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2920.1200000000003s)]
*  there's no parity between the two of them. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2922.8s)]
*  It's not like, oh, these are two nation states [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2924.88s)]
*  around the same strength. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2927.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, Palestine isn't a nation state. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2929.4s)]
*  They don't have a government. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2931.48s)]
*  There's a halfway house of Arabs. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2932.32s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2935.24s)]
*  And so there's, when Israel has all the power, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2936.16s)]
*  all the leverage, all the chips, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2940.12s)]
*  and if you're in a situation where everybody's saying, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2942.2s)]
*  hey, you guys have been like at war for so long [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2944.64s)]
*  and we want peace, well, who's supposed to make [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2947.0s)]
*  the first concession when one side has all the chips? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2949.52s)]
*  That's a thing. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2952.7999999999997s)]
*  Obviously you need that side. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2953.64s)]
*  Don't push me, don't push another bullying video at me [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2954.6s)]
*  unless that's gonna be the first one [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2957.72s)]
*  that you fucking cite. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2959.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2961.4399999999996s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2962.2799999999997s)]
*  Shit, I don't understand sometimes. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2963.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2966.58s)]
*  I don't understand how we would have media [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2967.42s)]
*  that would be like, so anti-bullying [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2968.66s)]
*  and then this fucking bullying is going on. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2971.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's like, well, what kind of, who's believing you? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2974.1s)]
*  You know, or what are we doing? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2976.98s)]
*  I don't know, and also I don't fucking know, dude. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2978.58s)]
*  And I'm like nine days off on nicotine, so. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2980.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, are you really? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2983.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2984.18s)]
*  You gave up nicotine. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2985.0s)]
*  Yeah. Good for you, dude. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2985.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I guess, were you like smoking or vaping [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2986.74s)]
*  or just doing the pouches? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2989.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I would do, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2990.54s)]
*  I was smoked, I was vaping. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2992.6s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2995.68s)]
*  I was vaping, it's sad to say it as an adult too, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2996.52s)]
*  like slipping off just slurping on something. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=2998.3199999999997s)]
*  I know, I vape all the time, I'm totally embarrassed by it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3000.2799999999997s)]
*  I wish I was a man and I just smoked, but I don't know. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3003.12s)]
*  But. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3006.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but if you go on your porch now and light a pipe, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3007.24s)]
*  somebody will shoot you with a fucking musket. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3008.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and no one will feel bad for you. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3010.6s)]
*  Everyone will side with that guy. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3012.2s)]
*  Yeah. It'll be like, oh. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3013.3599999999997s)]
*  They'll be like, free the slaves, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3014.2799999999997s)]
*  and they'll just fucking pull right up [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3015.7599999999998s)]
*  and fucking pop one in you. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3017.04s)]
*  But so do you believe that the TikTok ban, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3018.72s)]
*  what do you really believe? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3022.44s)]
*  Or do you think we're still figuring it out? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3023.28s)]
*  Do you think that our elected officials [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3024.6s)]
*  will let it stay around? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3026.92s)]
*  Trump seems like he's wishy washy on it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3028.92s)]
*  He does, yes. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3030.64s)]
*  He seems like he's not exactly clear what, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3031.72s)]
*  and it's weird because the talk was, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3034.2400000000002s)]
*  initially the talk was like that it was a China thing, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3036.96s)]
*  and Trump always tried to be the most hawkish on China. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3039.88s)]
*  But even he does seem like he's not, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3043.44s)]
*  doesn't really seem like he's got strong convictions [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3045.48s)]
*  about getting rid of it. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3047.8s)]
*  My guess is that TikTok survives. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3048.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know if I'm right or wrong about that. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3050.96s)]
*  Frank McCourt and someone else [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3052.84s)]
*  is gonna be buying TikTok, they said. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3054.48s)]
*  So I think the thing is that if they sell, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3056.52s)]
*  then they escape the legislation [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3058.5600000000004s)]
*  because basically it was saying it's because it's owned, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3060.96s)]
*  their parent company is owned by the CCP or whatever. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3062.88s)]
*  So I have a feeling, I think that there's been, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3065.5600000000004s)]
*  there was a real move to really censor the internet [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3069.6800000000003s)]
*  over the last few years. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3073.2000000000003s)]
*  It seems to me like it's failed [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3074.4s)]
*  and that they've accepted [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3076.56s)]
*  they're not gonna be able to do it. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3078.88s)]
*  As the deadline for a potential TikTok ban in the US [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3080.52s)]
*  approaches billionaire and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3082.7599999999998s)]
*  oh hell yeah, Frank McCourt's Project Liberty confirmed [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3085.4s)]
*  making a formal offer to ByteDance, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3088.88s)]
*  a platform's Chinese parent company [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3090.6s)]
*  to buy the social media giant's American assets. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3091.92s)]
*  And he was gonna do it in conjunction [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3094.7599999999998s)]
*  with one of the guys from, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3097.04s)]
*  Sharks, good evening, Sharks, whatever that show is, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3101.7599999999998s)]
*  Shark Dance or whatever. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3104.48s)]
*  Shark boy, no, there's a woman. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3106.56s)]
*  Shark Tank? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3108.6s)]
*  Shark Tank. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3109.44s)]
*  There you go. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3110.2599999999998s)]
*  Shark Tank. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3111.1s)]
*  Who was it, Danny or something from Shark Tank? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3112.0s)]
*  Oh, one of them billionaires was gonna throw in. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3114.0s)]
*  Kevin O'Leary. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3117.88s)]
*  So him and Kevin O'Leary, I believe, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3119.2s)]
*  I believe, don't quote me on that, was supposed to be. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3122.56s)]
*  The videos are short on TikTok, right? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3126.12s)]
*  Isn't that the idea? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3128.4s)]
*  Some of them now can be longer. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3129.72s)]
*  Some of them can be, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3131.7599999999998s)]
*  I think 90 seconds is the length on Instagram. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3133.64s)]
*  TikTok can be a couple minutes now. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3137.08s)]
*  Here's a weird thing how the internet has kind of like [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3138.72s)]
*  very organically grown into almost, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3141.3599999999997s)]
*  it's almost like long form or seven seconds. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3144.16s)]
*  Like there's no like middle ground anymore. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3148.56s)]
*  It's always like, okay, we wanna hear a four hour [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3151.04s)]
*  conversation or give me six seconds of whatever you got [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3153.08s)]
*  and then we'll do a hundred thousand of those. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3156.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it is kind of true. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3158.92s)]
*  TikTok videos can range from three seconds [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3161.56s)]
*  to 60 minutes long depending on how you film [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3163.2799999999997s)]
*  or upload the video. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3166.48s)]
*  But this also could have been from chat GBT. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3167.92s)]
*  I don't know where or from AI this fact. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3169.7599999999998s)]
*  And so who knows if they're harboring that [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3172.0s)]
*  from years ago and today. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3174.16s)]
*  Videos or images and TikTok stories can go up to 15 seconds [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3175.7599999999998s)]
*  long with a disappear after 24 hours, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3178.7599999999998s)]
*  if you put it in the story. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3180.84s)]
*  So the way I look at it is kind of like, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3181.92s)]
*  it's like if you had like, say like a buddy of yours [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3184.24s)]
*  or something was in like just an awful relationship, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3186.56s)]
*  you know, like just like the chick he's with [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3189.2799999999997s)]
*  is like the worst, oh, it's like you hate her [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3190.76s)]
*  and she's shitty to him and she treats, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3192.84s)]
*  she's so mean to him, she cheats on him. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3194.5600000000004s)]
*  She's just the worst. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3196.28s)]
*  And then like if he breaks up with her [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3197.2000000000003s)]
*  and he's like, I'm just dating, I'm dating a bunch. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3199.32s)]
*  And you're like, great, thank God. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3201.88s)]
*  You're like back out there, go find someone else. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3203.8s)]
*  That chick was a nightmare, you know? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3205.8s)]
*  And they'd be like, well, I'm meeting some nice girls, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3207.0400000000004s)]
*  but I'm meeting some real awful girls too. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3209.32s)]
*  It's like, ah, okay, well, whatever, just get out there. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3210.88s)]
*  And that's kind of how I feel about like, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3213.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm just happy that the young generation [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3214.92s)]
*  isn't consuming the corporate media. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3217.0s)]
*  And like, I'm sure on TikTok, they get some bad stuff [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3219.2s)]
*  and then they get some good stuff, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3221.68s)]
*  but at least you're out there like shopping around [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3223.0s)]
*  and you're not just listening to like CNN tell you [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3225.24s)]
*  that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3228.52s)]
*  and we need to go fight this war with them [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3230.6s)]
*  or just listening to MSNBC tell you [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3232.3999999999996s)]
*  that Trump's a Russian spy or whatever. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3234.72s)]
*  It's like, all right, yeah, get out there, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3236.7599999999998s)]
*  mingle a little bit, see what kind of crazy persons [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3238.3999999999996s)]
*  on TikTok, I don't know. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3240.6s)]
*  One of them might be like, oh, it's, you know, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3242.3199999999997s)]
*  one of them's like, it's the Jews. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3244.48s)]
*  And then someone else is like, you know, whatever. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3246.0s)]
*  Like a gaze or whatever. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3248.0s)]
*  Okay, maybe some of them are wrong, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3249.72s)]
*  but at least you got a shot of meeting someone [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3251.32s)]
*  who might have something interesting to say to you. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3253.84s)]

*  There's dancing. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3267.52s)]
*  There's, you know, Baca Neoya. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3268.76s)]
*  There's people getting their nails done. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3273.48s)]
*  Sometimes you pop into a live, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3275.64s)]
*  you don't even know what's going on. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3276.92s)]
*  And you're just seeing some kids live [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3278.76s)]
*  and he's eating a burger. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3279.6s)]
*  There's some kid eating, look at this fucking burger. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3280.7200000000003s)]
*  There's some kid like in a broth who lives [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3283.8s)]
*  like under a brothel or something in Scotland. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3285.88s)]
*  And somebody gave him a big burger. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3288.2400000000002s)]
*  And he just made this video. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3290.84s)]
*  He's like, look at this burger. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3292.36s)]
*  And it's like eight parties, eight parties stocked up boys. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3294.08s)]
*  And it fucking went crazy, right? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3297.8s)]
*  And that kid could be the next governor of Glasgow, right? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3299.96s)]
*  But it's like, that's the thing I think, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3303.8s)]
*  because people also can maybe over time, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3305.92s)]
*  maybe they get to know you. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3307.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but yeah, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3309.48s)]
*  I think it's fascinating, man. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3310.76s)]
*  And TikTok, it does pull more of my information. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3312.12s)]
*  And that's the only thing I just want it to be fair. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3314.6800000000003s)]
*  That's my thing. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3317.32s)]

*  Don't say that this truth can't come out [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3319.48s)]

*  Like just make it fair. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3324.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3325.88s)]
*  If America isn't a country that's American [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3326.7200000000003s)]
*  and it's a country that's owned by other countries, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3330.08s)]
*  tell me that. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3332.8s)]
*  If that's the case, but just let me live fair. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3333.72s)]
*  Let me live through the truth. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3335.8799999999997s)]
*  Look, 100%, I completely agree. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3338.56s)]
*  And then also it's just like, I think, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3340.9599999999996s)]
*  like I was saying before, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3344.2s)]
*  I don't trust any of you motherfuckers [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3345.4399999999996s)]
*  to be the arbiter of what is true and what isn't true. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3347.72s)]
*  So forget anyone having this control [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3350.9599999999996s)]
*  over getting to decide what's misinformation [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3353.2s)]
*  or what's disinformation. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3355.4399999999996s)]
*  Cause it's like the old Lord Atkin quote about like, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3356.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, the Atkins diet? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3362.4399999999996s)]
*  He's the original. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3364.52s)]
*  No, it was before that. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3365.36s)]
*  He didn't figure that out. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3366.2s)]
*  But he's the guy who said- [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3367.72s)]
*  Lord Atkin or Atkin? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3368.56s)]
*  Atkin. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3369.64s)]
*  Man, am I messing with Atkin, I believe. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3370.64s)]
*  He's the one who said the quote about power corrupt. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3373.16s)]
*  Power tends to corrupt. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3376.2s)]
*  Absolute power corrupts absolutely. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3377.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's like, as soon as you have the power [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3379.24s)]
*  to determine what the truth is, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3381.2799999999997s)]
*  then you're corrupted already. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3383.24s)]
*  Just by like having that power. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3385.08s)]
*  And I never liked fucking rich people anyway, bruh. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3386.3199999999997s)]
*  Facts, dude. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3388.2799999999997s)]
*  I fucking hated them. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3389.36s)]
*  I didn't hate them, but I didn't fucking like them. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3391.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3393.6s)]
*  You know? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3394.44s)]
*  I don't, yeah, I just, I don't know. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3395.2799999999997s)]
*  And maybe, yeah, and I have money now and that's true, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3396.7599999999998s)]
*  but I'll never fucking really have money, motherfucker. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3399.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3403.24s)]
*  Not like deep inside of me. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3404.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3405.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3406.48s)]

*  Now you need three more generations of Vons [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3409.2s)]
*  before you're like a real rich prick [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3411.68s)]
*  who just thinks they're better, like an old money. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3414.6s)]
*  Oh, deep inside, dog. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3416.52s)]

*  You feel me? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3419.48s)]
*  What else are we, oh, but Kevin O'Leary, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3421.72s)]
*  I think I wanted to get that right. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3423.8799999999997s)]
*  It was 250 million they offered to an investor [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3424.96s)]
*  and Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary is willing [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3428.68s)]
*  to pay up to 20 billion for TikTok, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3430.7599999999998s)]
*  calling it a legacy opportunity. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3432.52s)]
*  I think that that is a steal. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3434.56s)]
*  Well, Elon bought Twitter for 44 billion, I think, right? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3437.56s)]
*  But he's getting his use out of it. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3441.24s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't sleep. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3442.8799999999997s)]
*  He doesn't seem to be enjoying himself on there. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3443.72s)]
*  Is he addicted to Twitter, do you think? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3445.64s)]
*  He tweets a lot. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3447.3999999999996s)]

*  How many tweets, and he tweets more than we think, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3452.44s)]
*  I think, Dave. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3454.36s)]
*  It's constant. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3455.2000000000003s)]
*  I've clicked on his thing before and been like, Jesus. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3456.6s)]
*  How do we see how many? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3462.0s)]

*  Like, I wanna compare this to. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3484.52s)]
*  Are you big on there, Davey? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3486.76s)]

*  But how have you been on? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3495.1200000000003s)]
*  I've spent too much time on Twitter. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3495.96s)]

*  Well, it says January 2012, so I guess that's. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3502.6800000000003s)]
*  And how long has Elon been on? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3505.88s)]
*  I guess he was on before, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3507.28s)]
*  but when did he start really getting in there? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3508.36s)]
*  I think a lot of his have come recently. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3510.36s)]
*  Past year. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3513.44s)]

*  He does. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3521.0800000000004s)]
*  He seems like he's enjoying. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3522.4s)]
*  He's enjoying kind of. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3524.7200000000003s)]

*  I mean, really drastically. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3639.0s)]
*  And it's not gone, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3640.64s)]
*  like there are still people who are getting censored, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3643.16s)]
*  and there are still, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3646.88s)]
*  there was a thing like a couple weeks ago, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3647.7200000000003s)]
*  where I guess a group of people who, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3649.68s)]
*  let's say the people who, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3652.64s)]
*  liberals would call anti-Semitic, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3656.7999999999997s)]
*  and I think, you know, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3660.0s)]
*  like people who talk a lot about the Jews, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3661.44s)]
*  whatever the, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3663.52s)]
*  I'm not like trying to add my own value judgment into this, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3664.7599999999998s)]
*  but whatever you think you would call it, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3667.12s)]
*  a lot of them lost their blue check marks, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3668.72s)]
*  and like stuff like that. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3670.8399999999997s)]
*  What they were accusing people to do an anti-Semitic? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3672.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3674.04s)]
*  So there have been, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3674.92s)]
*  like there are, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3676.3199999999997s)]
*  but I mean, to compare it to like, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3677.16s)]
*  I mean during like 2020, 2021, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3679.44s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3683.36s)]
*  if you said anything about like the vaccine or whatever, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3684.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3687.32s)]
*  I know you felt it with, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3688.16s)]
*  you know, you had the thing when Dana White was on, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3689.36s)]
*  you were talking about sponsors [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3691.04s)]
*  giving you a hard time and stuff. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3692.52s)]
*  There was a total, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3694.52s)]
*  not just on social media, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3695.4s)]
*  but in general, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3696.52s)]
*  there was a total like feeling that like, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3697.36s)]
*  you weren't even allowed to say anything [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3699.2s)]
*  that went against the regime. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3702.48s)]
*  Like the regime is this. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3704.16s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3705.6s)]
*  And if you are against what they're doing right now, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3706.44s)]
*  and I mean, I, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3708.8s)]
*  you know, there's always pressure. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3709.84s)]
*  Like there's always like, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3711.3999999999996s)]
*  you'll get called names or something if you do that. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3712.7999999999997s)]
*  But for a while there, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3715.4799999999996s)]
*  it was straight up like, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3716.72s)]
*  you would lose your accounts. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3717.56s)]
*  And for a lot of people, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3719.9599999999996s)]
*  like for me, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3721.3999999999996s)]
*  that was a scary prospect for a long time. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3724.64s)]
*  Cause it was kind of like, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3726.9199999999996s)]
*  we had at least in the comedy world that I'm in, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3727.9199999999996s)]
*  and in the political shit talking world that I'm in, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3731.3999999999996s)]
*  it's, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3735.16s)]
*  I had kind of long ago accepted like, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3736.4399999999996s)]
*  okay, I'm not gonna get like a corporate job. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3738.56s)]
*  Like no big corporation is gonna hire me at this point, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3740.72s)]
*  because which is fine. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3743.9599999999996s)]
*  But then you're like, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3745.3999999999996s)]
*  oh, there's this internet thing. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3746.24s)]
*  So you can have your show on the internet. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3747.12s)]
*  You can have your own fans. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3748.64s)]
*  But then when you have your own voice, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3750.12s)]
*  yeah, but then you're like, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3751.7999999999997s)]
*  oh, they might come and take that away. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3752.64s)]
*  It's not just that you can't get Saturday night live [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3754.3599999999997s)]
*  or something on Comedy Central or something like that, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3756.3599999999997s)]
*  but it's like, oh, they could come in like, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3758.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, if you, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3760.8799999999997s)]
*  you could have your podcast, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3761.72s)]
*  but if you can't have, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3763.4399999999996s)]
*  if you can't be on iTunes or YouTube or Facebook [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3764.48s)]
*  or Twitter or whatever, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3767.16s)]
*  you're kind of screwed in this world. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3769.04s)]
*  And so I am very happy that at least now, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3770.8s)]
*  it at least kind of feels like, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3774.0s)]
*  the dominant culture seems to more be like, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3775.96s)]
*  no, we should be able to say what we wanna say right now. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3779.2s)]
*  I think that's a very positive change. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3781.7599999999998s)]
*  But are you, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3784.2s)]
*  are you thinking you're gonna take me down [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3785.04s)]
*  for talking about Yan Yahu? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3785.88s)]
*  No, I think you're gonna be okay on this one. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3787.7599999999998s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3790.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, I would hate to say that. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3790.84s)]
*  And then like next week, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3792.72s)]
*  you just show up at my house and you're just like, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3794.4s)]
*  hey man, can I crash for a while? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3796.04s)]
*  Cause you ruined me. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3797.28s)]
*  So that's, I'm gonna be like, all right. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3798.88s)]
*  But you can be anti-Yan Yahu and not, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3800.6400000000003s)]
*  and that's, you can, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3803.84s)]
*  I can have that belief if I want, right? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3805.2000000000003s)]
*  If I don't like these practices. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3806.7200000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3807.88s)]
*  And it's, oh, it's so ridiculous. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3808.7200000000003s)]
*  The idea of like, in the same way, if you were like, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3810.28s)]
*  well, I don't like Joe Biden very much. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3812.92s)]
*  And you'd be like, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3814.92s)]
*  so does that mean you hate Americans? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3815.76s)]
*  You'd be like, what? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3818.0400000000004s)]
*  No, I just don't like this guy. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3819.0400000000004s)]
*  And you could hate the whole government [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3821.0s)]
*  and not hate the people. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3822.6000000000004s)]
*  And then, and it's only with Israel [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3824.28s)]
*  and they intentionally do this [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3826.7599999999998s)]
*  where they conflate this thing, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3827.9599999999996s)]
*  where it's like, oh, if I have the, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3829.48s)]
*  if I, like, if I was like, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3830.64s)]
*  if I came and told you like, you know, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3832.16s)]
*  the government of France just did this thing, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3833.48s)]
*  I think it's terrible what they did. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3835.8799999999997s)]
*  Or there's lots of terrible things [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3837.56s)]
*  that the government of France has done. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3838.8799999999997s)]
*  So I could pick some, but like whatever. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3840.08s)]
*  That doesn't mean I'm not gonna cheer for Cyril Gagne [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3841.7599999999998s)]
*  when he fights. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3843.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but and you were like, you're an anti-Frankite. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3844.12s)]
*  You hate all the French people. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3846.7599999999998s)]
*  You'd be like, that doesn't even make sense [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3848.04s)]
*  as a response to I have a problem with the government. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3849.48s)]
*  You know? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3851.8799999999997s)]
*  But they tried it. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3853.16s)]
*  They, they use that, you know, with Israel [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3854.0s)]
*  where it's like, oh, if you criticize them, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3856.32s)]
*  you hate Jewish people. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3857.7200000000003s)]
*  What is that? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3859.0400000000004s)]
*  That's stupid. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3859.88s)]
*  It started becoming the boy that cried wolf [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3860.7200000000003s)]
*  because they would say that for everything. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3862.0800000000004s)]
*  And then it would be like, well, what are you, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3864.0400000000004s)]
*  you're not even, you're, you're doing this. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3865.2400000000002s)]
*  You're saying this. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3868.36s)]
*  This isn't true, right? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3869.8s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not even clear sometimes, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3871.32s)]
*  like what do you even mean by that? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3872.96s)]
*  Like, what are you even, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3875.4s)]
*  and also I do think just like the whole woke-ism stuff [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3876.4s)]
*  has been so rejected, especially recently, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3879.5600000000004s)]
*  that you're like, people are kind of sick of just like, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3882.5600000000004s)]
*  accusations of bigotry aren't actually a response [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3884.8799999999997s)]
*  to someone, you know? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3889.12s)]
*  If you're like, if I say, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3890.4399999999996s)]
*  I think what Israel's doing is wrong, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3892.24s)]
*  and your response is, well, you're a bigot, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3894.3999999999996s)]
*  it's like, no, your response should be, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3896.48s)]
*  oh, I don't think what they're doing is wrong, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3898.8799999999997s)]
*  and here's why. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3900.3599999999997s)]
*  And then we could actually talk about it. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3901.2s)]
*  But just to call someone like, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3902.6s)]
*  oh, you're a Jew hater, you're racist, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3904.04s)]
*  you're homophobic, it's just played out and tired. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3905.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3909.0s)]
*  Let's talk about Zuckerberg a little bit [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3910.0s)]
*  because he just had that kind of about face sort of on, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3911.48s)]
*  and Facebook, they just had that kind of about face [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3914.76s)]
*  on Rogan where he was talking about, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3916.92s)]
*  where's that clip? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3920.8s)]
*  That clip, yeah, right here, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3921.88s)]
*  where he kind of says the Biden administration [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3922.76s)]
*  would call meta to scream and curse it [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3925.8s)]
*  then to censor true information on their platforms. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3928.0s)]
*  This is what Zuckerberg said, right? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3930.76s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3933.04s)]
*  Play it real quick, a little bit of it. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3933.88s)]
*  These people from the Biden administration [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3935.84s)]
*  would call up our team and scream at them and curse. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3938.52s)]
*  And it's like these documents, it's all kind of out there. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3942.64s)]
*  Did you record any of those phone calls? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3946.04s)]
*  I don't, no, I don't think we were. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3947.76s)]
*  But I think. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3949.76s)]
*  I wanna listen. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3950.6s)]
*  I mean, there are emails. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3951.44s)]
*  The emails are published. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3952.48s)]
*  It's all kind of out there. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3953.44s)]
*  And they're like, and basically it just got to this point [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3955.0s)]
*  where we were like, no, we're not gonna take down things [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3959.84s)]
*  that are true. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3963.16s)]
*  That's ridiculous. Okay, that's good. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3964.16s)]
*  Do you want us to take down this meme of Lienard? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3965.88s)]
*  What do you think about this? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3969.6800000000003s)]
*  To me, I just don't know if I buy, I don't. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3970.84s)]
*  Cause Facebook didn't do the best job of, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3974.04s)]
*  you know, they had issues over the years [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3977.6s)]
*  with the Hunter Biden thing, right? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3979.04s)]
*  With Russia stuff where they wouldn't let people say, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3980.76s)]
*  this is bullshit. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3983.6s)]
*  Like they really chose to decide what was misinformation. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3984.44s)]
*  So it just seems weird that suddenly people are calling [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3988.6400000000003s)]
*  and screaming. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3991.52s)]
*  I love like the simple facts. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3992.44s)]
*  And you're like, is this? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3994.56s)]
*  It seemed like now you're trying to seem like, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=3997.4s)]
*  like that wasn't happening the whole time [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4002.7999999999997s)]
*  and you weren't listening to it before type of vibe. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4004.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very like convenient retelling of history. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4006.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4010.84s)]
*  For Zuckerberg to go. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4011.68s)]
*  So the government was saying we have to censor these things [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4014.2s)]
*  that are true. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4018.0s)]
*  And we were like, no, we're not gonna do that. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4018.84s)]
*  Okay, what really happened is the government said [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4022.92s)]
*  you're gonna censor these things that are true. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4025.12s)]
*  And he said, yes, sir. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4026.88s)]
*  And did it for eight fucking years, okay? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4028.6s)]
*  And then at the end of these eight years, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4031.6s)]
*  when Trump wins a dominant victory, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4034.28s)]
*  and now the guy who you kicked off of Facebook [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4036.8s)]
*  is now president again, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4039.4s)]
*  and now the whole culture's turned against you [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4040.96s)]
*  and he's threatening to like, you know, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4043.16s)]
*  like look into you. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4045.2000000000003s)]
*  He's coming. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4046.2400000000002s)]
*  And there's a lot of like pretty quasi illegal stuff [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4047.08s)]
*  that was done. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4050.6s)]
*  So now you said, okay, we're not gonna do this again. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4052.2s)]
*  While Joe Biden is literally on his hands and knees [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4054.6s)]
*  pooping his pants on the way out with terrible numbers [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4058.68s)]
*  and Donald Trump's coming in popular again. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4062.52s)]
*  So, okay, yes. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4064.52s)]
*  So for him to spin that as the government said [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4065.48s)]
*  we should do this thing and we said no, that's ridiculous. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4068.48s)]
*  Okay, that's not exactly what happened. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4071.68s)]
*  It seemed like he's just out back here [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4073.6s)]
*  trying to slurp back on humanity. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4075.32s)]
*  Now, if you- [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4077.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a slurp job. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4078.44s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4079.36s)]
*  Now there's, and this is why Joe, you know, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4081.48s)]
*  remains like the biggest show [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4084.28s)]
*  is cause he just gets these moments. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4086.6000000000004s)]
*  But if you, the last time he was on Rogan's podcast [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4088.6400000000003s)]
*  was one of the most interesting admissions [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4091.96s)]
*  and it was before he had done this 180 and turned around. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4093.76s)]
*  But when Joe asked him about the Hunter Biden thing [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4096.360000000001s)]
*  and he goes, so like the story with the Hunter Biden laptop, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4099.96s)]
*  how did you guys handle that? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4103.16s)]
*  And Zuckerberg said the FBI came to us and told us [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4104.76s)]
*  there's about to be a big Russian dump. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4109.6s)]
*  So they must have known that this laptop [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4112.320000000001s)]
*  was about to come out. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4114.92s)]
*  And they went to Facebook, told them preemptively [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4116.56s)]
*  it's Russian disinformation. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4119.320000000001s)]
*  And that's why they censored the whole thing. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4120.96s)]
*  And that is like, that admission is like blatant election [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4123.200000000001s)]
*  interference by the FBI against the sitting president. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4127.6s)]
*  Which makes it even that much worse. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4132.280000000001s)]
*  Cause like on some level, like if the FBI or the CIA [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4134.64s)]
*  or someone like that was like interfering in an election, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4138.12s)]
*  you'd already be like, okay, that's crazy illegal, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4140.36s)]
*  unethical, unconstitutional. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4143.08s)]
*  Like we don't have a democracy [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4146.08s)]
*  if we have three letter agencies interfering in elections. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4147.6s)]
*  However, you'd assume at least they were doing it [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4150.72s)]
*  on the side of the president who they work for, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4153.68s)]
*  not against the president who they work for. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4156.44s)]
*  Now we're in a level of like treason. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4159.12s)]
*  Like you're working against the commander in chief [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4161.6s)]
*  who you're supposed to say, sir, yes, sir to. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4165.08s)]
*  And follow his rules. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4168.52s)]
*  You know, I mean, okay, if you're at the FBI, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4169.4800000000005s)]
*  you're under the justice department. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4171.8s)]
*  But still like the president is the head of the executive. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4173.4400000000005s)]
*  So this was in Trump was in office? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4176.08s)]
*  Yeah, the one I'm referring to, yes, this one. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4177.84s)]
*  This is when, or I don't know when the podcast was, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4180.72s)]
*  but he's talking about the Hunter Biden story, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4183.360000000001s)]
*  which was October of 2020. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4185.68s)]
*  So right before the election when Trump is still in office. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4187.92s)]
*  Okay, let's play a little bit of that. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4190.24s)]
*  How do you guys handle things [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4193.6s)]
*  when they're a big news item that's controversial? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4195.36s)]
*  Like there was a lot of attention on Twitter [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4199.719999999999s)]
*  during the election because of the Hunter Biden [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4203.24s)]
*  laptop story, the New York Post. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4205.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so you guys censored that as well? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4208.24s)]
*  So we took a different path than Twitter. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4210.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, basically the background here is the FBI, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4213.719999999999s)]
*  I think basically came to us, some folks on our team. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4216.639999999999s)]
*  It was like, hey, just so you know, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4219.5599999999995s)]
*  like you should be on high alert. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4222.24s)]
*  We thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4224.4400000000005s)]
*  in the 2016 election. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4226.92s)]
*  We have it on notice that basically there's about to be [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4228.76s)]
*  some kind of dump that's similar to that. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4233.320000000001s)]
*  So just be vigilant. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4238.0s)]
*  So our protocol is different from Twitter's. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4239.320000000001s)]
*  What Twitter did is they said, you can't share this at all. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4241.8s)]
*  We didn't do that. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4245.56s)]
*  What we do is we have, if something's reported to us [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4246.4800000000005s)]
*  as potentially misinformation, important misinformation, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4250.68s)]
*  we also have this third party fact checking program [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4254.92s)]
*  because we don't wanna be deciding what's true and false. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4257.400000000001s)]
*  And for the, I think it was five or seven days [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4259.68s)]
*  when it was basically being determined whether it was false, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4263.84s)]
*  the distribution on Facebook was decreased, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4271.320000000001s)]
*  but people were still allowed to share it. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4274.16s)]
*  So you could still share it, you could still consume it. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4275.56s)]
*  Do you wanna say the distribution has decreased? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4278.240000000001s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4281.32s)]
*  So saying that they had some effect on it though. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4282.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, he goes on to say that it was a meaningful [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4285.32s)]
*  impact that turning down the signal had on it. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4288.5599999999995s)]
*  But what's interesting is that he blatantly says [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4292.4s)]
*  that it was the FBI who came to them and told them [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4294.599999999999s)]
*  that this very true story, which was a real scandal [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4297.599999999999s)]
*  that was an October surprise that very clearly [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4302.12s)]
*  could have moved the needle in the election, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4305.5199999999995s)]
*  they suppressed that for one reason only. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4307.44s)]
*  And that's because they wanted Biden to win [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4310.88s)]
*  and not Trump to win. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4312.28s)]
*  And Zuckerberg played a big role in that, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4313.68s)]
*  not as big, I guess, as Twitter, at the old Twitter. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4316.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, Dorsey admitted it. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4319.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4320.36s)]
*  And look, I do think to some degree, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4321.32s)]
*  these guys are under duress from the government. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4324.68s)]
*  I mean, they're threatened and all types of pressure [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4328.2s)]
*  is put on them to go along with the censorship stuff. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4330.28s)]
*  And to be, you're basically become communication [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4333.0s)]
*  in the universe. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4336.2s)]
*  You are, if everybody had to talk in a hallway, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4337.04s)]
*  you're the hallway. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4340.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, and if you think about even just the, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4343.32s)]
*  if you think about how much government cares [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4347.08s)]
*  about controlling the narrative, one of the things [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4350.28s)]
*  that's really interesting from the more recent clip, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4352.68s)]
*  the one we played first here, he says that they were [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4355.04s)]
*  really upset about a meme. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4358.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was Leonardo DiCaprio. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4361.5199999999995s)]
*  A Leonardo DiCaprio meme. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4363.44s)]
*  They were really upset about that. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4364.8s)]
*  Which literally, isn't that fascinating in a way [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4367.16s)]
*  that they are so threatened by you making a joke [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4369.36s)]
*  about their bullshit? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4372.2s)]
*  But if you zoom out and think about it, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4373.4s)]
*  it's like governments always insist on controlling, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4375.959999999999s)]
*  monopolizing information. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4380.04s)]
*  Controlling the narrative is the most important thing [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4382.48s)]
*  to them. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4384.839999999999s)]
*  That's more important than controlling the money [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4385.679999999999s)]
*  or the banks or the laws or anything. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4387.0s)]
*  It's like controlling the narrative, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4389.44s)]
*  controlling how people think, what the kind of like, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4390.799999999999s)]
*  the range, the Overton window of allowable opinion [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4394.64s)]
*  or what, and you see it all the time. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4398.120000000001s)]
*  You see they spaz out when people are just outside [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4400.4400000000005s)]
*  of the realm of allowable opinion. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4403.400000000001s)]
*  And even if you think about the way, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4405.4400000000005s)]
*  think about the way our government's set up. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4408.240000000001s)]
*  We're like, okay, the government, there's like a group [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4410.08s)]
*  of services that the government has a monopoly on. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4414.200000000001s)]
*  And they had a monopoly on the schools, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4420.0s)]
*  the post office. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4423.98s)]
*  You know? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4425.62s)]
*  It's like wherever the information is coming from, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4426.459999999999s)]
*  the media, the universities, you know, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4430.419999999999s)]
*  these are always the things that governments get involved [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4432.78s)]
*  and then all of a sudden there's a revolution. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4434.94s)]
*  And now the public square is Facebook and Twitter [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4437.54s)]
*  and these social media. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4445.299999999999s)]
*  So now these people are in control [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4446.259999999999s)]
*  for the first time of this. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4447.86s)]
*  So of course, and what really happened was [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4448.98s)]
*  after Donald Trump won in 2016, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4450.94s)]
*  they really started cracking down on them. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4452.98s)]
*  But they realized like, the guy who wasn't supposed [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4454.66s)]
*  to win won and he did it by utilizing social media [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4457.0199999999995s)]
*  and going around the corporate media [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4460.419999999999s)]
*  and going around the political machine [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4463.5s)]
*  just to talk right to voters. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4465.74s)]
*  That really shook them up. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4467.0599999999995s)]
*  And so yeah, they hauled Zuckerberg and Dorsey [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4468.339999999999s)]
*  and all of them before Congress. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4471.419999999999s)]
*  They threatened the shit out of them. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4472.639999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he's right that they were on the phone [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4473.98s)]
*  cursing and screaming at him [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4475.86s)]
*  and putting all types of pressure. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4477.0599999999995s)]
*  So fine, if Zuckerberg, I would be much more sympathetic [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4478.74s)]
*  if Zuckerberg had come out on Rogan's podcast this time [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4482.139999999999s)]
*  and been like, listen, I've just, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4484.94s)]
*  I've, under the weight of this pressure, I gave in. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4487.26s)]
*  And I became like a tool for the regime to censor people. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4490.22s)]
*  But I don't wanna do that anymore. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4493.94s)]
*  And so now I'm committing to this. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4495.46s)]
*  I'd be like, yes, he's a hero. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4497.0199999999995s)]
*  But the way he kinda like yada yada's over like, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4499.26s)]
*  anyway, the government wanted to do this stuff. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4502.26s)]
*  I was like, nah, man, I'm not gonna do that. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4504.12s)]
*  I'm cool, right, Rogan? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4506.139999999999s)]
*  And they're like, eh, not exactly. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4507.46s)]
*  It almost seems, sometimes the way he, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4509.66s)]
*  he almost seems like a doll. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4511.860000000001s)]
*  Does he a little bit when you, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4515.46s)]
*  and I don't mean it in a bad way. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4516.66s)]
*  I just mean it in an interesting way. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4519.14s)]
*  I'm fascinated by the guy. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4520.62s)]
*  I mean, I can't imagine what his life is like [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4522.14s)]
*  or what he's like as a person [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4524.62s)]
*  or what it's like to talk with him. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4527.38s)]
*  I would love to have that opportunity. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4528.66s)]
*  But I am, yeah, I'm just so curious as to like the pressure [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4530.42s)]
*  if he feels it, you know, they had that one moment [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4535.26s)]
*  where like they had all those families [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4538.9400000000005s)]
*  that had people had been solicited or whatever. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4540.7s)]

*  Okay, that's good. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4598.5s)]
*  I think it just seems like a robot doing it. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4599.34s)]
*  Like that wasn't great. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4601.22s)]
*  That wasn't a great moat. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4603.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why I wondered, does he feel, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4604.78s)]

*  Yeah, listen, that's, yeah, to apologize. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4609.1s)]
*  I don't even exactly understand what they were like. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4611.34s)]
*  They're, I think a lot of them are like parents of kids [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4613.1s)]
*  who got trafficked or something like that. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4616.14s)]
*  And I'll have to look into that. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4617.9s)]
*  But that also shouldn't be done, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4619.5s)]
*  like an apology like that shouldn't be done [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4620.900000000001s)]
*  with reporters flashing and all this. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4623.46s)]
*  I also cannot stand, I'm sorry, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4625.620000000001s)]
*  but I just hate the grandstanding [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4627.26s)]
*  of politicians in Congress. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4629.3s)]
*  Like I think Zuckerberg's response to that [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4631.34s)]
*  should have been like, you preside over the biggest [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4633.900000000001s)]
*  war machine in the history of the world. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4636.900000000001s)]
*  So if you want to talk about apologizing [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4639.18s)]
*  to innocent people who have got, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4641.740000000001s)]
*  you got your work cut out for you. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4643.1s)]
*  You focus on your apologies, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4644.740000000001s)]
*  but I would love to invite like any of these parents [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4646.3s)]
*  if they want to sit down in a private room after that, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4648.46s)]
*  we can have a long conversation about this. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4650.26s)]
*  And then like give a real moment or like, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4652.66s)]
*  you know, you can't, someone like loses their kid [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4655.34s)]
*  or their kid's or tortured or something. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4657.78s)]
*  It can't just be like, I'm sorry that happened [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4659.58s)]
*  and we are working hard to make sure [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4662.3s)]
*  it doesn't happen in the future. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4663.78s)]
*  You want to sit down and be like, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4665.18s)]
*  hey, tell me your story. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4666.26s)]
*  And don't even hear from me, let me hear from you. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4668.02s)]
*  You tell me your story and then I'll try to like empathize [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4670.34s)]
*  with what you've gone through, but. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4673.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4675.06s)]
*  And they shouldn't put him on the spot [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4676.14s)]
*  to do it right there, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4677.78s)]
*  because that wasn't really helpful. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4678.62s)]
*  Because they're not looking for a sincere apology. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4681.66s)]
*  They're looking for a political stunt to be like, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4683.259999999999s)]
*  I got Zuckerberg to admit that he was wrong. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4685.219999999999s)]
*  And the families always get wheeled out [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4688.78s)]
*  for that kind of stuff. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4690.099999999999s)]
*  And I also don't like that the air is always like, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4690.94s)]
*  it's always a question of what you should be censoring. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4693.62s)]
*  And like, listen, I'm sure we would probably agree, right? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4696.82s)]
*  Like if there are people trying to traffic kids [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4699.46s)]
*  or something like that, like, yes, okay, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4701.38s)]
*  you'd want to kick those accounts off [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4702.7s)]
*  or report them to the police or whatever, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4704.3s)]
*  but it's always Congress talking about how dangerous [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4706.06s)]
*  the freedom that people have is on your site. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4709.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's so dangerous that people can communicate [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4712.42s)]
*  and people, you got to clamp down on this. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4714.740000000001s)]
*  And it's like, personally, I'm much, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4716.9800000000005s)]
*  what is it, the old, I think it's a Thomas Jefferson quote, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4719.700000000001s)]
*  or maybe I'm getting that wrong, actually, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4723.5s)]
*  it's not Jefferson, but whatever the quote was like, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4724.860000000001s)]
*  it might've been Hamilton, but it was like, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4727.3s)]
*  I'd rather deal with the inconveniences of too much liberty [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4728.9800000000005s)]
*  than those associated with too little of it. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4732.860000000001s)]
*  It's always like, they're always warning you [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4736.1s)]
*  about the problems of too much freedom. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4737.740000000001s)]
*  Oh, everyone can communicate, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4739.900000000001s)]
*  that means people are gonna come get your kids. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4741.3s)]
*  I'm like, I'm sure there is that concern, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4743.26s)]
*  and like, I got little kids, I'm concerned about that stuff, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4746.06s)]
*  but I also kind of feel like, okay, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4749.26s)]
*  I'll handle making sure my kids don't, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4751.7s)]
*  you know what I mean, get taken advantage of on the internet, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4753.9800000000005s)]
*  and how about the government get the hell out of the way [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4757.18s)]
*  so we can tell the truth? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4759.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4760.900000000001s)]
*  It was Thomas Jefferson, see, I should be sure of myself. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4761.740000000001s)]
*  I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4764.18s)]
*  attending too much liberty [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4765.900000000001s)]
*  than those attending too small a degree of it. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4769.1s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, why not err on that side of it? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4771.02s)]
*  Yeah, Facebook has had issues, I mean, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4775.3s)]
*  remember when they had, there was a thing where they had, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4776.9800000000005s)]
*  there was like these canyons or something, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4780.780000000001s)]
*  see if you can look that up. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4782.38s)]
*  They were looking up information, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4785.820000000001s)]
*  they were using people in Africa to look up, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4787.62s)]
*  they were the fact checkers or whatever, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4790.660000000001s)]
*  and I think it was a lawsuit. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4792.1s)]
*  Facebook content moderators in Kenya call the work [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=4794.54s)]

*  Yeah, well, it's just interesting, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5000.46s)]
*  at what point do you think [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5001.78s)]
*  that there could be a revolution in America? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5003.86s)]

*  It's like, what is even, like. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5015.74s)]
*  Well, right, and then on top of that, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5018.9s)]
*  you had, say someone like Donald Trump, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5021.860000000001s)]
*  look, the first time Donald Trump ran, right, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5024.860000000001s)]
*  all of the political class, all of the media, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5027.02s)]
*  all of Hollywood, they all said, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5029.860000000001s)]
*  this guy is unacceptable, you cannot support this guy. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5031.900000000001s)]
*  He still won, but he also won on a razor thin margin, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5035.14s)]
*  lost the popular vote, and just happened to win [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5039.900000000001s)]
*  the right swing states against Hillary, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5042.46s)]
*  so there was a little bit of a caveat. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5044.1s)]
*  But then after January 6th, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5046.860000000001s)]
*  with how much they pumped into like, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5049.38s)]
*  this is the worst thing ever, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5051.78s)]
*  and look at this horrible guy, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5053.66s)]
*  you could never support him, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5055.06s)]
*  then they go after him with the legal cases, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5056.7s)]
*  then he almost gets his brains blown out [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5060.5s)]
*  on national television, and then after all of that, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5063.06s)]
*  all the years of he's a Nazi, democracy's over, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5065.900000000001s)]
*  he's Hitler, the American people go, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5068.900000000001s)]
*  well, we like him even more now. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5071.06s)]

*  Hollywood celebrities can't move the needle at all. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5084.099999999999s)]

*  in communication already, there's been a revolution [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5205.3s)]
*  in the media, I mean, they all, this happened a while ago, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5208.26s)]
*  but after this election, they all kind of admit it, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5211.18s)]
*  they all kind of admit that like, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5213.46s)]
*  look like Donald Trump did like your show [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5215.3s)]
*  and Schultz and- [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5219.22s)]
*  Oh, that blew my mind. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5220.9800000000005s)]
*  And this was a huge factor for him, you know, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5222.46s)]
*  and this was, and I will say, I think particularly yours was, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5225.18s)]
*  I mean, obviously Rogan's was humongous, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5228.22s)]
*  but particularly the interview with you [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5230.58s)]
*  saw like a much different side of Donald Trump [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5232.5s)]
*  than I had ever seen before, and that's crazy. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5235.38s)]
*  It's crazy that there's been this revolution, I mean. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5239.58s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy, you know, there hasn't been, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5241.3s)]
*  there's not a lot of people where I'm from [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5243.62s)]
*  who even get to ask questions a lot of times. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5244.62s)]
*  No, I think, I don't think you're- [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5245.740000000001s)]
*  There's not a lot of people where I'm from [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5247.38s)]
*  who ever even get to raise their hand [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5248.82s)]
*  in front of a president and ask a question [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5250.42s)]
*  about something that means something to them. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5252.54s)]
*  You know, a lot of times, yeah, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5254.66s)]
*  you just get pigeonholed into being some type of way, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5257.299999999999s)]
*  and so then as a person, as part of even just a group, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5259.62s)]
*  you start to feel like, well, I don't even fucking exist, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5263.5s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5265.94s)]
*  And I think that's part of how I always felt my whole life. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5266.86s)]
*  I don't even, nobody gives a fuck about poor off white kid, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5268.86s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5272.86s)]
*  That's the last fucking group. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5273.7s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think, I don't know. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5275.7s)]
*  I don't know what I'm saying, man. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5279.46s)]
*  I think it's a really great point. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5281.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you think about it, like, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5282.54s)]
*  at least my whole life, right? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5284.18s)]
*  Well, finally we made our own voices [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5285.7s)]
*  because you don't even see that I am a voice. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5286.94s)]
*  You don't even think I have a fucking voice. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5289.5s)]
*  And so finally, you don't think, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5291.74s)]
*  and you also, you don't think I'll work hard enough [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5294.62s)]
*  to fucking put my voice out there either. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5297.38s)]
*  Dude, they called it flyover country. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5299.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5301.22s)]
*  That's what they call it, flyover country. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5302.0599999999995s)]
*  And what is flyover country? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5304.139999999999s)]
*  Everything except New York and LA, right? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5306.3s)]
*  The whole rest of this annoying country [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5307.9s)]
*  that you gotta fly over on your way from New York to LA. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5309.58s)]
*  If you think about, like, when we grew up, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5312.42s)]
*  me and you grew up in the era of the TV. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5314.9800000000005s)]
*  There wasn't, we didn't watch shit on YouTube, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5317.9s)]
*  and you know, this didn't exist. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5319.9800000000005s)]
*  We watched what was on TV. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5321.54s)]
*  And TV was made in New York and LA. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5323.02s)]
*  That's where it was made. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5326.02s)]
*  And every show, whether it was Seinfeld, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5327.42s)]
*  or Friends, or whatever, it was all, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5330.42s)]
*  these shows were about living in a city on the coast, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5334.34s)]
*  and they were about people who lived there. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5339.06s)]
*  And then just think about how bizarre that is. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5340.740000000001s)]
*  You have this giant country [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5342.62s)]
*  that occupies the middle part of North America, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5344.18s)]
*  called the United States of America. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5346.54s)]
*  It's this huge country, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5348.46s)]
*  and you only have representation [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5350.1s)]
*  from these two coastal cities. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5352.22s)]
*  And this has now been totally blown open [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5354.34s)]
*  where it's like, yeah, I think for the first time, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5357.26s)]
*  people in the middle of the country, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5359.38s)]
*  in the south of the country, can actually have a voice. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5361.46s)]
*  And why shouldn't they, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5364.66s)]
*  when there's tens of millions of people [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5365.78s)]
*  who fall into those categories? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5367.58s)]
*  Look, it's crazy to me, being in stand-up comedy, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5371.3s)]
*  it's been a total revolution since when I started. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5374.66s)]
*  The path for how you become successful is so different. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5378.86s)]
*  Podcasts weren't a thing when I first started. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5381.46s)]
*  And so having a revolution in government, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5383.86s)]
*  that still seems like we're not there, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5386.42s)]
*  but there has been a huge cultural revolution [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5388.86s)]
*  over the last 15 years that are- [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5391.82s)]
*  In communication, or in what is it called? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5393.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think in media, in entertainment, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5395.54s)]
*  in comedy, and yeah. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5398.66s)]
*  So Trump has his new cabinet picks, right? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5400.82s)]
*  Has he picked all of them yet or not? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5403.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's picked all. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5404.9s)]
*  I mean, there might be some more smaller positions [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5406.219999999999s)]
*  that he still gets to pick, like judges and stuff like that, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5409.5s)]
*  but I think he's picked his cabinet. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5412.66s)]
*  What do you feel, who are some of your favorites, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5415.259999999999s)]
*  who are some you're kind of on the fence about? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5417.98s)]
*  Doug Collins got fucking picked? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5420.339999999999s)]
*  The coach? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5422.74s)]
*  The basketball coach? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5423.9s)]
*  Remember he was with the Wizards, dude? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5425.219999999999s)]
*  Wait, are you talking about Jordan's coach, Doug Collins, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5427.459999999999s)]
*  or is this someone else? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5429.58s)]
*  No, that's a different Doug Collins. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5430.459999999999s)]
*  Oh, damn, who's that guy? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5432.299999999999s)]
*  Doug Collins got the bulls right there, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5434.379999999999s)]
*  and then Phil Jackson came in and took all the glory. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5436.419999999999s)]
*  I remember that, dude. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5438.94s)]
*  That's a great point, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5442.54s)]
*  that's never really talked about, is it? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5443.379999999999s)]
*  But what about some of his cabinet picks? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5444.94s)]
*  Where are you at with some of that? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5448.06s)]
*  I love, okay, well the best ones to me by far [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5450.22s)]
*  were Bobby Kennedy for health department was just amazing. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5455.14s)]
*  I think that's really gonna shake things up. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5458.9400000000005s)]
*  Is he one of the first doctors that's never been [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5461.14s)]
*  in charge of the health department? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5463.900000000001s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5464.74s)]
*  I don't know, no, I think the guy who's in the head of it [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5465.74s)]
*  now was a lawyer too, so I'm not sure. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5468.74s)]
*  But he is the first real outsider and real critic [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5472.14s)]
*  of the American health state. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5476.22s)]
*  And so that's really interesting. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5481.06s)]
*  He also put, which I'm sure has a lot to do [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5482.62s)]
*  with Bobby being at HHS, but he put Jay Bhattacharya [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5485.62s)]
*  as the new head of the- [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5490.02s)]
*  Draft kings? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5492.700000000001s)]
*  The, Jay Bhattacharya? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5493.54s)]
*  Yeah, he sounds like a bookie. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5495.06s)]
*  Oh, dude, yeah, well he's got a, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5496.3s)]
*  I think he's Indian, I don't know. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5498.5s)]
*  Oh, Bhattacharya's Indian? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5499.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5501.22s)]
*  I might be wrong about that, if I'm wrong, I apologize. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5502.06s)]
*  But he was one of the signatories [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5504.14s)]
*  on the Great Barrington Declaration. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5506.54s)]
*  He was amazing during COVID. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5508.780000000001s)]
*  He was like a brilliant, he's got a degree, I think, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5510.58s)]
*  in economics and in science. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5514.46s)]
*  Jay Bhattacharya, bring him up. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5516.34s)]
*  He sounds like he's from Madras, New Jersey, dude. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5517.34s)]
*  Bring him up, Jay Bhattacharya. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5521.34s)]
*  Let's get a little gander at him. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5523.1s)]
*  I just wanna get a peek at him. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5524.02s)]
*  I haven't seen his face before. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5525.660000000001s)]
*  Bhattacharya, oh yeah, I like this guy, huh? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5528.42s)]
*  He was phenomenal during COVID. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5531.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5534.74s)]
*  Like a goddamn hero, just calling out all the bullshit [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5535.58s)]
*  and like really. I would love to interview him. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5538.66s)]
*  Dude, that would be great. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5540.099999999999s)]
*  A super, super smart scientist [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5541.54s)]
*  who's like really understood why lockdowns were terrible [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5543.58s)]
*  and why the vaccine mandates were insane [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5547.78s)]
*  and all of that stuff. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5550.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's, you know. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5550.9s)]
*  So he got Fauci's old job. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5551.74s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5554.219999999999s)]
*  Which is gonna be real interesting. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5555.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, head of the NIH. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5556.139999999999s)]
*  Heck yeah, that's cool. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5557.62s)]
*  Now, all these guys gotta be confirmed by the Senate still, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5558.7s)]
*  so that's not done. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5561.14s)]
*  But the other great pick was Tulsi Gabbard [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5562.06s)]
*  as director of national intelligence. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5564.740000000001s)]
*  McCarrie, do you know who that is? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5568.62s)]
*  Marty. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5571.780000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5573.54s)]
*  Marty McCarrie, can you look him up? [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5574.38s)]
*  Marty McCarrie for FDA commissioner. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5577.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, I don't know enough about this guy. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5579.46s)]
*  He has a great book called The Price We Pay. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5581.700000000001s)]
*  Bring up one of his books. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5583.54s)]
*  I wanna talk with this guy. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5584.38s)]
*  It's about the insurance, the whole, the scam, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5586.780000000001s)]
*  what broke American healthcare. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5590.0199999999995s)]
*  There's another great book he has too. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5591.86s)]
*  Dude, one of his books, he has this thing like, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5594.0199999999995s)]
*  where they were going to black churches, okay? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5596.419999999999s)]
*  He's a surgeon. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5600.62s)]
*  Let me see, Martin and Ed McCarrie, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5602.98s)]
*  he's a British American surgeon, professor, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5604.78s)]
*  author, and medical commentator. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5606.379999999999s)]
*  Where they were going to, they were convincing, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5609.94s)]
*  giving people scans at their churches, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5612.62s)]
*  showing them that they needed like, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5614.82s)]
*  their blood vessels dilated or shunts put in their legs. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5616.94s)]
*  And it was just, and doctors were making a ton of money [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5620.219999999999s)]
*  through Medicaid, it was just this big scam. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5622.94s)]
*  And a lot of the doctors were funding the groups [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5625.0199999999995s)]
*  that would go and they would do it at black churches [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5627.5s)]
*  and black religious get togethers. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5630.419999999999s)]
*  And they'd have tables set up and they were just using [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5632.86s)]
*  these people, basically sending them through [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5635.219999999999s)]
*  as just like a fucking, as a varicose vein mill. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5637.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. Unreal. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5641.7s)]
*  And just making tons of money, I'm sure. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5642.9s)]
*  Yeah, but he talks about that. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5645.0599999999995s)]
*  He talks about a lot of neat stuff. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5647.66s)]
*  Oh, that's another one, blind spots. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5648.5s)]
*  When medicine, that's one I've been reading. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5649.34s)]
*  When medicine goes wrong, that's one that I've been reading. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5651.38s)]
*  But he seems like an interesting guy, but he got put in, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5653.98s)]
*  that's one I'm excited about. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5656.0599999999995s)]
*  Gabbard, you said, who else is in there? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5658.82s)]
*  Cash Patel, who took over the FBI. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5664.46s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5669.0599999999995s)]
*  FBI director, he was a huge critic of like, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5669.9s)]
*  Russiagate and a lot of the crazy stuff that, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5672.34s)]
*  a lot of the election interference that the FBI [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5674.66s)]
*  has been doing. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5677.14s)]
*  Again, we're gonna see how, there were reports out, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5678.18s)]
*  I'm not sure if this is true or not, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5682.34s)]
*  but that Tulsi Gabbard was saying she's changed her mind [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5684.0199999999995s)]
*  on government surveillance and now she's okay [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5686.9s)]
*  with the intelligence agencies spying on us. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5689.5s)]
*  DC has a way of poisoning people. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5692.18s)]
*  But how does that happen? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5694.38s)]
*  But also, I'm not throwing her under the bus [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5695.34s)]
*  or nothing like that. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5697.0199999999995s)]
*  I think maybe she's saying what she needs to say [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5697.86s)]
*  to get confirmed and then she'll do some really great stuff [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5699.94s)]
*  once she's there. Could that be something that happens? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5702.26s)]
*  Quite possibly, it's hard to say. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5703.78s)]
*  But it is like, there's all types of pressure [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5706.139999999999s)]
*  and then there's probably pressures [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5709.34s)]
*  that I don't know about at all, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5710.86s)]
*  that when you're actually on the inside, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5712.46s)]
*  there's probably all types of threats and things like that [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5714.219999999999s)]
*  that you gotta deal with. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5716.3s)]
*  So I think these picks were all very, very good. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5717.139999999999s)]
*  He had a bunch of really bad picks that I did not like. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5720.66s)]
*  Let me see, let's finish this one. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5723.78s)]
*  Gabbard 43 was born in the US territory of American Samoa, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5724.94s)]
*  raised in Hawaii and spent a year of her childhood [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5728.82s)]
*  in the Philippines. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5730.34s)]
*  Yeah, she's definitely, I love the way that she talks. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5732.400000000001s)]
*  I love how just her own, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5735.72s)]
*  she always seems to have her very own voice. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5737.8s)]
*  But when you get in, who compromised, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5741.8s)]
*  what do they use to compromise? [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5745.4400000000005s)]
*  You think, that's what I always wonder. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5746.84s)]
*  I mean, I think, I don't know. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5748.8s)]
*  You didn't get to say, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5750.6s)]
*  you're gonna have to do what we want [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5751.88s)]
*  or we're gonna kill you. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5752.92s)]
*  You think that's what it is? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5753.76s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5754.580000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't put it past some of these people. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5755.76s)]
*  There are a lot of killers in our government. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5757.8s)]
*  I also think that sometimes it's just the way [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5761.8s)]
*  the machine works and it's like, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5764.240000000001s)]
*  well, you're never gonna be able to do anything [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5766.280000000001s)]
*  unless you do this or unless you do that. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5768.200000000001s)]
*  It was real interesting the way that Obama got rolled [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5771.040000000001s)]
*  when he first came in and he had a lot of these plans, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5776.88s)]
*  like we were gonna end these wars [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5779.8s)]
*  and we're gonna do all these things and we're gonna, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5781.320000000001s)]
*  and he just immediately ran up against the machine [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5783.320000000001s)]
*  and it was like, you have no idea [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5786.8s)]
*  how to actually control this thing. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5788.4400000000005s)]
*  And I gotta say, I think that happened a lot to Trump too [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5790.44s)]
*  when he first came in. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5792.799999999999s)]
*  Trump had a lot of plans and I think that, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5794.16s)]
*  I think Donald Trump looked at it like, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5796.08s)]
*  hey, I've been the CEO of this big company. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5798.679999999999s)]
*  I've been the boss before. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5800.599999999999s)]
*  I'll go be the boss again. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5801.599999999999s)]
*  But it's like, that's not how this one works. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5803.44s)]
*  This is a whole different thing. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5805.48s)]
*  It's not like when you're really the boss [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5806.799999999999s)]
*  and you dictate orders and everyone follows them. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5808.599999999999s)]
*  And he, Donald Trump, he ran in 2016 [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5810.96s)]
*  on what was such a great idea at the time [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5815.759999999999s)]
*  and he used to say this on the campaign all the time [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5819.44s)]
*  in 2016, because back then the war in Syria [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5821.08s)]
*  was still going, well, it was like raging. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5823.44s)]
*  And he would go, why are we even in Syria? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5825.64s)]
*  I don't care about overthrowing Bashar al-Assad. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5829.04s)]
*  He goes, Russia said they're only in Syria to kill ISIS. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5831.12s)]
*  And he was like, okay, well, we wanna kill ISIS too. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5834.4s)]
*  We're against the terrorists. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5836.88s)]
*  He goes, so why don't we stop trying to overthrow regimes [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5837.84s)]
*  in the Middle East, work with Russia [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5840.76s)]
*  to take out all the terrorists, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5842.8s)]
*  and then we could just leave the Middle East [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5844.2s)]
*  and then we could be friends with Russia. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5845.8s)]
*  And he openly ran on that. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5848.32s)]
*  It was like, yeah, that's a great idea. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5849.88s)]
*  Except then you get in there and the media's saying [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5851.96s)]
*  you're a Russian spy every single day, all day long. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5855.12s)]
*  So now how are you gonna make a deal with Russia? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5857.96s)]
*  When everyone's saying you're a Russian spy. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5860.2s)]
*  Oh, they tricked you then because. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5861.5599999999995s)]
*  If you make a deal with Russia, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5863.16s)]
*  that'll just be proof that you're a Russian spy. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5864.24s)]
*  And so then Donald Trump went, no, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5866.48s)]
*  I'll be hawkish toward Russia. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5869.2s)]
*  And so he went out of his way to prove [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5871.0s)]
*  what a Russian spy he wasn't, which is like, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5872.7s)]
*  oh, so they got you. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5875.28s)]
*  So you couldn't do what you wanted to do. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5876.6s)]
*  And instead you gotta do this. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5878.6s)]
*  But this time they may not have the value of the media. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5879.88s)]
*  Well, they for sure don't. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5882.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5884.04s)]
*  Unless they come and kill all the podcasters and stuff, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5886.080000000001s)]
*  do you think that they could do that? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5888.120000000001s)]
*  Have you ever worried about your own safety? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5889.280000000001s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5890.96s)]
*  I've always felt like I fly at a nice, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5892.6s)]
*  I'm far enough from the sun that I'm okay. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5896.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, same, I don't know what I'm even doing. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5898.96s)]
*  Well, right, so I'm not. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5901.200000000001s)]
*  And also I do think there's too many of us [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5902.76s)]
*  and I think the toothpaste is out of the tube on this. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5906.2s)]
*  And I don't think, I think even they've finally realized [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5908.88s)]
*  that even if, you know, it was funny, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5912.2s)]
*  when they were coming after Rogan a couple years ago [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5914.12s)]
*  when there was that major push and the artists were, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5916.16s)]
*  you know, Neil Young was saying, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5919.12s)]
*  I'll take my music off Spotify or whatever. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5921.64s)]
*  I remember talking about it then. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5924.4400000000005s)]
*  And you're like, so what do you guys even think happens? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5926.28s)]
*  Let's say, hypothetically, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5929.16s)]
*  you could take Joe Rogan out, right? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5931.08s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5933.4800000000005s)]
*  And then the audience goes back to CNN. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5934.48s)]
*  You think everyone who was listening to that is gonna go, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5936.5599999999995s)]
*  okay, I guess we plug back into the matrix now. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5938.5599999999995s)]
*  They're just gonna find somebody else. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5941.5199999999995s)]
*  They're gonna find someone else, probably more radical. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5943.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5945.679999999999s)]
*  Probably not less. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5946.5199999999995s)]
*  And so I think they even kind of know they can't really, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5947.799999999999s)]
*  you know, but I do think, I think the two things [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5951.24s)]
*  that make it, that make the dynamic very different [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5954.2s)]
*  this time for Trump, well, like you said, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5957.599999999999s)]
*  it's that the corporate media has been destroyed. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5960.16s)]
*  But the two things that really destroyed them [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5962.36s)]
*  since the first Trump presidency to this one [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5964.5599999999995s)]
*  is Russiagate and COVID. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5967.719999999999s)]
*  They just, they were such big stories [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5970.4s)]
*  and they got them so wrong. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5972.5199999999995s)]
*  And everyone kind of knows it now. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5974.48s)]
*  Like nobody, you know, nobody believes in Russiagate anymore. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5976.4s)]
*  Nobody is sitting on, no one on television is going, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5979.599999999999s)]
*  a Russian spy is about to retake the White House. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5982.36s)]
*  But none of them are saying that. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5985.36s)]
*  None of them are saying, hey, we were wrong about all of that. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5986.4s)]
*  But if they weren't wrong, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5988.88s)]
*  why wouldn't they still be freaked out about it, you know? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5989.88s)]
*  I'm just amazed that none of them ever come on and said, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5991.88s)]
*  hey, you know what? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5994.0s)]
*  I want to apologize for wasting your fucking time. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5995.280000000001s)]
*  That's what I want to do. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5998.76s)]
*  I want to apologize that we didn't care enough [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=5999.76s)]
*  to even really look into things truly [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6003.08s)]
*  and that we wasted your time. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6006.360000000001s)]
*  That would be like a real thing to do, right? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6008.68s)]
*  Like I just, yeah, it's like, that's why I sit on here. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6011.8s)]
*  Like, are the people running this thing? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6013.88s)]
*  Do they have any human feelings? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6015.08s)]
*  Because that's why I don't see a lot. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6019.16s)]
*  It's like, you would think if you really cared [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6020.92s)]
*  about your customer base at all, right? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6023.76s)]
*  You would go and say, hey, I'm sorry, I got this wrong. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6026.4800000000005s)]
*  This was wrong. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6029.76s)]
*  Or we didn't know it was wrong, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6030.96s)]
*  but we didn't even try to do our best practices. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6033.16s)]
*  We got caught up, something, right? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6036.4400000000005s)]
*  Listen, man, I mean, they hate, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6038.92s)]
*  they fucking hate this country [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6040.72s)]
*  and they hate the people of the country. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6042.32s)]
*  And I don't like just say that to be like, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6044.08s)]
*  to make a sensational claim, but it's like, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6046.16s)]
*  if you, if my kids were hungry [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6048.84s)]
*  and I was feeding other kids, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6055.28s)]
*  like what conclusion could you draw from that [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6057.96s)]
*  other than like, you don't love your children. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6059.88s)]
*  You hate your own children [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6061.92s)]
*  because that's like your number one responsibility. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6063.84s)]
*  What do you mean you're feeding other kids [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6066.4400000000005s)]
*  while your kids are going hungry? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6068.0s)]
*  It's just too evil to even wrap your head around. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6069.84s)]
*  And that's literally what our government does. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6072.28s)]
*  Yeah, especially right now. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6074.92s)]
*  That's literally what they do, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6075.76s)]
*  is they feed other countries [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6076.6s)]
*  that don't need it, by the way, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6078.24s)]
*  not just the ones who maybe do, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6080.5199999999995s)]
*  but ones who don't need, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6081.92s)]
*  while our people are here, like starving. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6082.76s)]
*  I mean, I'm not trying to like overstate it, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6086.12s)]
*  like there's mass starvation, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6087.599999999999s)]
*  but I should say surviving a hurricane [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6089.12s)]
*  or fires or whatever. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6091.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6092.92s)]
*  I think I was thinking today, it was like, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6093.76s)]
*  hey, well, Ukraine, Zelensky, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6094.84s)]
*  can you give us back some of our money [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6096.599999999999s)]
*  so we can pay our teachers better, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6098.76s)]
*  so we can feed people who are starving in our own country, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6100.92s)]
*  so we can get homeless people off the streets, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6105.28s)]
*  we can help cure some of our mental health, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6107.24s)]
*  so we can help repair some of this fire damage [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6108.5599999999995s)]
*  for people that were uninsured [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6110.32s)]
*  or help the displaced people that are over here. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6112.68s)]
*  Just countless things. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6117.8s)]
*  I mean, I could go on and on, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6119.64s)]
*  but it's like, yeah, it just feels like [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6120.72s)]
*  we're just being money laundered a lot of times. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6123.2s)]
*  Well, even just, and to like, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6124.96s)]
*  And I know those people have problems, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6127.44s)]
*  but it's like, the perfect example for me [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6128.68s)]
*  was that Karen Bass lady with the LA fires, right? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6130.92s)]
*  I'd never heard of her before, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6134.16s)]
*  and she seems like a nice woman. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6135.28s)]
*  I bet she's a great woman. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6137.8s)]
*  But she was in Ghana, unless she was on vacation. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6139.68s)]
*  She was in Ghana, Africa, while this was happening. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6142.2s)]
*  And if she was on vacation, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6146.2s)]
*  then she should be able to do whatever she wants, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6147.56s)]
*  and she should be able to do whatever she wants anyway. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6150.36s)]
*  Just in Los Angeles, mayor freezes up, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6152.96s)]
*  this is exactly how people should be treated. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6155.24s)]
*  Do you owe citizens for being absent [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6157.08s)]
*  while their homes are burning? [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6158.8s)]
*  Do you regret cutting the fire department budget? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6159.64s)]
*  Do you think you should have been visiting Ghana [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6162.88s)]
*  while this was unfolding back home? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6164.56s)]
*  But can you look up what she and gone on vacation? [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6167.12s)]
*  That's what I need help on. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6168.8s)]
*  But she's in Ghana, but it's like, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6170.44s)]
*  why are you even in Ghana? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6171.52s)]
*  Like you're the mayor of a town. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6173.16s)]
*  And I think they did know, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6174.0s)]
*  and they knew that like big wind storms were coming, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6174.88s)]
*  and they knew that like, this is a danger, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6177.52s)]
*  you know, with wildfires and stuff. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6179.84s)]
*  So it's just, you would expect you'd be around there, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6181.72s)]
*  but it is, you know. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6185.0s)]
*  It's hard to point fingers at this point though. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6186.16s)]
*  Like, it's like, obviously things were bad. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6187.76s)]
*  They had their reservoir that was dead empty, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6189.84s)]
*  that was like, took countless millions of dollars [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6191.84s)]
*  and then held millions of gallons of water. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6195.24s)]
*  Just a lot of that, just, you know, I don't know. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6197.96s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6200.32s)]
*  What's happening out there is heartbreaking. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6201.32s)]
*  But that's the weird part. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6202.76s)]
*  It's like, why is she even, you have people, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6203.639999999999s)]
*  we have, how much do the people have to suffer [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6207.72s)]
*  or be struggling in our own country [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6210.8s)]
*  for our own country to be like here? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6213.36s)]
*  And who, how are we electing these people [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6217.12s)]
*  that aren't saying, here America, [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6220.16s)]
*  we're gonna help you first? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6222.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6224.08s)]
*  It's totally outrageous, man. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6224.92s)]
*  How is that happening? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6226.5199999999995s)]
*  I just don't understand how it's happening. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6227.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, I do think perhaps [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6228.64s)]
*  it's kind of like what you said earlier. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6230.16s)]
*  Like part of this is that we have just like acquired [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6231.5599999999995s)]
*  such a level of wealth and power as a country [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6235.2s)]
*  that it's almost like, you know, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6239.04s)]
*  the politicians who now control the tax base [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6240.48s)]
*  of the American people, they feel like gods [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6243.28s)]
*  where they're like, we can do all of this stuff. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6246.12s)]
*  I mean, I remember when, and I think this was sincere. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6247.84s)]
*  I think Joe Biden actually heard and understood [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6251.0s)]
*  this question and had a moment of being lucid. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6252.92s)]
*  But it was when the war in Gaza first broke out [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6257.08s)]
*  and some reporter asked him and was like, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6260.4s)]
*  they were like, well, you know, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6263.4400000000005s)]
*  you're all in on this war in Ukraine. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6264.36s)]
*  You've already given them hundreds of billions of dollars [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6266.2s)]
*  and now you're saying you're gonna support Israel. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6268.36s)]
*  Like, are you sure America can take on another war [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6269.92s)]
*  that we have to foot the bill for now? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6273.32s)]
*  And he goes, of course, this is the United States [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6275.32s)]
*  of America, of course we can do it. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6279.4s)]
*  Who said that Ricky's your face? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6281.84s)]
*  Joe Biden. Joe Biden, sorry. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6282.68s)]
*  Yes, and I'm sure in some way, Joe Biden like believes that, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6283.76s)]
*  you know, like Joe Biden is a child of the unipolar moment [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6288.76s)]
*  after the Soviet Union collapsed and America is dominant. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6293.2s)]
*  We can do whatever. We can do anything. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6296.8s)]
*  This is America, we can do whatever we want to. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6298.2s)]
*  It's like, you just haven't updated this script [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6300.16s)]
*  because like it's 30 years later now [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6302.52s)]
*  and no, we can't just do whatever you want to. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6304.84s)]
*  And you know, we just found out through this, you know, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6307.32s)]
*  it's like, okay, yeah, we could do whatever we want to, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6309.400000000001s)]
*  but we can't tax people enough to raise the money [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6312.360000000001s)]
*  and we can't borrow enough to get it. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6313.92s)]
*  So we have to print the money and then we deal [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6315.240000000001s)]
*  with this price inflation we've been dealing with [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6317.120000000001s)]
*  for the last few years. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6319.04s)]
*  It just like destroys working class people. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6320.04s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, I guess if you don't care about that, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6322.96s)]
*  we can do it. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6325.52s)]
*  But if you do care about that, then actually, no, we can't. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6326.52s)]
*  We don't have limitless funds. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6329.04s)]
*  And I'll just say with this, right, look, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6330.52s)]
*  you think about the United States of America, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6332.68s)]
*  the federal government, it's the biggest, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6334.92s)]
*  most powerful government in the history of the world, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6336.72s)]
*  by far, by any metric. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6338.68s)]
*  And yet, as we're doing everything, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6341.44s)]
*  as we're backing the war in Israel, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6343.32s)]
*  as we're backing Israel's war, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6345.24s)]
*  we're backing Ukraine in this war, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6346.5199999999995s)]
*  we're overthrowing regimes all around the world, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6348.639999999999s)]
*  we're talking about what the, they have a summit [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6350.879999999999s)]
*  where they talk about what the temperature's gonna be [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6353.08s)]
*  in 100 years. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6354.839999999999s)]
*  The government's trying to manage everything. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6355.759999999999s)]
*  And yet, the most basic functions of government [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6357.32s)]
*  have all gone to shit. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6360.24s)]
*  We can't win our wars, we can't balance our budgets, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6361.4s)]
*  we can't protect our borders. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6363.839999999999s)]
*  Post office sucks, dude. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6365.16s)]
*  I was in the post office like three weeks ago, right? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6366.0s)]
*  There's no, there's a home, I wanna say, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6368.28s)]
*  I don't wanna say homeless, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6371.0s)]
*  but pretty homeless guy in there, right? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6371.84s)]
*  Yelling, over and over again, right? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6372.679999999999s)]
*  Just yelling it into the fucking distance or whatever. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6375.0s)]
*  And dude, I'm second in line, right? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6378.44s)]
*  So I'm like, ugh, you know? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6381.16s)]
*  But nobody even came to help him. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6383.32s)]
*  We were in there for seven minutes, I just walked out. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6384.719999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you know? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6386.679999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, but this is, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6388.679999999999s)]
*  but that's the US postal system in a nutshell. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6389.5199999999995s)]
*  And California's a little microcosm of this, right? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6391.84s)]
*  It's the biggest state government, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6394.12s)]
*  has the biggest budget of any state government. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6395.5599999999995s)]
*  And they're trying to turn our whole country into that. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6397.16s)]
*  They're trying to do everything, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6398.0s)]
*  they're trying to say, oh, we're gonna have electric cars [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6399.28s)]
*  and we're gonna have a new power grid [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6401.84s)]
*  and we're gonna have all of this. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6403.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the most basic service, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6404.16s)]
*  like make sure your fire department has enough water [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6406.32s)]
*  in the area that is known for wildfires spreading. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6409.88s)]
*  Like the most basic thing you fail miserably at. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6413.639999999999s)]
*  And then you're gonna talk about all these pie in the sky [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6416.92s)]
*  visions of how you're gonna run the world [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6419.44s)]
*  and do all this shit. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6421.44s)]
*  And it's like, no, you're not good at this. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6422.44s)]
*  You're not doing anything right. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6425.36s)]
*  And there is something interesting about that [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6427.12s)]
*  where it's like when you try to take on way too much, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6429.52s)]
*  you end up failing at the most basic responsibility [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6432.08s)]
*  that you have. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6435.16s)]
*  Yeah, oh, always. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6436.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, it's wild. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6438.4800000000005s)]
*  And also when you position yourself as this, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6439.72s)]
*  we will handle it all. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6444.64s)]
*  You don't let other societies and cultures [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6446.68s)]
*  kind of create their own narrative [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6451.2s)]
*  and wherewithal for themselves, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6452.84s)]
*  in a weird way. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6454.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6455.72s)]
*  Oh, I think that's absolutely right. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6457.84s)]
*  Yeah, oh, I think that's true. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6459.12s)]
*  That's true like internally in America [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6460.64s)]
*  and throughout the world. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6462.84s)]
*  But even like you see like in America, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6464.8s)]
*  like the rise of the welfare state, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6468.400000000001s)]
*  like when it was really in the 60s and 70s [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6471.72s)]
*  when welfare became huge. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6474.04s)]
*  And then churches get diminished. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6476.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, oh, because that used to be [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6478.16s)]
*  what people would do if they needed help [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6480.96s)]
*  is they'd go to the local church [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6482.56s)]
*  and kind of ask them to help. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6484.12s)]
*  So it's like, oh, as you try to take care of everything, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6486.12s)]
*  you end up killing and boxing out [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6487.799999999999s)]
*  this other more organic thing [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6490.0s)]
*  where the people themselves would actually figure out [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6491.679999999999s)]
*  like who in the community needs help. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6493.599999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6495.839999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6496.679999999999s)]
*  Is pornography causing a problem in your life? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6497.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you find yourself watching porno [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6500.919999999999s)]

*  Well, you're certainly not alone. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6512.08s)]
*  Watching pornography has become so commonplace today [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6514.4s)]
*  and oftentimes men use porn to numb the pain [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6517.839999999999s)]
*  of loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and depression. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6521.32s)]
*  Shame and stigma prevent men from talking about these issues [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6525.599999999999s)]
*  and getting help for them. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6529.04s)]

*  Like, I don't know, but I also do, [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6679.12s)]
*  I don't know a lot about like medicine and the health stuff, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6681.84s)]

*  to like how corrupt the whole thing is. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6689.04s)]

*  they were like, there's nothing we can do, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6707.0s)]
*  I'd be like, hey Joe, can you get me Mel Gibson's number? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6709.28s)]
*  I wanna talk to him and his buddies about what they did. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6711.96s)]
*  I don't know, why not? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6714.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, I would be drinking fucking pool water [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6715.52s)]
*  or whatever happened, you know, whatever it needed. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6718.320000000001s)]

*  Yeah, we're supposed to start shooting a movie. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6726.08s)]
*  Me and David Spade wrote a movie [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6727.44s)]
*  and we're supposed to start shooting it last week in LA, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6728.76s)]
*  but the fires, so now it's just up in the air. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6731.0s)]
*  It's been like kind of bizarre, you know? [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6735.52s)]
*  But the weirdest thing about LA that I'm hearing is like, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6737.88s)]
*  I'll get a text from a friend [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6741.28s)]
*  or talk to a friend who's crying, you know, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6742.4s)]
*  their home is burnt down. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6743.96s)]
*  Then I'll get a call from a friend who's like, hey man, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6745.24s)]
*  do you want me to go over by your place [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6747.56s)]
*  and move your car to my apartment or whatever [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6748.8s)]
*  because in case the fire switch went. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6751.08s)]
*  And I'm like, I think I'm okay right now. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6753.72s)]
*  And I was like, what are you up to? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6755.6s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to a couple auditions today, you know? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6757.04s)]
*  And so it's just such a, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6759.56s)]
*  it's like- There's still normal shit happening [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6762.08s)]
*  in the middle of all of this, yeah. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6763.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6765.400000000001s)]
*  And that guy lives right, I mean, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6767.320000000001s)]
*  he's going along the 405, like right where the border of like, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6768.4800000000005s)]
*  where the next evacuation, it's just, it's amazing. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6771.56s)]
*  I remember when I lived there during some of the last fires, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6774.64s)]
*  you'd be driving the 405 and there would just be fire [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6777.8s)]
*  on both sides. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6781.04s)]
*  And it almost feels like it's like that, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6782.64s)]
*  what's that place in Florida [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6788.28s)]
*  with the adventure park or whatever, Six Flags. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6789.360000000001s)]
*  It almost has us, because you can't believe that it's real. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6792.12s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6795.320000000001s)]
*  And you're in Hollywood where shit is, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6796.16s)]
*  a lot of things are made and manufactured and created. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6797.6s)]
*  So you're like, well, of course this isn't real. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6800.400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's one of the things about cities [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6802.4800000000005s)]
*  that are real strange, like these modern cities [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6804.56s)]
*  where there's millions of people. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6807.28s)]
*  And I saw this a lot during COVID, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6808.88s)]
*  particularly in New York and LA, where it's like, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6810.4s)]
*  it's almost like there's nothing [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6813.08s)]
*  that people won't just adjust to, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6814.8s)]
*  because they're kind of trapped there. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6816.96s)]
*  You can't really get out. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6818.48s)]
*  You can't, you know, and so it's almost like, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6820.0s)]
*  all right, well, they're doing this now. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6823.2s)]
*  All right, I guess we got to live that, you know, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6825.08s)]
*  in New York, it's just like, all right, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6826.639999999999s)]
*  there's homeless people all over the subways. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6827.759999999999s)]
*  That guy's jerking off. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6829.36s)]
*  I guess I got to just like walk around to him [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6830.2s)]
*  and get to my work, because I got to, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6831.8s)]
*  what else am I going to do? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6833.2s)]
*  Better bring my Cumbrella with me. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6834.4s)]
*  Yeah, this is the kind of stuff it was. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6837.12s)]
*  This is very intense. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6838.4s)]
*  This must have been 2017 from Andrew Mutz. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6839.5199999999995s)]
*  Wow, that's a wild picture. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6843.28s)]
*  But bro, this same highway, same spot, Skirball Drive. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6845.0s)]
*  Keep playing that for a minute? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6849.28s)]
*  I mean, that's insane. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6850.24s)]
*  Like, how should you be able to drive this close? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6857.0s)]
*  It just... [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6859.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's- [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6863.799999999999s)]
*  There's something very bizarre about the like, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6864.64s)]
*  juxtaposition of just going about your daily life [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6866.280000000001s)]
*  while this craziness is happening right there. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6868.68s)]
*  There's people live there. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6870.52s)]
*  There's people melting. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6871.72s)]
*  Yeah, like someone right now in that car, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6872.56s)]
*  like someone's wife calls their cell, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6875.04s)]
*  and they're just like, would you mind [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6876.76s)]
*  stopping at the store on your way home? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6877.6s)]
*  Like, we're at a milk or whatever. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6879.240000000001s)]
*  They go, okay, fine, I'll stop by there. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6880.68s)]
*  And then just look out their window, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6882.160000000001s)]
*  and they're like, oh, God's angry. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6883.200000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6885.0s)]
*  Yeah, gosh. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6885.84s)]
*  Hey, Siri, play Spotify, play Firework by Katy Perry. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6886.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6891.68s)]
*  There's somebody picking up a song [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6892.52s)]
*  and then realizing, oh, maybe not right now. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6893.56s)]
*  Or some guy smoking is like, oh, it's already fucked anyway. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6895.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, what, is this really gonna be the problem? [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6898.0s)]
*  It's just people are still gonna be people. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6900.72s)]
*  What else was something else [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6905.280000000001s)]
*  that I wanted to talk to you about? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6906.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, some of the Trump's picks that you're not excited about. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6907.120000000001s)]
*  Marco Rubio at the State Department, I hate. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6912.0s)]
*  And what does the State Department do? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6914.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's a pretty big responsibility. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6916.88s)]
*  I mean, there is the State Department [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6920.88s)]
*  basically interacts with the rest of the world [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6922.76s)]
*  on behalf of the United States of America. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6925.4800000000005s)]
*  And in recent years, I mean, the State Department [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6927.6s)]
*  is involved in a lot of war making [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6931.76s)]
*  even as much as the Defense Department is. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6935.08s)]
*  And I mean, the two examples I could think of [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6938.4800000000005s)]
*  like right off the top of my head [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6942.4800000000005s)]
*  were the war in Libya, overthrowing Gaddafi, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6944.12s)]
*  was enormously led by the State Department [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6947.72s)]
*  under Hillary Clinton. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6951.76s)]
*  And in 2014, the backing the Maidan Revolution [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6953.52s)]
*  that overthrew Yanukovych in Ukraine [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6957.76s)]
*  was mostly done by the State Department. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6960.320000000001s)]
*  And so Marco Rubio is like a real Neo-Con war hawk [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6964.8s)]
*  and has been for many years. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6969.92s)]
*  What does Neo-Con mean? [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6971.04s)]
*  Well, Neo-Con at this point has kind of, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6972.360000000001s)]
*  like I'm using it in kind of the informal sense. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6974.4400000000005s)]
*  It's basically just come to mean [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6977.12s)]
*  like the war hawks who push for war after war. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6979.72s)]
*  Oh, they want war. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6985.320000000001s)]
*  Always more regime change, wars, always the next target, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6986.240000000001s)]
*  always the next thing. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6988.92s)]
*  The Neo-Con, like the self-identity, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6989.76s)]
*  Marco Rubio is not a self-described Neo-Conservative. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6992.12s)]
*  The people who actually called themselves Neo-Conservatives [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6995.320000000001s)]
*  was actually like a small group of people. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=6997.8s)]
*  The Wikipedia probably has some good information on it here. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7000.56s)]
*  But these were guys who really, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7003.56s)]
*  they really took power under George W. Bush. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7005.4800000000005s)]
*  A lot of them were in Reagan's government [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7008.68s)]
*  and in George H.W. Bush's government, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7010.4400000000005s)]
*  but they really took over when George W. Bush was in power. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7012.400000000001s)]
*  But yes, Dick Cheney, Richard Pearl, Douglas Fipe, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7016.12s)]
*  all these guys, Paul Wolfowitz. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7019.92s)]
*  Do we think that they make money off of war? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7022.200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's a fact that a lot of them work at think tanks [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7024.56s)]
*  that are funded by weapons companies. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7028.400000000001s)]
*  It's a fact that Dick Cheney was the CEO of Halliburton. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7031.52s)]
*  I mean, like these things are true. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7034.6s)]
*  So they are connected to interests [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7036.160000000001s)]
*  that make lots of money off the wars. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7037.72s)]
*  But, so a lot of them basically were, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7039.52s)]
*  they were not all, but a lot of them were Jewish. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7043.320000000001s)]
*  And a lot of, they were leftists [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7046.92s)]
*  who came over and kind of became conservatives [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7049.52s)]
*  in the second half of the 20th century. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7053.360000000001s)]
*  And they were, so they, in the 90s, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7056.0s)]
*  there were these, there was one major think tank [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7059.6s)]
*  that was called the Project for a New American Century. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7062.400000000001s)]
*  And they basically wrote out all their plans [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7065.76s)]
*  of what they wanted to do. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7068.8s)]
*  Back in the 90s, and the major thing was that they wanted, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7070.360000000001s)]
*  the Project for a New American Century, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7074.16s)]
*  the idea of it was that, right, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7075.92s)]
*  so it was a neoconservative think tank in D.C. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7078.320000000001s)]
*  And a lot of these same people, I mean, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7081.4400000000005s)]
*  Robert Kagan and William Kristol were the guys [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7083.52s)]
*  who founded it, but if you look through the name [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7087.84s)]
*  of signatures, you'll see Dick Cheney, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7089.68s)]
*  Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Pearl, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7091.92s)]
*  a lot of these guys. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7096.28s)]
*  Now they basically, this was, if you could imagine, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7097.72s)]
*  in the 90s, this is right after the Soviet Union collapses. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7101.08s)]
*  This is where, what Charles Krauttenhauer, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7104.28s)]
*  who's another neoconservative who's dead now, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7106.4400000000005s)]
*  he called the unipolar moment. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7108.68s)]
*  And what that meant was that, it was like, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7110.84s)]
*  hey, for the first time in the world, [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7112.92s)]
*  for the first time in the history of the world, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7115.04s)]
*  there is one global superpower that is more powerful [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7116.6s)]
*  than any other country that's ever existed. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7119.4400000000005s)]
*  Now that the Soviet Union's gone, it's ours. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7121.32s)]
*  So what do you wanna do? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7123.92s)]
*  Now there was this big divide amongst conservatives. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7125.04s)]
*  A lot of conservatives, what are called [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7127.48s)]
*  the paleoconservatives, it was like Pat Buchanan [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7129.84s)]
*  and guys like that, they were like, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7132.599999999999s)]
*  well, now that the Cold War's over, we can come home. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7135.32s)]
*  We were fighting this war because it was the Cold War, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7139.0s)]
*  because it was the Soviet Union, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7140.88s)]
*  but now that the Soviet Union's gone, we can disband NATO. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7141.759999999999s)]
*  We can bring- [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7144.32s)]
*  You wanna listen to some Don McLean, huh? [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7145.16s)]
*  That's right, bring, close all the bases, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7146.0s)]
*  bring everyone home, we can go back to being [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7148.04s)]
*  a normal country was the idea. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7149.6s)]
*  We don't have to rule the world. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7151.4400000000005s)]
*  We were never supposed to rule the world. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7152.400000000001s)]
*  In Pat Buchanan's idea, they were only doing this [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7154.080000000001s)]
*  because the Soviet Union existed, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7156.4800000000005s)]
*  but then there were these neoconservatives, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7158.4400000000005s)]
*  and they went, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7160.4400000000005s)]
*  Now that we control the world, we have to come up [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7162.4400000000005s)]
*  with a project for the new American century. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7166.240000000001s)]
*  We want another century. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7168.96s)]
*  The 20th century was dominated by America, [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7170.52s)]
*  and we wanna make sure the 21st century [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7173.04s)]
*  is dominated by America, and this is by, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7174.72s)]
*  I'm not exaggerating, you can go read these papers, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7176.56s)]
*  you can go Google project for a new American century, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7178.68s)]
*  and you can find all this stuff, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7181.8s)]
*  and they said their plan was, they were like, look. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7183.12s)]
*  A statement of principles they released on June 3rd, 1997. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7186.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's, if you go to the calls for regime change [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7190.52s)]
*  in Iraq, they might have a good link there [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7194.16s)]
*  that would be like the document, I'm just blanking on [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7196.96s)]
*  the name of some of the documents that they put out, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7200.12s)]
*  but they basically said, no one can mess with us, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7202.84s)]
*  and so what we need to do right now is we need to have [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7205.0s)]
*  multiple wars in the Middle East. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7208.16s)]
*  We need to have regime changes and get rid of all [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7210.08s)]
*  of the old allies of the Soviet Union, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7212.599999999999s)]
*  put in our people who we like. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7215.2s)]
*  Specifically advocating regime changes [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7217.48s)]
*  through a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7219.2s)]
*  from power in Iraq, the letter suggested that any strategy [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7221.36s)]
*  aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7224.12s)]
*  must include a determined effort to remove Hussein, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7226.48s)]
*  even if no evidence linked Iraq to the September 11th attacks. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7230.04s)]
*  Well, listen, you gotta understand, [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7233.5599999999995s)]
*  a lot of this stuff was written, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7235.08s)]
*  this is in the 90s, this was before the September 11th [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7238.200000000001s)]
*  attacks that they were talking about getting rid [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7240.200000000001s)]
*  of Saddam Hussein, they actually say there's one paper, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7241.8s)]
*  and this is what the 9-11 truthers, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7244.4400000000005s)]
*  they would love to hang onto this. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7247.200000000001s)]
*  So they said they did 9-11 because they wanted [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7248.64s)]
*  this to happen. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7250.84s)]
*  Well, there's one thing, it was in the 90s, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7251.68s)]
*  I can't remember what year it was, but you could find this, [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7254.280000000001s)]
*  but they say, basically they go through this whole thing [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7257.4400000000005s)]
*  of how we really wanna overthrow Saddam Hussein in Iraq, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7259.88s)]
*  and then we wanna fight multiple wars in the Middle East [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7262.64s)]
*  and have multiple regime changes, [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7265.04s)]
*  and they actually said in the paper, they go, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7266.92s)]
*  but it would be very challenging to get enough popular [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7269.72s)]
*  support to do something like this short of another [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7272.6s)]
*  Pearl Harbor style attack. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7275.16s)]
*  So they literally say, we really kinda need an attack [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7277.32s)]
*  on America in order to work up enough support [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7281.32s)]
*  to go fight these wars. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7284.4400000000005s)]
*  Now, that isn't proof that they did 9-11, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7285.4400000000005s)]
*  but it does certainly indicate that they know the recipe. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7290.24s)]
*  Well, at the very least when 9-11 happened, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7293.16s)]
*  they went, yes, now we got our, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7295.44s)]
*  so this is one of the worst, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7297.919999999999s)]
*  the worst thing that ended up happening was that [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7301.719999999999s)]
*  when 9-11 happens, George W. Bush is president, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7304.879999999999s)]
*  and all these motherfuckers are in power. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7307.759999999999s)]
*  So they got their opportunity, and right away after 9-11, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7310.16s)]
*  and we know this because the four-star general, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7313.5199999999995s)]
*  Wesley Clark, himself said that he was out of power [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7315.919999999999s)]
*  at the time, but he went to the Pentagon, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7318.96s)]
*  and he said that he saw plans late 2001 [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7321.2s)]
*  already drawn up for the invasion of Iraq. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7326.04s)]
*  So as soon as 9-11 happened, they were like, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7327.5199999999995s)]
*  okay, we're going to use this to go overthrow Saddam Hussein. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7330.08s)]
*  Now, all right, if I could pull it back, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7334.5199999999995s)]
*  so a few years before 9-11, in 1996. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7337.44s)]
*  And in a report just before the 2000 election [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7340.92s)]
*  that would bring Bush to power, the group predicted [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7342.88s)]
*  that the shift would come about slowly [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7345.12s)]
*  unless there were some catastrophic and catalyzing event [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7346.92s)]
*  like a new Pearl Harbor. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7349.8s)]
*  Yeah, so that's, I mean, this was their words. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7352.12s)]
*  And that's all the PNAC or whatever? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7355.2s)]
*  Yes, this is PNAC, the Project for a New American Century. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7356.240000000001s)]
*  Now, a lot of these same people involved here, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7359.8s)]
*  but there was a letter, okay, there was a letter written. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7362.400000000001s)]
*  Dark artist, son. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7364.88s)]
*  So check this one out. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7366.64s)]
*  In 1996, so just four years before this report, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7367.6s)]
*  there's a letter that was written by Richard Pearl, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7371.56s)]
*  and it was not Douglas Spife, it was Richard Pearl, [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7375.360000000001s)]
*  and Wormser, and David Wormser was the other guy who wrote it. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7379.84s)]
*  And so two of these neoconservatives. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7384.88s)]
*  And they wrote this letter, the letter is called [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7386.599999999999s)]
*  A Clean Break, A New Strategy for Securing the Realm. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7388.32s)]
*  And it's written to Benjamin Netanyahu, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7392.2s)]
*  who in 1996 was the first year that he became [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7396.04s)]
*  Prime Minister, okay? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7398.5599999999995s)]
*  And in this, basically what this was all about [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7400.2s)]
*  is that they were, the neoconservatives were saying, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7403.08s)]
*  hey, here's the new strategy, okay? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7405.36s)]
*  And the new strategy is in the early 90s, [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7407.84s)]
*  you had had these Oslo Accords, which were the, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7410.28s)]
*  the Oslo Accords, the Oslo Accord. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7413.4s)]
*  The Oslo Accord, the Oslo Accord, [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7414.24s)]
*  it was to try to get, that was supposed to help [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7416.28s)]
*  with Palestine, right? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7419.0s)]
*  Yes, so Bill Clinton is, famously, was a big deal [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7421.4s)]
*  when I was a kid, was Bill Clinton had Yasser Arafat [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7424.679999999999s)]
*  and Yitzhak Rabin, the leader of the PLO [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7428.08s)]
*  and the Prime Minister of Israel, here together to work out, [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7430.84s)]
*  we're finally, we're gonna do a two-state solution, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7434.36s)]
*  and we're gonna make this deal. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7436.88s)]
*  They brought them together, shook hands. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7438.2s)]
*  I mean, after years and years, decades of bloody fighting, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7439.8s)]
*  it seemed like an amazing step forward, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7443.280000000001s)]
*  and Israel committed to what they call a peace process. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7445.400000000001s)]
*  So eventually, essentially, they committed that they're like, [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7449.92s)]
*  you know this land that we know is not ours, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7453.280000000001s)]
*  that we've been occupying since 1967, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7455.56s)]
*  we do have to give this back to you. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7457.72s)]
*  We have to give this to you when we have to have [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7459.52s)]
*  a two-state solution of some sense. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7461.24s)]
*  We will do that, but there has to be a process [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7462.84s)]
*  that we go through, better than nothing, at least, right? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7465.0s)]
*  So this is what started. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7468.72s)]
*  Then Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister of Israel, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7470.48s)]
*  was assassinated by a right-wing Israeli, [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7473.12s)]
*  by a Netanyahu supporter, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7475.32s)]
*  assassinated him for betraying his own country [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7478.44s)]
*  and talking, but Israel was still on the hook [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7480.599999999999s)]
*  for promising to eventually give the Palestinians [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7483.16s)]
*  their own state, and the clean break memo, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7486.24s)]
*  and it's a little bit coded, but it's basically like, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7490.28s)]
*  listen, we gotta get away from that. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7493.16s)]
*  We gotta get away from this peace process, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7496.5599999999995s)]
*  and the idea of giving the Palestinians their land, [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7498.8s)]
*  this threatens Israel's stability. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7503.08s)]
*  Now, for years, okay? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7505.16s)]
*  I could see them thinking that, though, for sure. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7507.16s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7509.04s)]
*  Now, for many years, the thinking, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7510.08s)]
*  which culminated in the Oslo Accords, right, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7512.52s)]
*  the reason why there was this peace process [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7514.88s)]
*  is that the thinking, the Yitzhak Rabin thinking, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7517.04s)]
*  was that, listen, you have the Arab world [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7519.68s)]
*  who hates Israel's guts over their treatment [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7521.96s)]
*  of the Palestinian people, and so you have to make peace [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7524.96s)]
*  with the Palestinians so that you can be friendly [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7528.4s)]
*  with the surrounding Arab world so that [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7531.16s)]
*  they don't all hate you and you can coexist [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7534.5199999999995s)]
*  and you can be prosperous, right? [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7536.639999999999s)]
*  Now, the clean break is essentially a break [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7539.5199999999995s)]
*  from that line of thinking, and they go, [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7542.48s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no, you don't need to make peace [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7544.48s)]
*  with the Palestinians so that you can then [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7547.0s)]
*  make peace with the broader Arab world. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7550.28s)]
*  What you need to do is overthrow the regimes [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7552.24s)]
*  in the broader Arab world that are pissed off at you, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7555.24s)]
*  and that way you won't have to ever make peace [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7557.84s)]
*  with the Palestinians. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7559.64s)]
*  You'll never have to give them land [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7560.8s)]
*  if we could just overthrow Saddam Hussein [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7562.6s)]
*  and then overthrow the mullahs in Iran [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7564.68s)]
*  and then overthrow Bashar al-Assad in Syria, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7566.4800000000005s)]
*  and so they lay out this strategy, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7568.56s)]
*  and this is the clean break, the clean break, excuse me, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7571.04s)]
*  and these are our top neoconservatives [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7574.360000000001s)]
*  who end up in the George W. Bush administration [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7577.56s)]
*  explicitly saying that the reason they want [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7579.88s)]
*  to overthrow Saddam Hussein is because [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7582.24s)]
*  he's a problem for Israel, and when [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7584.2s)]
*  a few years later when four-star general, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7587.24s)]
*  Wesley Clark, who by the way recently [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7592.639999999999s)]
*  in a debate with my friend Scott Horton, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7595.04s)]
*  admitted that these plans went all the way back to 96 [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7597.0s)]
*  and not just 2001, which he had said before, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7599.96s)]
*  but this was the famous, I don't know [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7602.4s)]
*  if you've ever seen it before, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7603.48s)]
*  but the seven countries in five years. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7604.719999999999s)]
*  So this is Wesley Clark, you can pull up this video [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7607.759999999999s)]
*  if you want to, it's pretty interesting and has a lot. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7609.879999999999s)]
*  This is when- [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7612.96s)]
*  Are we really down a rabbit hole right now? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7613.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. We are? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7614.719999999999s)]
*  This is when Rogan told you if you want to talk about Syria, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7615.76s)]
*  I'll take you down a rabbit hole. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7619.04s)]
*  So here's the rabbit hole. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7620.92s)]
*  11, about 10 days after 9-11, I went through the Pentagon [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7622.88s)]
*  and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7626.280000000001s)]
*  and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7628.400000000001s)]
*  I went downstairs- [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7631.04s)]
*  So he's talking about the guys from PNAC. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7631.88s)]
*  Staff who used to work for me, [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7633.88s)]
*  and one of the generals called me and he said, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7635.68s)]
*  "'Sir, you gotta come in and talk to me a second.' [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7637.04s)]
*  I said, "'Well, you're too busy.' [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7640.240000000001s)]
*  He said, "'No, no,' he says, [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7641.160000000001s)]
*  "'we've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.'" [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7643.84s)]
*  This was on or about the 20th of September. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7647.36s)]
*  I said, "'We're going to war with Iraq, why?' [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7650.2s)]
*  He said, "'I don't know.' [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7654.08s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7656.04s)]
*  He said, "'I guess they don't know what else to do.'" [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7657.44s)]
*  So I said, "'Well, did they find some information [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7660.88s)]
*  "'connecting Saddam to Al-Qaeda?' [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7663.48s)]
*  He said, "'No, no,' he says, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7665.76s)]
*  "'there's nothing new that way, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7667.4s)]
*  "'they just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.'" [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7669.2s)]
*  He said, "'I guess it's like, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7672.48s)]
*  "'we don't know what to do about terrorists, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7674.24s)]
*  "'but we've got a good military [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7675.92s)]
*  "'and we can take down governments.'" [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7678.24s)]
*  And he said, "'I guess if the only two you have is a hammer, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7679.84s)]
*  "'every problem has to look like a nail.'" [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7683.44s)]
*  So I came back to see him a few weeks later, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7686.639999999999s)]
*  and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7690.12s)]
*  I said, "'Are we still going to war with Iraq?' [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7692.36s)]
*  And he said, "'Oh, it's worse than that.'" [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7694.0s)]
*  He said, he reached over on his desk, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7695.96s)]
*  he picked up a piece of paper and he said, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7697.679999999999s)]
*  "'I just, I just got this down from upstairs, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7698.88s)]
*  "'in the Secretary of Defense's office today,' and he said, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7702.24s)]
*  "'this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7704.4s)]
*  "'seven countries in five years, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7707.12s)]
*  "'starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7710.36s)]
*  "'Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.'" [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7713.12s)]
*  I said, "'Is it classified?' [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7718.0s)]
*  He said, "'Yes, sir.'" [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7719.24s)]
*  I said, I said, "'Well, don't show it to me.'" [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7721.0s)]
*  And I saw him a year or so ago and I said, [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7726.28s)]
*  "'You remember that?' He said, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7728.4800000000005s)]
*  "'Sir, I didn't show you that memo, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7729.8s)]
*  "'I didn't show it to you.'" [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7731.32s)]
*  I'm sorry, what did you say his name was? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7733.679999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to give you his name. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7735.679999999999s)]
*  So that's essentially the part to show. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7739.679999999999s)]
*  But so there's, so this was- [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7741.92s)]
*  And is he joking around, you think, or is he being serious? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7743.24s)]
*  Oh, he's being serious. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7745.4s)]
*  He was just asked about it recently and he was like, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7746.24s)]
*  oh yeah, no, this happened. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7748.08s)]
*  And he actually said in this more recent, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7749.4s)]
*  he had a one-on-one debate against Scott Horton. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7751.28s)]
*  And he, when Scott brought this up, he goes, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7754.12s)]
*  you know, it actually went back further than that. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7756.719999999999s)]
*  I had seen those plans back in 96. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7758.28s)]
*  It was the neoconservatives, right? [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7762.16s)]
*  And so the neoconservatives, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7764.2s)]
*  the ones who were in charge of the W. Bush administration, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7765.5199999999995s)]
*  or were at very high posts in that administration, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7769.16s)]
*  this was their plan. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7772.4s)]
*  And as they had mentioned in the clean break, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7773.639999999999s)]
*  explicitly for Israel, like it was to change the dynamic [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7775.48s)]
*  so that Israel, we would take out all of their enemies [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7780.16s)]
*  and put them in a situation where they never had to come [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7783.719999999999s)]
*  through on the peace process. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7786.16s)]
*  And so that's why, or at least a huge part of the reason [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7787.5599999999995s)]
*  that we're seeing the war in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7792.16s)]
*  in why we've backed Israel through all of these proxy wars, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7796.44s)]
*  it's all about that. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7801.24s)]
*  And it's, this is what, even more so than their treatment [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7803.72s)]
*  of the Palestinians, this is the thing [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7806.88s)]
*  that I'm furious at Israel about. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7808.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, what is with this pressure of lying [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7811.04s)]
*  my country's people into war after war after war [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7816.12s)]
*  is for us? [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7820.64s)]
*  Well, we always looked at then, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7821.88s)]
*  certainly I think as the, you start to get looked at [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7823.200000000001s)]
*  as the bad guy, if that's true. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7825.92s)]
*  You start to get looked at as the bad guy. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7828.0s)]
*  If you invite me to come help you, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7829.400000000001s)]
*  or if I have the bullets, and you have me come along [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7831.96s)]
*  and fire the gun, even if you give me the orders [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7835.56s)]
*  or whatever, I'm still a murderer, I'm still complicit. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7838.160000000001s)]
*  A clean break, a new strategy for securing the realm [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7843.68s)]
*  is a policy document prepared in 1996 [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7846.160000000001s)]
*  by a study group led by Richard Pearl [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7848.36s)]
*  for Benjamin Netanyahu, then Prime Minister of Israel. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7850.719999999999s)]
*  Key points, abandoning the Oslo Accords [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7853.839999999999s)]
*  and the concept of a land for peace, [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7857.5199999999995s)]
*  reestablishing the principle of preemption [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7858.839999999999s)]
*  rather than retaliation. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7860.5599999999995s)]
*  So just to be clear, because again, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7861.88s)]
*  they're saying these in kind of like, [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7863.4s)]
*  and this is how they talk about it, right? [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7865.32s)]
*  So it's all coded a little bit, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7866.92s)]
*  but abandoning Oslo means the peace process. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7868.839999999999s)]
*  The concept of land for peace, meaning like, [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7871.28s)]
*  this concept that the Palestinians deserve their land, [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7873.639999999999s)]
*  get rid of that weird concept, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7876.839999999999s)]
*  and then number two, think about how creepy that is, [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7878.92s)]
*  reestablishing the principle of preemptive [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7880.32s)]
*  rather than retaliation. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7883.36s)]
*  So in other words, we don't wait for you to attack us, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7884.8s)]
*  we just start attacking you right away [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7888.36s)]
*  because we know you're going to. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7890.4s)]
*  So essentially, giving up on the idea of a just war, [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7892.36s)]
*  like giving up on the idea of like, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7896.76s)]
*  oh, we were attacked and therefore we go to war, [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7898.08s)]
*  and instead, we'll just keep attacking you [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7900.6s)]
*  because we've decided you're going to attack us [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7903.28s)]
*  in the future. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7905.48s)]
*  But now part of you say if this is all true, right? [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7906.64s)]
*  You almost have to give Israel credit as well [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7909.400000000001s)]
*  because they're fucking gangsters. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7911.88s)]
*  That's another thing, it's like. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7914.08s)]
*  No question. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7915.160000000001s)]
*  Sometimes people are like, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7916.0s)]
*  you hear people say stuff about [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7917.320000000001s)]
*  why we're fun Israel and this and that, [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7923.84s)]
*  but then you're also like, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7925.52s)]
*  well, if like, they did it. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7927.400000000001s)]
*  If we're still playing by all these old rules of like, [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7931.240000000001s)]
*  you know, like Game of Thrones style shit [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7936.24s)]
*  and fucking, it's a dog eat dog world [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7938.599999999999s)]
*  and occupying land and all that kind of stuff, [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7942.96s)]
*  if you're still playing risk, right? [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7945.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7947.5599999999995s)]
*  But you're convincing everybody [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7948.4s)]
*  that we're not playing that way anymore, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7949.32s)]
*  but you're still playing that way, [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7951.44s)]
*  it's fucking really gangster. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7952.84s)]
*  If might makes right and the only thing that matters [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7954.84s)]
*  are the laws of conquest and who's winning is winning, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7957.679999999999s)]
*  then okay, sure, you got to give it to them that like, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7961.48s)]
*  hey, you've done it, but okay, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7964.2s)]
*  if that's your feeling, then fine, [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7966.92s)]
*  but then you don't get to cry these tears about, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7969.04s)]
*  oh, October 7th was so horrible and they did this to us [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7971.84s)]
*  because hey, you're just playing the game [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7974.88s)]
*  of might makes right and whoever can kill the other side [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7976.32s)]
*  can kill the other side. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7978.84s)]
*  And then also, okay, even if you're playing by those rules, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7980.04s)]
*  I'll respect gangster, like I respect gangsters, sure. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7983.2s)]
*  I just want to know what the rules are. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7986.2s)]
*  But right, but then at the same time, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7987.56s)]
*  you also got to understand that we live [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7991.4800000000005s)]
*  in a new world now and like all the stuff [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7992.88s)]
*  we were talking about before, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7995.36s)]
*  like people can talk about this stuff now [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7996.28s)]
*  and people can communicate and I'm sorry, [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=7998.2s)]
*  but if that's the case, then what I'm rooting for [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8000.92s)]
*  is what's best for my country. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8004.6s)]
*  And none of these wars made my country better. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8006.36s)]
*  In fact, they made it much, much worse. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8009.56s)]
*  All we got to show for the war in Iraq [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8011.8s)]
*  is thousands of our bravest young boys dead, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8013.84s)]
*  tens of thousands of them killing themselves [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8018.04s)]
*  in the wake of it, tens of thousands more [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8020.28s)]
*  injured and horribly just a shell of themselves. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8023.52s)]
*  And unsure of what their, I think, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8025.64s)]
*  and I don't know if people would want to admit this [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8028.64s)]
*  or talk about it and it may be anti-American [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8030.4400000000005s)]
*  for me to say it, but I think the definition right now [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8032.400000000001s)]
*  of being American is frayed in some ways, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8035.360000000001s)]
*  but what they were fighting, I mean, [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8040.4800000000005s)]
*  the truth of late probably closing your eyes at night [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8042.72s)]
*  and be like, well, what was I fighting for? [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8044.64s)]
*  And maybe that's messed up, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8046.64s)]
*  is that messed up with me to say that? [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8048.12s)]
*  No, I'm just speculating, I don't know. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8049.4400000000005s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8050.92s)]
*  I've heard a lot of combat vets say the same thing. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8051.76s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't think that's messed up at all. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8054.08s)]
*  Yeah, what was I fighting for? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8055.92s)]
*  I think that's right at the core of why they had, [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8056.76s)]
*  there were wars, World War II was much more bloody [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8059.36s)]
*  and vicious than any of the fighting in the terror wars [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8064.9400000000005s)]
*  and we didn't have suicide rates the way we do now. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8068.16s)]
*  And I do think a huge part of that is because [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8070.68s)]
*  those guys felt like, hey, we were liberating Europe. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8073.68s)]
*  Like, they didn't come back and feel like, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8075.96s)]
*  oh, what the fuck did I even do that for? [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8078.76s)]
*  And a lot of these guys, they come back and they're like, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8081.2s)]
*  oh, I was straight up lied to. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8083.56s)]
*  Like, I was lied to, oh, I was just a pawn in your, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8085.360000000001s)]
*  then some rich guy's game. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8088.2s)]
*  And that included me doing all types of shit to people [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8089.84s)]
*  that is very hard for any civilized person to do. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8093.52s)]
*  Oh, your conscience can't, it's a teeter totter. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8096.96s)]
*  Well, you immediately, you put yourself in a crazy situation. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8099.68s)]
*  So look, if I'm going to break into your house with a gun, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8103.18s)]
*  like once I've already made that decision [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8108.26s)]
*  that I'm going to break into your house with a gun, [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8110.14s)]
*  whatever justified me to getting to that point, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8112.860000000001s)]
*  there's now, there's a whole different dynamic [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8115.54s)]
*  where now like, okay, I could say, hey, [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8117.58s)]
*  I'm just trying to break into your house with a gun, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8119.52s)]
*  I'm going to be the good guy here. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8121.22s)]
*  But if I break into your house with a gun [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8122.780000000001s)]
*  and you run up at me with a gun, I got to shoot at you now. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8124.900000000001s)]
*  And then once that's over, and I'm back home, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8128.02s)]
*  you go like, I mean, from this guy's perspective, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8130.900000000001s)]
*  I broke into his house. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8133.18s)]
*  Who was really the aggressor here? [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8134.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, sure, I shot him because he raised his gun at me, [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8136.7s)]
*  but really I was the one who went, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8139.9s)]
*  and so this is what it's like for an invading arm. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8142.7s)]
*  And also it's not. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8144.94s)]
*  And what were we even doing there? [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8147.0599999999995s)]
*  And when you find out that a lot of the people [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8148.38s)]
*  were Saudi Arabian or something, [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8150.38s)]
*  and we didn't even deal with it, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8151.72s)]
*  it's like, what was going on? [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8152.78s)]
*  Oh, I can't even imagine. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8154.5s)]
*  And it's also like, there's something to be said for the, [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8155.58s)]
*  even if you fought a guy, let's say like, [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8159.179999999999s)]
*  back in your drinking days or something like that, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8162.26s)]
*  you got into a bar fight or something like that, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8164.66s)]
*  and you fight a guy who's around your size, you know? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8166.900000000001s)]
*  And you end up winning the fight even. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8168.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, there's still something different about that [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8171.7s)]
*  than if you just went and beat up a dude [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8174.1s)]
*  who was like a third of your size. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8176.1s)]
*  You know, like at least when we fought in World War II, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8178.3s)]
*  the Nazis were very powerful. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8180.9400000000005s)]
*  It was early in the war, [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8182.42s)]
*  it wasn't clear exactly who was gonna win. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8183.9400000000005s)]
*  But Iraq, you know, for the US military to go fight, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8187.22s)]
*  it's like, come on, dude, this is a joke. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8191.1s)]
*  We took down their government in a matter of weeks. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8193.34s)]
*  Well, remember they had those videos of them training [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8195.62s)]
*  on like jungle gyms and stuff, remember those videos? [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8197.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8200.1s)]
*  Well, I think that was like Al Qaeda or something like that. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8200.94s)]
*  But yeah, it's still like, yeah, yeah, yeah, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8202.66s)]
*  that was the monkey bars or whatever. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8204.1s)]
*  It's all just so ridiculous. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8206.18s)]
*  There's no way you're gonna go fuck those people up [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8207.58s)]
*  and not be left with a little bit of a feeling like, [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8209.78s)]
*  fuck, we beat up the weak kid. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8212.5s)]
*  What did I just do? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8213.34s)]
*  Yeah, like. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8214.26s)]
*  We beat up a weak entity. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8215.1s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8215.92s)]
*  Damn. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8216.78s)]
*  Who were some Trump picks, some other cabinet picks [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8219.9s)]
*  that you're not sure about, you feel like? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8221.66s)]
*  I know, I'm blanking on his name. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8223.58s)]
*  I know his national security advisor I really didn't like [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8225.98s)]
*  and I heard some statements from him that I didn't like. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8229.78s)]
*  Pete Hegseth was an interesting one. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8232.34s)]
*  I don't really know enough about him. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8234.64s)]
*  He's from Montana, is that that guy? [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8235.48s)]
*  Is he from Montana? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8237.14s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8238.14s)]
*  I know he was a Fox News guy for a long time. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8239.18s)]
*  I've met him a couple times. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8240.86s)]
*  Former Georgia congressman is up first, let me see. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8242.06s)]
*  What do you know about Pete Hegseth? [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8245.1s)]
*  Trump's, Hegseth 44 has developed a close rapport [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8246.26s)]
*  with Trump, a military veteran and popular conservative [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8250.26s)]
*  media personality with a large following of his own. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8254.380000000001s)]
*  Yo, he hosted like the Fox Morning Show for years. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8257.9s)]
*  Oh, I think I remember who he is now. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8261.74s)]
*  America's white sons and daughters are walking away [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8264.82s)]
*  and who can blame them? [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8267.5s)]
*  Well, I think he's talking about the military. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8268.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8269.98s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was, so I met him back in, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8271.06s)]
*  I wanna say like 2016 or something like that [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8273.220000000001s)]
*  and he was like, I think he had pretty standard [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8276.54s)]
*  Republican politics. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8279.74s)]
*  I think he, from what I've heard, he's kind of changed [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8282.42s)]
*  a bit over the years and has become much more skeptical [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8285.54s)]
*  about a lot of the wars. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8288.38s)]
*  I do remember, this is one moment I always thought [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8290.3s)]
*  was really interesting, that I saw him on one show [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8292.06s)]
*  on Fox News and this was such a not Fox News type thing [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8294.26s)]
*  for him to talk about, but he brought up [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8298.7s)]
*  and went into pretty graphic detail [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8301.3s)]
*  the epidemic of warlords raping little boys in Afghanistan [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8303.66s)]
*  and this was a major thing that a lot of the guys [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8310.380000000001s)]
*  who served in Afghanistan talk about, [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8313.380000000001s)]
*  but so when we were against the Taliban, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8315.22s)]
*  we were trying to overthrow the Taliban [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8317.9s)]
*  and a lot has been made in America and rightfully so [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8319.62s)]
*  about how the Taliban are really brutal on women's rights. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8322.94s)]
*  They don't let girls go to school, [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8326.460000000001s)]
*  they don't let women have any type of freedom. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8328.54s)]
*  However, on the other side were these tribal warlords [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8331.26s)]
*  who we were propping up and it is true that they would [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8335.62s)]
*  let the little girls go to school, [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8339.18s)]
*  but they would also rap the little boys. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8341.34s)]
*  There's like an epidemic of it and they'd bring, [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8343.86s)]
*  and so the dynamic was that our soldiers over there [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8346.34s)]
*  weren't allowed to say anything about that [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8350.26s)]
*  because they'd be like, well listen, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8352.74s)]
*  this is their customs and their way of life [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8354.1s)]
*  and so they would talk about how they could hear [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8356.42s)]
*  the screams from the little boys in their rooms and stuff [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8358.3s)]
*  and he talked about it on Fox News, [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8362.22s)]
*  which just kind of gave me the impression that I was like, [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8364.46s)]
*  oh maybe this guy is willing to kind of like tell the truth [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8366.859999999999s)]
*  in a thing where it's a little uncomfortable [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8370.22s)]
*  in an audience that isn't typically used to hearing that. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8372.699999999999s)]
*  So we'll see, I don't know though, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8376.5s)]
*  he used to really support the wars, [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8378.14s)]
*  I'm not sure where he is now. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8379.779999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8381.699999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8383.58s)]
*  There's a lot going on, huh? [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8384.619999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8386.699999999999s)]
*  Do you think that things are gonna be different this time? [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8387.62s)]
*  Do you really think that, say there is this deep state, [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8390.5s)]
*  do you think we can really get away from it [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8394.220000000001s)]
*  or is it just a lost cause? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8396.18s)]
*  And sometimes it's like, I almost just wish they, [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8398.900000000001s)]
*  my thing is I just wish they would tell me, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8400.980000000001s)]
*  I just wanna know, I don't like not knowing, [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8402.820000000002s)]
*  just tell me, I'll do the game. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8406.980000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8409.980000000001s)]
*  But tell me what the game is, tell me what the rules are. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8410.820000000002s)]
*  I understand that impulse. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8413.060000000001s)]
*  I think that, I think the best part of Trump winning [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8414.460000000001s)]
*  is that it's been the cultural effect of all of it, [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8417.82s)]
*  I think has been amazing. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8420.98s)]
*  I really think everything from November to now [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8422.9s)]
*  has just been great, it's been great. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8425.38s)]
*  There's been this big reset that we needed in America. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8426.86s)]
*  It's like the corporate media is crumbling, [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8430.34s)]
*  wokeism is receding, the insane kind of political correctness [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8432.5s)]
*  of the last few years seems to be largely defeated. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8436.9s)]
*  I think all of that is great. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8440.54s)]
*  I don't think the deep state is going anywhere [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8442.1s)]
*  in the next few years. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8444.26s)]
*  But that, I don't, like in turn, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8446.94s)]
*  I'm very optimistic long term. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8451.9s)]
*  I think that it's easy to say like, [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8454.380000000001s)]
*  we're never gonna beat this thing [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8458.380000000001s)]
*  and it's always gonna be this way. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8459.74s)]
*  They have so much power, we have so little. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8461.140000000001s)]
*  But the truth is like, communism fell, [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8463.300000000001s)]
*  slavery was abolished, [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8467.42s)]
*  America declared independence from the British monarchy. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8469.380000000001s)]
*  These things all would have seemed impossible [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8473.14s)]
*  and you could have easily said, [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8475.5s)]
*  oh, this is just gonna be here forever, [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8476.939999999999s)]
*  it's just the way of the world. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8478.66s)]
*  But it wasn't, those things are gone now. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8479.74s)]
*  And I think there's no reason why America can't have [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8482.5s)]
*  like a great kind of, a great reformation, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8486.18s)]
*  a great return to the best things about America, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8491.18s)]
*  a huge increase in liberty [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8494.26s)]
*  and decrease in awful state corruption. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8496.06s)]
*  Like I don't see any reason why that can't happen, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8499.539999999999s)]
*  especially when they don't have [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8501.42s)]
*  the propaganda machine anymore. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8502.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8503.9s)]
*  Yeah, and I think, you know, I've always thought like, [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8505.099999999999s)]
*  the sand, like it all gets remembered, right? [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8507.859999999999s)]
*  Like I think sometimes it's like, [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8510.46s)]
*  are we just, is America still suffering from [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8512.5s)]
*  like what it did to the Native Americans here? [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8516.259999999998s)]
*  And I know that's kind of wild, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8518.82s)]
*  but they had like the, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8519.939999999999s)]
*  there was a line that they put, [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8522.42s)]
*  I think it was around the Mississippi [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8523.619999999999s)]
*  called the something frontier, [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8524.46s)]
*  general frontier or something, [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8526.42s)]
*  where they're like, it was just a deal [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8527.98s)]
*  that they'd made with the Native Americans. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8529.859999999999s)]
*  And they'd be like, we promise we will never cross it. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8531.42s)]
*  This is your land. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8532.34s)]
*  It will always be your land. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8533.42s)]
*  And then within 30 years, it was like, you know, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8534.98s)]
*  and it's like, I just feel like the ground remembers. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8538.619999999999s)]
*  It's like, sometimes it's like, you're just, [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8540.619999999999s)]
*  you can't completely escape sin, I don't think, you know, [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8543.82s)]
*  or wrong. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8547.38s)]
*  I don't think you can completely escape, [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8548.779999999999s)]
*  but you can feel like you can. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8550.26s)]
*  And you might in your generation, in your life, [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8552.06s)]
*  but what you're gonna leave is something that's not, [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8554.94s)]
*  it's in the end, it all has to be even. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8557.26s)]
*  And so I just feel like, you know, [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8560.300000000001s)]
*  like the ground just keeps the score. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8563.7s)]
*  Yeah, there was something, was it to you? [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8565.98s)]
*  I can't remember, but there was something Jordan Peterson [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8568.7s)]
*  said about that, that is like how you can't get away [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8570.94s)]
*  with lying, how you can't like twist the fabric of reality [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8573.34s)]
*  and it not snap back at you. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8576.9s)]
*  And there is something to that. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8578.42s)]
*  I don't know if it's exactly perfect, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8580.06s)]
*  but like there is something to like, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8581.5s)]
*  where no matter what, you know, it's like, [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8583.42s)]
*  it's true like in a relationship, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8586.5s)]
*  if you think like, oh, maybe you're like, [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8589.300000000001s)]
*  oh, I could get away with treating my wife shitty. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8591.42s)]
*  And maybe you even can, [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8593.980000000001s)]
*  cause she'll take it for a while. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8595.1s)]
*  But like ultimately there's gonna be a price to pay for that. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8596.7s)]
*  You kind of can't get away from it. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8599.18s)]
*  Yeah, there's gonna be a Dateline episode. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8600.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, there's something. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8601.66s)]
*  And people are gonna side with her, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8602.5s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8603.900000000001s)]
*  Like it's all gonna, you can't. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8604.74s)]
*  Well, it's the same way you could stay up, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8607.380000000001s)]
*  you could stay up for three days in a row and not sleep. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8608.86s)]
*  But then like on that fourth day, [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8611.66s)]
*  you're gonna just fall out and be in deep sleep. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8613.060000000001s)]
*  Cause like you owe REM sleep, you owe it. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8615.58s)]
*  Sorry, we got a, the universe has a receipt for you [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8618.78s)]
*  of REM sleep that you owe for the last. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8621.62s)]
*  The invoice. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8623.5s)]
*  And there's something about how like, you know, [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8624.34s)]
*  it's like, okay, I could like, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8626.06s)]
*  I could go on my treadmill right now [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8627.98s)]
*  and like go run for 20 minutes and that will suck. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8630.18s)]
*  I hate those 20 minutes when I go run on my treadmill. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8633.14s)]
*  Or I could eat a big piece of cheesecake [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8635.82s)]
*  and just love the next 20 minutes and feel so good. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8637.98s)]
*  But there's gonna be a price to pay for that. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8641.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8643.7s)]
*  Like I'm gonna feel better about myself. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8644.54s)]
*  I'm gonna be in better health if I do the running. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8645.94s)]
*  There's just this weird thing with the universe [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8647.98s)]
*  where it's like, you kind of can't cheat the system. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8650.3s)]
*  And if you try to cheat the system, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8652.9s)]
*  there's always a price associated with it. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8654.58s)]
*  And now you owe that price. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8656.619999999999s)]
*  It may come later in life. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8657.859999999999s)]
*  It may, whatever, you know, like if I, [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8660.1s)]
*  if I wanna like, whatever it is, [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8661.619999999999s)]
*  if I wanna be really shitty to my wife now, [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8663.74s)]
*  it's like, maybe I think that gets me some advantage [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8666.14s)]
*  in the short term. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8669.02s)]
*  But then when my son's older and he remembers that [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8669.939999999999s)]
*  and he hates me, it's like, oh, okay. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8672.38s)]
*  There's the price for me not being good to his mom. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8674.66s)]
*  So you always like, in life in general, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8677.18s)]
*  you're always better off if you err on the side [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8679.300000000001s)]
*  of like doing the right thing [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8681.78s)]
*  so that you don't owe these prices later in life. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8683.7s)]
*  I see it all the time. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8686.34s)]
*  You see it with like old men who were like shitty drunk dads [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8687.26s)]
*  and now they're alone and they're old alcoholics. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8691.18s)]
*  And you're like, oh man, the ultimate loser here is you. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8694.1s)]
*  Like you got like a grand kid you never met, you know? [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8697.58s)]
*  And you got, it's like this, you can't cheat this game. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8700.14s)]
*  So you're better off just doing the right thing [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8703.220000000001s)]
*  and not accruing all these debts. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8705.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8707.46s)]
*  What do you think about Elon and Vivek? [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8710.14s)]
*  Do you think that that is a, [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8711.779999999999s)]
*  is that really something that's gonna have an effect [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8713.939999999999s)]
*  on things? [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8716.46s)]
*  Who do they have to answer to [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8717.699999999999s)]
*  because they're not an actual government entity? [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8719.26s)]
*  Is that correct? [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8721.82s)]
*  Yeah, so it's ridiculous, but it's also really interesting. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8722.66s)]
*  And yeah, Donald Trump just gave them a made up department [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8727.859999999999s)]
*  that they're in charge of. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8730.9s)]
*  So they're not technically a government department. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8731.82s)]
*  I think same department, but it's not a real government. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8735.26s)]
*  Department of government efficiency does, so it's not real. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8737.58s)]
*  But this, I've been saying this for a while. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8739.98s)]
*  I feel like we've entered this kind of like [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8741.26s)]
*  privatized communism, I call it. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8742.66s)]
*  Where, and you could call the, [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8744.98s)]
*  and this wouldn't maybe be considered communism, [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8746.7s)]
*  but it's privatized democracy, right? [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8748.74s)]
*  It's like, we have like, we don't have the post office [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8751.3s)]
*  anymore, we have Amazon, we have email. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8754.58s)]
*  You know, it's like, it's all been privatized, right? [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8756.94s)]
*  We don't really realize it. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8759.58s)]
*  There's still, everybody's like, the government sucks. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8760.78s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but the government's a company now. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8762.42s)]
*  It's some other company that's doing the shit [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8764.34s)]
*  that the government used to do. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8765.859999999999s)]
*  Well, right, so instead of the game, [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8767.019999999999s)]
*  because what it is is that in most people's minds, [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8768.939999999999s)]
*  they have kind of, roughly at least, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8772.22s)]
*  the idea of like capitalism versus socialism. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8774.539999999999s)]
*  And I understand, I'm speaking like with a broad brush here, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8777.5s)]
*  but like, they're like, okay, so like on one hand, [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8780.74s)]
*  you have like, the government isn't involved, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8782.82s)]
*  and it's all like competition and private companies. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8784.859999999999s)]
*  And then on the other hand, you have like, [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8787.019999999999s)]
*  the government's much more involved, [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8788.259999999998s)]
*  and the government takes over these services. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8789.66s)]
*  But really what we have isn't either of those. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8791.46s)]
*  What we have is gigantic multinational corporations [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8793.5s)]
*  that long ago bought off the government. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8797.74s)]
*  So you have this huge government that's involved, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8800.26s)]
*  but it's just working for these private interests. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8802.3s)]
*  Right, it's just wrapping paper. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8804.66s)]
*  Exactly, so like, I think that's exactly [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8806.06s)]
*  the correct way to look at it. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8809.34s)]
*  But the belief is that we still have this thing of freedom, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8811.5s)]
*  and you still do kind of have democracy in some ways, right? [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8814.78s)]
*  You could still run for an office. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8817.34s)]
*  You could still vote for someone. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8818.46s)]
*  But it's certainly feels, things feel more manufactured. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8820.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like even like, that's why I think very, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8829.46s)]
*  the uber wealthy, they don't care that much [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8831.9s)]
*  about the police and shit, [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8833.58s)]
*  because they have their own security. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8834.42s)]
*  They have, they're not fucking worried about that. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8835.5s)]
*  Well, that's the crazy thing. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8837.779999999999s)]
*  And it has really, it's been one of the things [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8839.099999999999s)]
*  that I think turned Americans against Hollywood, [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8842.099999999999s)]
*  but there's something about like, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8845.06s)]
*  kind of the like, elite progressive, you know, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8846.86s)]
*  like the people who lecture everybody else about guns [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8850.46s)]
*  and support gun control, but they have armed security. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8858.66s)]
*  The people who are offended that Donald Trump talks [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8862.06s)]
*  about building a wall, but they live in a gated community. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8864.06s)]
*  The people who, you know, go off. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8867.06s)]
*  Talk about climate change, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8867.9s)]
*  but then take private planes everywhere. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8868.9s)]
*  Dude, you could go endless, endless examples of this. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8870.82s)]
*  They talk about you, if you're upset about what they're [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8872.9s)]
*  teaching in your local public school, [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8874.9s)]
*  they say you're a bad person. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8876.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, their kids go to private school. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8877.58s)]
*  They don't have to deal with what's going on in the, [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8879.3s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8881.1s)]
*  It's like at every, they're totally insulated [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8881.94s)]
*  from the effects of the policies that they support. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8884.54s)]
*  And so, you know, anyway, to go back to the Doge thing, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8888.1s)]
*  what I think, so I had a dinner with the vague, [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8891.82s)]
*  like a couple months ago. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8895.78s)]
*  People say he's a neat man. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8897.18s)]
*  I never met him. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8898.22s)]
*  He's, I like him a lot. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8899.14s)]
*  I've gotten to know him pretty good over the last year. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8902.26s)]
*  Is he Bangladeshi or Indian guy? [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8903.66s)]
*  He's Indian, but he's American. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8905.7s)]
*  He was born here. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8907.02s)]
*  But he's, first of all, he's brilliant. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8908.46s)]
*  He's very, very successful. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8911.26s)]
*  And I will say, you know, I won't like divulge too much [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8913.58s)]
*  stuff that we said in private, [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8916.86s)]
*  but he is really big on this Doge thing. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8918.02s)]
*  And he's like, listen man, me and Elon got some tricks [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8920.94s)]
*  up our sleeves and we're gonna get some, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8923.86s)]
*  we're gonna be very effective with this. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8925.22s)]
*  Essentially, what they're gonna do [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8927.3s)]
*  is make policy recommendations. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8929.14s)]
*  And their recommendations already are gonna be massive cuts [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8931.26s)]
*  in government spending, which is, I think, [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8934.62s)]
*  the absolute correct answer. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8936.54s)]
*  And so I'm at least excited to see that, like, [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8938.54s)]
*  that's being interjected into the public. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8940.980000000001s)]
*  And him and Elon are both, I mean, these are brilliant guys. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8943.380000000001s)]
*  So maybe they could really come up with something here. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8946.1s)]
*  I agree. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8947.980000000001s)]
*  Well, it's just amazing how our country keeps going [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8948.900000000001s)]
*  more and more in debt. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8952.42s)]
*  In the end, we're gonna have a loan to some other country [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8953.7s)]
*  and that country is just gonna be like, [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8956.460000000001s)]
*  now you belong to us, right? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8957.94s)]
*  Or the whole thing has to like crash [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8959.820000000002s)]
*  and then we're setting ourselves up for failure. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8961.740000000002s)]
*  And even just now, right? [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8965.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't wanna sound too gloom and doom too. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8966.94s)]
*  But even just now, it's like, forget it. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8968.980000000001s)]
*  Like, the debt is a major problem [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8970.900000000001s)]
*  and we're going off like the fiscal cliff [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8972.42s)]
*  and we're not gonna be able to keep this up. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8974.34s)]
*  But even just right now, the reason we're racking up [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8975.86s)]
*  so much debt is because the government spends [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8978.580000000002s)]
*  so much money every year. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8980.34s)]
*  And this is, that is the corruption. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8981.62s)]
*  It's not like a symptom of the corruption. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8983.820000000002s)]
*  It's like, you got an organization in Washington, D.C. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8985.820000000002s)]
*  that by force extracts six trillion dollars of wealth [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8988.34s)]
*  away from the American people every year [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8992.42s)]
*  and then give it out to their connected friends. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8994.54s)]
*  It's like the most, like. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8997.22s)]
*  It's fucking, it's laundering. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=8998.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's the most criminal shit in the world, [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9001.26s)]
*  you could imagine. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9003.66s)]
*  The only reason why we don't think of it as criminal [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9004.5s)]
*  is because it's so big and successful. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9006.22s)]
*  But if anyone did it on a small level, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9008.58s)]
*  you'd be like, oh, I know what that is. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9010.22s)]
*  That's a gang, that's a crime. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9011.66s)]
*  Like that's, and even, and like I said before, [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9013.5s)]
*  the other big thing is that in order to have [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9017.02s)]
*  such a big government, what you need is, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9019.98s)]
*  because you can never tax people enough [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9023.26s)]
*  to pay for all this shit, and they can't even borrow [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9024.1s)]
*  enough money to pay for all of it, [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9025.86s)]
*  so they have to just constantly be printing money. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9027.22s)]
*  And that sends us into living in an inflationary world [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9029.460000000001s)]
*  where everything's constantly getting more expensive [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9032.58s)]
*  and the value of your dollar is constantly going down. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9034.9s)]
*  And again, this is, if you're rich, it's fine. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9037.66s)]
*  If you own stuff, you can kind of protect yourself from it [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9041.94s)]
*  because the value of your assets goes up too. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9044.66s)]
*  But for middle class and working class [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9048.06s)]
*  and people on a fixed income, [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9049.98s)]
*  this just destroys them, absolutely destroys them. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9051.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, the price inflation over the last few years [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9054.7s)]
*  has just like, I don't even know, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9057.38s)]
*  the Federal Reserve keeps numbers on this stuff, [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9059.78s)]
*  but I don't know if they've done it over the recent wave [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9061.94s)]
*  of price inflation, but how many marriages [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9064.22s)]
*  get destroyed by this? [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9066.38s)]
*  People commit side over stuff like this. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9068.78s)]
*  I mean, it's a- [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9070.82s)]
*  They don't care, and they don't think about that. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9071.66s)]
*  It's the same way they didn't think whenever they, [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9072.5s)]
*  they don't care. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9075.54s)]
*  It's the same way they didn't care that every AA room [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9077.74s)]
*  and meeting was gonna shut down when they started COVID, [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9081.66s)]
*  or whenever COVID started. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9085.82s)]
*  It's the same way that they didn't care about [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9087.300000000001s)]
*  the pill epidemic that's taken hundreds of thousands, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9089.54s)]
*  600,000 lives, and not to mention the ripple effect [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9094.9s)]
*  of those deaths that have broken the hearts of mothers [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9099.220000000001s)]
*  and children and wives and husbands. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9102.58s)]
*  They don't care. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9105.300000000001s)]
*  I just, that's what it feels like anymore. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9106.140000000001s)]
*  It feels like they don't fucking care. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9108.54s)]
*  So what can I do now? [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9110.34s)]
*  Well, it's also- [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9111.9s)]
*  But then also, I also have to remember [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9112.74s)]
*  that throughout history, people have lived [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9114.06s)]
*  in this exact same space, feeling like their government [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9117.5s)]
*  did not care about them. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9120.3s)]
*  And worse, I mean, in much worse spaces. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9121.82s)]
*  And much worse, you're right. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9123.380000000001s)]
*  So that's why I think other countries are like, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9124.34s)]
*  well, this is, hey, welcome. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9125.78s)]
*  Welcome to what it's really like to exist. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9127.86s)]
*  Yeah, okay, fine, but at the same time, that doesn't mean- [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9130.98s)]
*  But we should have better. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9133.7s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9134.98s)]
*  Look, I mean, so there's lessons to take [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9135.82s)]
*  from all of that stuff, right? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9137.62s)]
*  In the 20th century, we had two world wars. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9139.42s)]
*  Tens of millions of people just got caught up in this [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9143.820000000002s)]
*  for no fault of their own at all. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9146.7s)]
*  And I'm not even talking about just [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9148.74s)]
*  like the standard textbook history. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9150.02s)]
*  There were people who just happened to be Germans. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9153.060000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9155.26s)]
*  They weren't, they didn't necessarily even support [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9156.1s)]
*  the Nazis or anything like that. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9158.58s)]
*  There were ethnic Germans. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9160.26s)]
*  Darrell Cooper just put out the prologue [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9162.1s)]
*  for his new World War II series, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9163.78s)]
*  and the first one is so good. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9165.34s)]
*  But all talking about, and this is like [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9167.54s)]
*  a forgotten chapter of history, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9169.02s)]
*  but after World War II, ethnic Germans, [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9170.5s)]
*  not even living in Germany, weren't even living [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9173.14s)]
*  under the Third Reich, just in Eastern Europe, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9174.94s)]
*  just got totally slaughtered by the millions, [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9177.62s)]
*  wrecked and beaten and ethnically cleansed. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9181.26s)]
*  This is obvious. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9184.9s)]
*  I only lead with that because it's like the one [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9186.18s)]
*  that people don't know as much about. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9188.22s)]
*  But obviously, there were Jews who just happened [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9189.62s)]
*  to live in Germany or in Eastern Europe. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9191.94s)]
*  There were Russians and Poles and just all types of people [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9193.86s)]
*  who just got destroyed. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9196.74s)]
*  So no, okay, people have had it much worse. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9198.46s)]
*  But at the same time, I do think it's your point being, [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9200.539999999999s)]
*  especially when you see the corporate media [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9204.42s)]
*  and you see the way they freak out over January 6th, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9206.78s)]
*  the way they freak out over whatever it would be, [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9211.98s)]
*  the latest thing Donald Trump says, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9216.5s)]
*  and then you sit there and you go, [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9218.26s)]
*  yeah, you know, 100,000 people die of overdoses [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9219.1s)]
*  in this country every year. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9223.58s)]
*  And by the way, calling them overdoses [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9225.740000000002s)]
*  is not entirely accurate. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9228.54s)]
*  Poisoning is a good term. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9230.7s)]
*  Poisoning is more, I mean, when you're talking [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9232.1s)]
*  about the fentanyl thing, I mean, at least for me, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9233.54s)]
*  when my whole life, when I thought of what the word [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9236.140000000001s)]
*  overdose meant, what overdose meant to me [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9240.1s)]
*  was essentially like you become such a drug addict [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9243.460000000001s)]
*  that you build up such a tolerance [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9247.900000000001s)]
*  that you gotta take so much drugs in order to get high [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9249.820000000002s)]
*  that eventually you have to take so much [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9252.94s)]
*  that it kills you before you even get to feel good. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9254.94s)]
*  But that's not the same thing as someone thinking [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9258.34s)]
*  they're taking a Percocet and it actually has fentanyl in it [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9260.18s)]
*  and then they just kill themselves. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9263.7s)]
*  That's not exactly an overdose, right? [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9264.980000000001s)]
*  No, it's a poisoning. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9266.78s)]
*  Yeah, you got poisoned to death. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9267.66s)]
*  And that company didn't even face any reminiscences. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9268.5s)]
*  They're still allowed to come into America. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9270.66s)]
*  I know, and this isn't even something that comes up. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9272.26s)]
*  People care, but they can't do anything. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9274.42s)]
*  Right, well, what I just say is like, it's just like, [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9276.78s)]
*  say like, okay, I understand that some people [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9279.140000000001s)]
*  broke some windows of the Capitol Building on January 6th [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9281.34s)]
*  and I understand that AOC was real scared [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9284.1s)]
*  for 20 minutes or whatever, okay, [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9286.18s)]
*  but like that, the amount of coverage and outrage [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9288.34s)]
*  that that gets compared to 100,000 of your fellow Americans [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9291.86s)]
*  being poisoned to death every year. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9295.140000000001s)]
*  And it's not like it's a one to one, it's a 100 to zero. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9296.94s)]
*  Like this just doesn't even come up. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9300.66s)]
*  It's not even like a, you know. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9302.06s)]
*  Until Hollywood is like, oh, we'll make a series about it. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9303.460000000001s)]
*  So we'll make, now we'll make money off of it. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9306.26s)]
*  I'll say this, dude, and this is like, [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9309.380000000001s)]
*  I'm mildly embarrassed to admit this, [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9310.66s)]
*  but as somebody who's like obsessed with this shit [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9313.5s)]
*  and talks about politics all the time, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9315.9s)]
*  it wasn't until Bobby Kennedy ran for president [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9317.619999999999s)]
*  and he goes, you know, America leads the world [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9320.099999999999s)]
*  in chronic illness, and I remember being like, [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9323.419999999998s)]
*  is that right? [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9325.859999999999s)]
*  Do we lead the, like I didn't even know [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9327.539999999999s)]
*  that we led the world in chronic illness. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9329.46s)]
*  And it's like, just, it took Bobby, [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9331.779999999999s)]
*  why has no one else who's run for president [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9333.339999999998s)]
*  ever brought this up? [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9335.06s)]
*  How is this not a thing that we all talk about all the time? [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9336.339999999998s)]
*  Well, Bernie Sanders talks about a good bit of it a lot. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9339.019999999999s)]
*  Well, he talks about, Bernie Sanders talks about [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9341.14s)]
*  the health insurance stuff. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9342.94s)]
*  He talks about the Medicare for all stuff, [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9344.62s)]
*  but I never really heard anyone talking about [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9346.380000000001s)]
*  what Bobby's talking about in terms of like, [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9348.34s)]
*  why are we so sick? [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9350.380000000001s)]
*  Like, forget whether you think we need universal healthcare [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9352.02s)]
*  or private healthcare or whatever, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9354.26s)]
*  like whatever health insurance you're talking about. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9355.54s)]
*  I'm saying like, why are we so sick [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9357.54s)]
*  as a people to begin with? [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9360.140000000001s)]
*  And that's more about like, what we're eating, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9361.74s)]
*  what the, you know, like what we're consuming. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9364.18s)]
*  But okay, then say if there's these forces [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9367.460000000001s)]
*  and they see like, okay, we can poison them this much [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9369.380000000001s)]
*  and we can make the money here and this. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9371.38s)]
*  But why, what do they get out of all of it? [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9373.099999999999s)]
*  Or do you think there's just such a level of wealth [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9376.42s)]
*  and control that after generation and generation, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9378.42s)]
*  you just start to see it as a game almost? [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9381.22s)]
*  Like, that's the part I can't understand [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9383.699999999999s)]
*  because I couldn't understand, like at a certain point, [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9386.3s)]
*  you start to do well and then you wanna help other people. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9389.3s)]
*  Like, whether it's like, build a facility for drug people [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9392.179999999998s)]
*  or whatever it is, right? [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9395.58s)]
*  Like, get clean water, like do something pot, like, [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9396.66s)]
*  I can't understand getting to the part [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9399.86s)]
*  where you start to see people just as nothing more [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9401.58s)]
*  than some, than basically ghosts [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9404.94s)]
*  to launder your money through, really. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9409.94s)]
*  Well, I do think that when you get, [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9412.22s)]
*  well, obviously like, so- [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9413.98s)]
*  It's control, a lot of it was controlled. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9415.22s)]
*  A lot of it's control, so much of it is business. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9416.699999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9419.619999999999s)]
*  Like, so much of it is just like, [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9420.46s)]
*  ah, there are these companies [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9421.42s)]
*  that make tons of money off this shit. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9422.26s)]
*  But I do think that there's like a mentality [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9424.3s)]
*  that gets developed when you get to a certain level [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9427.18s)]
*  of power where like, you know, the same thing like with, [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9430.380000000001s)]
*  you know, like if there's companies, [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9434.06s)]
*  like if there's a little mom and pop store, [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9435.300000000001s)]
*  they kind of know everyone in the area [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9437.300000000001s)]
*  and they kind of care a little bit more, [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9439.02s)]
*  they're more connected to the community. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9440.58s)]
*  When you're talking about like a giant corporation, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9441.86s)]
*  you're just kind of like a cog in a machine to them. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9443.460000000001s)]
*  Like, they're just, but when you get to like, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9446.54s)]
*  the top, top level of power, [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9448.02s)]
*  and I think they've been pretty explicit about this. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9450.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, Henry Kissinger pretty much like admitted this [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9452.06s)]
*  in his own words, that people are pawns on a chessboard. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9454.580000000002s)]
*  And that's the way they look at it. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9457.740000000002s)]
*  It's not, they don't believe that they are like, [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9459.26s)]
*  they're almost above what me and you would consider morality. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9462.140000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9466.26s)]
*  It's like, they're at this super high level [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9467.1s)]
*  where it's like, listen, we're moving these pawns over here [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9469.5s)]
*  so that the Soviet Union collapses. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9473.220000000001s)]
*  And oh yeah, it sure does suck [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9475.5s)]
*  if you happen to be a Vietnamese person, [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9477.34s)]
*  but we're at war with the Soviet Union. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9479.660000000002s)]
*  And so you're just pawns on a chessboard. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9481.740000000002s)]
*  And that's what they're doing with Ukraine right now. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9483.7s)]
*  What they're doing with Ukraine right now [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9485.78s)]
*  is just using them as cannon fodder to hurt Russia. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9487.06s)]
*  And they pose as the ones who care about Ukrainians so much, [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9492.34s)]
*  but really they just led them down, [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9495.42s)]
*  as John Mearsheimer said, the Primrose path. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9497.22s)]
*  They went, go ahead, fight this big bully [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9499.7s)]
*  who could totally fuck you up. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9501.9s)]
*  Go ahead, fight him. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9503.3s)]
*  We got your back. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9504.5s)]
*  And by Ukraine? [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9506.22s)]
*  Yeah, to Ukraine. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9507.06s)]
*  And by we got your back, not like the military [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9507.9s)]
*  is gonna come in and actually like back you up, [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9509.46s)]
*  but we'll just give you a weapon [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9511.7s)]
*  so you can keep going out there and dying. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9512.74s)]
*  But it'll hurt the Russians also. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9514.619999999999s)]
*  And that's the goal. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9516.42s)]
*  And you're like, it's a real sickness [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9518.34s)]
*  if you start looking at human beings that way. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9520.34s)]
*  Yeah, what did Kissinger say? [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9522.58s)]
*  Bring that back up. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9523.539999999999s)]
*  He said, military men are just dumb, [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9525.26s)]
*  stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9527.5s)]
*  Is that real? [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9530.42s)]
*  Oh, geez. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9531.26s)]
*  I knew he had some quotes about that, [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9532.94s)]
*  but that one even surprised me. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9534.3s)]
*  I was like, oh, geez. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9535.78s)]
*  Where was he from, Kissinger? [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9536.619999999999s)]
*  Where was he originally from? [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9539.539999999999s)]
*  Eastern Europe? [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9541.14s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9543.14s)]
*  Henry Kissinger. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9543.98s)]
*  Bring him up, get to there. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9545.3s)]
*  He was of course the Secretary of State [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9546.38s)]
*  under Richard Nixon. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9547.66s)]
*  Scroll up. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9549.699999999999s)]
*  Born in Germany, okay. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9552.539999999999s)]
*  Born in Germany, a Jewish refugee fleeing Nazi persecution. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9553.78s)]
*  Maybe that's what made him believe that, huh? [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9558.98s)]
*  That probably was what led to his belief, huh? [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9561.02s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I'm sure that had a profound influence [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9562.619999999999s)]
*  on who he was, yeah. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9566.26s)]
*  Man, it's heartbreaking. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9567.619999999999s)]
*  Tended Harvard University, very smart guy. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9569.82s)]

*  even when you talk about the Nazi connection for his views, [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9576.94s)]
*  but a lot of that is true with the Israel stuff too, [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9580.22s)]
*  that it's like, you know, a lot of this, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9582.7s)]
*  it's like people who went through a lot of the shit [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9584.14s)]
*  that they went through got it in their minds [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9588.02s)]
*  that you do whatever you have to do [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9590.22s)]

*  And some of it like, yeah, maybe it's easy for me [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9622.06s)]
*  to just sit here and say things from my home that has been [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9624.619999999999s)]
*  that has heat in it, you know? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9630.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know, I don't... [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9631.38s)]

*  Is that there's like, life is that there's like [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9633.66s)]
*  constantly tragedy all around us, [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9635.58s)]
*  but then there's beauty all around us also. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9638.099999999999s)]
*  And then if you can kind of like reconcile yourself [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9640.619999999999s)]
*  with the tragedy and accept that, [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9643.9s)]
*  you can really enjoy the beauty in life. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9645.779999999999s)]
*  That's the best we could try to do. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9648.779999999999s)]
*  But yes, you're right, we speak from a position, [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9652.06s)]
*  as the lefties would say, from a position of privilege, [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9654.3s)]
*  and we're able to... [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9657.099999999999s)]
*  But at the same point, like my thing is kind of like, [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9658.62s)]
*  if you are in that position and we're fortunate enough [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9661.02s)]
*  to like be in a heated studio [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9663.42s)]
*  and in a comfortable environment or whatever, [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9665.86s)]
*  then like, okay, so then we should try our best [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9668.660000000002s)]
*  to kind of rise up above, like what I was saying before, [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9673.02s)]
*  we're like, hey, if you're an Israeli Jew [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9676.380000000001s)]
*  and one of your family members were killed on October 7th, [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9678.5s)]

*  But from our position of not being [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9689.140000000001s)]
*  in either of those positions, [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9690.980000000001s)]
*  we should at least be able to go like, [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9692.460000000001s)]
*  okay, let's try to calm things down. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9694.380000000001s)]
*  Let's try to like push for peace. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9697.02s)]
*  Let's try to go like, [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9698.54s)]
*  we understand how both of you could feel that way, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9699.380000000001s)]
*  but understand where the other one feels [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9701.58s)]
*  the same way you do. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9703.34s)]
*  So like, at least sometimes there's an advantage [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9704.220000000001s)]
*  to be like on a perch in a little bit of a better situation [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9707.060000000001s)]
*  where you can kind of see things and go, [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9710.02s)]
*  okay, let me at least call balls and strikes on this [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9711.5s)]
*  and not just kind of flame more conflict, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9714.460000000001s)]
*  which is what people on the ground are doing. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9717.18s)]

*  I think I just, if I feel like something's the underdog, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9722.86s)]
*  then I'd rather err on that side for me. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9725.14s)]
*  It's like, somebody's like, oh, you got mad. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9728.06s)]

*  Well, in what sense? [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9754.539999999999s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9755.46s)]
*  Because America just starts to seem like this place [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9756.3s)]
*  where everybody can just commit for their other country [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9757.539999999999s)]
*  if they want to. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9760.1s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that's one of the things [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9760.92s)]

*  the whole America first thing, [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9767.14s)]
*  like this idea that, hey, like, [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9768.58s)]
*  we should be for our country. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9770.02s)]
*  I think that there was, particularly after World War II, [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9772.22s)]
*  which is really when you had the rise of like, [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9777.179999999998s)]
*  the current world order. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9779.42s)]
*  I mean, obviously the Soviet Union's were part of it [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9782.14s)]
*  and then they fell, [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9783.74s)]
*  but the kind of American dominance [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9784.58s)]
*  started really after World War II. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9787.3s)]
*  I mean, we won and we dropped the nukes. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9789.179999999998s)]
*  And the situation was that all of the industrialized world [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9791.06s)]
*  had been destroyed, except for us. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9794.619999999999s)]
*  The war touched everyone, basically, [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9797.179999999998s)]
*  every power except us. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9799.3s)]
*  And we lost some men there, [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9801.02s)]
*  but we still came out with the homeland. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9802.26s)]
*  We had a big head start. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9804.220000000001s)]
*  Yes, well, that's right. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9805.220000000001s)]
*  We got in late and we developed the nukes. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9806.34s)]
*  And so, and we used nukes. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9808.5s)]
*  And so it was like, oh, they have this new weapon [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9810.7s)]
*  that nobody else has. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9812.34s)]
*  And so after that, the- [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9813.460000000001s)]
*  Which was sick, by the way, too. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9815.98s)]
*  Horrific. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9817.42s)]
*  Oh, just like, I mean, totally inexcusable and disgusting. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9818.54s)]
*  Which almost makes you wonder, [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9822.220000000001s)]
*  do we have just our judgment day coming? [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9823.060000000001s)]
*  Well, or- Not us, we didn't do it. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9825.54s)]
*  Well, you would hope. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9827.62s)]
*  You would hope that the universe can pick out [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9828.78s)]
*  who was involved, at least to some degree, and who wasn't. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9831.359999999999s)]
*  But in some ways, there's this great old [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9833.199999999999s)]
*  John Quincy Adams quote, which I'll probably butcher, [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9836.439999999999s)]
*  but maybe you'll pull up. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9839.32s)]
*  But it's like, it was something like, [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9840.32s)]
*  if we go around the world looking for monsters to destroy, [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9842.08s)]
*  we will become the diketris of the world, [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9845.039999999999s)]
*  but we will lose our own soul. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9847.0s)]
*  And that was, which is pretty profound [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9849.08s)]
*  that he said this back in the early 1800s, I believe. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9851.359999999999s)]
*  What does the diketris mean? [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9854.16s)]
*  Like dictator, the female version of dictator. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9855.599999999999s)]
*  So like, we'll rule the world, [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9858.8s)]
*  but you'll lose your own soul, or something like that. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9861.199999999999s)]
*  I might be butchering this quote, [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9864.039999999999s)]
*  but that's essentially the gist of it. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9865.119999999999s)]
*  The point was that you're like, oh, you go dominate the world, [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9867.88s)]
*  but you lose your own soul. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9870.519999999999s)]
*  Like, you take over everything else, [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9872.039999999999s)]
*  but you lose the essence of who you are. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9874.8s)]
*  Well, it's the same thing as being, I think, [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9876.96s)]
*  somebody like Jim Carrey or some type of a celebrity. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9880.279999999999s)]
*  You put so much of you out there [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9882.4s)]
*  that you are all over, [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9884.72s)]
*  but you don't know who you are anymore. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9886.48s)]
*  Right, and there's a weird like, [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9887.88s)]
*  there's a weird equation to that. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9891.839999999998s)]
*  But after World War II, America kind of took on [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9893.279999999999s)]
*  the mantle of being like, okay, [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9896.8s)]
*  well, we're gonna rebuild Europe. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9898.199999999999s)]
*  And there were arguments for why we should. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9900.519999999999s)]
*  We're gonna be the defense of Europe. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9902.8s)]
*  We formed NATO so that we could protect Western Europe [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9905.839999999998s)]
*  because they weren't in a position to do it for themselves. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9908.72s)]
*  And it's almost like we became then [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9910.88s)]
*  the country that was always in the business of welfare [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9913.72s)]
*  for other countries. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9916.6s)]
*  And I think what happened with Donald Trump, [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9918.28s)]
*  where a lot of people were, [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9920.720000000001s)]
*  is that particularly after the years of the terror wars [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9921.880000000001s)]
*  that were such disasters, [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9924.52s)]
*  is that people started kind of reassess that [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9926.2s)]
*  and be like, well, look, [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9928.48s)]
*  we're not in a situation right now where Europe is destroyed [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9929.76s)]
*  and you know what I mean, [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9933.6s)]
*  like we're the only ones unscathed by this war. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9934.76s)]
*  Europe is rich, they're fine. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9937.92s)]
*  A lot of these other countries are like, they're stable. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9940.48s)]
*  And we're $36 trillion in debt. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9944.44s)]
*  Our dollar is getting weaker. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9947.52s)]
*  Our culture is like totally pitted against each other. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9949.6s)]
*  Things feel like they're kind of falling apart here. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9952.64s)]
*  And so it's just, it's a different proposition to go like, [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9954.84s)]
*  hey, my family is taken care of and doing really good [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9958.72s)]
*  and I'm gonna help out this other family [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9962.96s)]
*  who's like friends of ours. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9964.84s)]
*  That's a totally different proposition than like [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9966.119999999999s)]
*  when my family's falling apart and are broke and hungry [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9968.359999999999s)]
*  helping out somebody else. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9971.52s)]
*  That's just a different thing. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9973.519999999999s)]
*  And so I do think like there should, [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9974.72s)]
*  it's healthy and normal and natural [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9977.0s)]
*  that there should be a movement in America [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9980.08s)]
*  that's concerned with America. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9982.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, well you have people too [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9983.88s)]
*  who lost their grandfathers, who lost their siblings, [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9985.039999999999s)]
*  who lost their great grandfathers too, [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9988.759999999998s)]
*  helping liberate other groups and helping around the world, [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9991.48s)]
*  helping be those military presence around the world [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9995.4s)]
*  and who served and they thought that that meant something, [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=9998.8s)]
*  that there was some value, that it meant something, [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10001.92s)]
*  that the American flag hadn't just been pitted by, [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10004.28s)]
*  hadn't just been divided as if it was a conservative emblem. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10009.24s)]
*  That's crazy to think that somebody got fucking [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10012.56s)]
*  half of America to think that the American flag [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10015.2s)]
*  stands for like rednecks or something. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10018.16s)]
*  Think about that shit. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10020.52s)]
*  People don't wanna think about that. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10021.72s)]
*  People don't wanna think that, oh, that's true, [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10023.12s)]
*  there's a little part of me that took that bait. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10025.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10029.56s)]
*  Who has put the bait in front of you? [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10031.199999999999s)]
*  And then see the hook, man, there's a fucking hook. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10032.76s)]
*  Yeah, well like if loving America is right wing [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10036.039999999999s)]
*  and free speech is right wing and working out is right wing, [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10038.48s)]
*  so shouldn't we all be right wing then? [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10043.8s)]
*  What are we even talking about now? [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10045.44s)]
*  And then I think that that's all changed. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10047.56s)]
*  It's like you have Democrats that are Republicans now, [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10049.199999999999s)]
*  you have people that don't know, [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10051.199999999999s)]
*  you have a ton of people that wanna be libertarians [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10052.16s)]
*  that don't know what it is. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10054.279999999999s)]
*  And so that's one of the reasons why [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10055.84s)]
*  I think we wanted to learn from you what it is. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10057.720000000001s)]
*  What does a libertarian idea of healthcare look like? [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10060.68s)]
*  What does that look like? [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10063.16s)]
*  Well, look, I mean the libertarian idea [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10064.2s)]
*  with all of this stuff is to like actually get [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10066.08s)]
*  the government out of the way and let there be a real market. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10068.52s)]
*  I mean so much of the problem in healthcare in general [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10071.4s)]
*  is that it's just, it's not a real market [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10074.44s)]
*  like any other market. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10076.44s)]
*  The prices, good luck even finding out [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10077.84s)]
*  what the prices are. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10081.44s)]
*  It's the only business you could walk into [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10082.84s)]
*  where no one in the room knows what the price is. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10084.9s)]
*  And because like, I remember, [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10088.24s)]
*  there was one time that my, it was like years ago, [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10091.68s)]
*  I think before we got married, [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10095.0s)]
*  but my wife was like, she had a month [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10096.439999999999s)]
*  where she had a lapse in her insurance. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10098.84s)]
*  And so she had like one month without insurance [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10100.84s)]
*  before she got on mine or something. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10103.16s)]
*  And she had blood work done the month [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10105.279999999999s)]
*  that she didn't have insurance. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10108.14s)]
*  So we get some bill, you know it was like a bill. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10109.359999999999s)]
*  You mean blood work or whatever? [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10111.199999999999s)]
*  Oh, like okay. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10112.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like taking her blood. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10113.039999999999s)]
*  And so we get a bill for like 1400 bucks. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10114.76s)]
*  And my wife calls them and she's like, oh yeah. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10117.48s)]
*  I think what happened was she went to the doctor [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10120.44s)]
*  when she still had the insurance, [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10122.68s)]
*  but then they sent it to the lab [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10124.0s)]
*  after her insurance expired before the new one kicked in. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10125.72s)]
*  So she's stuck with this bill or whatever. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10128.880000000001s)]
*  And she goes, oh so this like fell like in my lap [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10130.880000000001s)]
*  so like I don't have insurance. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10134.56s)]
*  And they go, oh you're uninsured? [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10135.84s)]
*  And she was like, yeah. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10137.44s)]
*  And they go, oh we'll knock 70% off. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10138.28s)]
*  Wow. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10139.92s)]
*  Just like that. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10140.76s)]
*  Now party, I remember in the moment being kind of like, [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10141.58s)]
*  this is many years ago and I was, [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10144.28s)]
*  I'm doing better now than I was then. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10146.28s)]
*  But at the time I was like, oh sweet. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10147.54s)]
*  We just knocked 70% off. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10149.220000000001s)]
*  But then as soon as I'm like sweet, [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10150.52s)]
*  I'm like wait a minute. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10151.640000000001s)]
*  That's all, the prices are inflated by 70% [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10152.84s)]
*  for everybody else who has insurance. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10156.28s)]
*  It's like this constant, [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10160.36s)]
*  and it's all because of these crazy over regulation, [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10161.240000000002s)]
*  over government involvement. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10164.6s)]
*  It's just literally things work better [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10166.04s)]
*  when you have a free market and there's real competition. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10168.94s)]
*  So that's the libertarian answer to almost everything. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10171.72s)]
*  Is like deregulate it, let there be real competition, [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10175.32s)]
*  let it be privatized, but if these private companies fail, [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10178.24s)]
*  let them go out of business. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10181.56s)]
*  Don't come in and bail them out. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10182.88s)]
*  Let them actually have to compete [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10184.199999999999s)]
*  for who can provide a better service to their customers. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10186.039999999999s)]
*  That's when we get good things. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10189.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's another part in that book [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10191.96s)]
*  where Marty McCarrey, that doctor who's just, [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10193.76s)]
*  who got, is gonna be appointed by Trump. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10196.8s)]
*  He talked about how, yeah, there was a guy [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10199.720000000001s)]
*  whose father had a stroke and they kept him in the hospital [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10204.24s)]
*  and they could do a procedure, [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10207.4s)]
*  and they're like it's like $150,000. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10209.12s)]
*  And the guy's like what the fuck, we can't do that. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10211.64s)]
*  And they just, they kept kind of holding him off, [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10213.28s)]
*  and eventually they're like yeah, it's $15,000. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10217.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10221.08s)]
*  Just like, just like. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10221.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's just insane. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10222.76s)]
*  Every couple of days they would just call him back, [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10223.76s)]
*  like we'll do it now, we'll do it now. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10225.44s)]
*  And he was visiting America from another country, [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10226.76s)]
*  and he decided just to go back to his own country [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10230.08s)]
*  and have it done there, but he was just shocked [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10231.0s)]
*  at how just the price went down [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10232.8s)]
*  because they were gonna possibly lose the patient, right? [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10235.119999999999s)]
*  Which is the way that businesses should be, [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10237.16s)]
*  the potential that you could lose the customer. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10239.6s)]
*  What about the Federal Reserve? [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10242.039999999999s)]
*  What is it, and is it fucking us? [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10243.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, totally. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10246.84s)]
*  Oh, it's the worst thing. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10248.08s)]
*  I've heard about this, Ben Askren. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10249.359999999999s)]
*  It's the worst thing about our government [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10250.199999999999s)]
*  is the Federal Reserve. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10252.92s)]
*  Because I notice this, if I make money [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10253.76s)]
*  and I pay taxes on it, right, [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10255.119999999999s)]
*  and then if I use that money to pay somebody for something, [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10257.0s)]
*  they have to pay taxes on it, [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10260.96s)]
*  if I die, I get taxed like 30, 40% on the money [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10262.679999999998s)]
*  that I'd already paid taxes on. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10267.279999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, and then you, like, I mean, it's insane. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10269.08s)]
*  And then when you, if you think about how much money [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10271.64s)]
*  is actually taxed, I mean, like, it's not just like [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10273.759999999998s)]
*  that you pay taxes on, but then if you go [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10276.08s)]
*  and buy something from someone else, [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10279.0s)]
*  then they gotta pay taxes on the money [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10280.56s)]
*  that you already paid taxes on. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10282.24s)]
*  It's just, it's nutty. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10283.88s)]
*  But the Federal Reserve is the central bank. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10285.640000000001s)]
*  That's, so it's all kind of confusing [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10288.28s)]
*  because they call it, like, the Federal Reserve. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10291.960000000001s)]
*  And so you kind of get this impression that it, like, [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10294.12s)]
*  well, it's part of the federal government [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10296.4s)]
*  where they keep reserves of some money [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10298.24s)]
*  or something like that, but that's not what it is at all. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10300.28s)]
*  It's technically not even a part of the government. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10302.36s)]
*  It is, it's the worst of the government [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10304.92s)]
*  and the worst of not the government, right? [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10307.36s)]
*  So it was created by an act of Congress in 1913. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10310.2s)]
*  It's the treasurer, the head of the Federal Reserve [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10313.28s)]
*  is appointed by the president. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10316.68s)]
*  So it's, in that sense, very much a part of the government. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10318.16s)]
*  However, it gets to maintain its status [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10321.480000000001s)]
*  as a private independent company. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10323.720000000001s)]
*  They print the money and then lend it to us. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10325.76s)]
*  So they charge us for using dollars at all. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10329.24s)]
*  They make money off the fact that we use our own currency, [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10333.08s)]
*  that they're just given the right to print out of thin air. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10337.400000000001s)]
*  So they're a bank. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10340.04s)]
*  In effect, print out of thin air. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10340.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, most of it's done on computers these days. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10343.36s)]
*  But so what they do is, it was created [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10345.12s)]
*  by a bunch of powerful bankers. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10347.68s)]
*  There's a great book on this called [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10349.68s)]
*  The Creature from Jekyll Island [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10351.04s)]
*  that really goes through the whole history of it. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10353.0s)]
*  But a bunch of- [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10354.68s)]
*  Let's order that book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10355.52s)]
*  Oh, it's a good one. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10356.960000000001s)]
*  By G. Edward Griffin. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10358.68s)]
*  The- [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10363.16s)]
*  Yeah, we'll have to order it right now, [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10364.0s)]
*  but let's go back to that Federal Reserve. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10364.84s)]
*  Yes, it's a great book. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10366.24s)]
*  I highly recommend everyone read it. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10367.08s)]
*  It's also Ron Paul and the Fed is another great book [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10368.16s)]
*  on the Federal Reserve also. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10370.6s)]
*  But so they are, so essentially they print the money [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10372.04s)]
*  and then lend it out. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10375.6s)]
*  Now they lend it out to what are called their member banks, [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10377.36s)]
*  meaning all the big banks. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10381.28s)]
*  So JP Morgan Chase, Schwab, Bank of America, [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10382.720000000001s)]
*  all these guys. All these guys, yes. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10386.12s)]
*  So they lend it out to them. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10387.44s)]
*  And then those banks lend money to the rest of us [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10389.6s)]
*  at a much higher interest rate than they got it for. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10393.560000000001s)]
*  So all of the banks now are in the business essentially [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10395.880000000001s)]
*  of getting free money. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10398.480000000001s)]
*  They just get the money at low interest [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10399.800000000001s)]
*  and lend it out to us at higher interest. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10401.4s)]
*  So they all get rich off of this. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10403.199999999999s)]
*  It allows the government to spend as much money [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10404.84s)]
*  as they want to because they can print as much money [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10406.8s)]
*  as they want to while it destroys the currency [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10408.76s)]
*  of the rest of us. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10411.0s)]
*  And the worst thing about the Federal Reserve [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10412.279999999999s)]
*  from my perspective is that it lets the government [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10414.279999999999s)]
*  get away with just really evil things [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10417.24s)]
*  that they would never be able to get away with [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10420.039999999999s)]
*  if they couldn't print all the money. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10421.96s)]
*  So you could do lockdowns and then just hand out checks [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10424.199999999999s)]
*  because you can print the money. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10429.16s)]
*  But if you couldn't hand out the checks, [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10430.640000000001s)]
*  you probably wouldn't be able to get away with lockdowns. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10431.76s)]
*  You could fight a war in Afghanistan for 20 years. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10433.52s)]
*  Now if you had to tax people for that war, [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10436.12s)]
*  if you had to say, okay, listen, [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10438.2s)]
*  we want to fight a war in Afghanistan, [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10439.32s)]
*  so every quarter we're going to come to you [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10441.0s)]
*  for another 10% of your income, [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10443.12s)]
*  there'd be massive pressure from people to end the war. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10445.960000000001s)]
*  But since they just print the money, [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10448.52s)]
*  they're able to keep it going for 20 years. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10449.880000000001s)]
*  And it also does a lot to distort markets [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10452.84s)]
*  and just mess everything up [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10455.16s)]
*  because they pump money into markets [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10456.36s)]
*  where there's no real demand for there to be growth there. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10457.84s)]
*  It's a huge scheme. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10461.4s)]
*  It's privately owned. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10463.08s)]
*  We don't even have real information on it. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10464.52s)]
*  There's never been a full audit of the Federal Reserve. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10466.44s)]
*  Ron Paul was the only one in Congress [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10469.36s)]
*  who was really pushing for an audit. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10471.32s)]
*  I think Thomas Massey also was, but never got it done. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10473.92s)]
*  The Federal Government sets the salaries [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10477.68s)]
*  of the Board's seven members, [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10479.12s)]
*  of the Board's seven governors, [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10482.0s)]
*  and it receives all the system's annual profits [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10483.560000000001s)]
*  after dividends on member banks' capital investments [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10485.32s)]
*  are paid. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10487.92s)]
*  The Federal Reserve earned a net income [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10489.240000000002s)]
*  of $100.2 billion in 2015 [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10490.800000000001s)]
*  and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10494.04s)]
*  So they make some money in there. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10497.880000000001s)]
*  They made $5 billion. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10499.12s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing is that their books [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10500.560000000001s)]
*  have never been opened and audited, [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10502.84s)]
*  so we don't really know exactly what's going on. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10504.560000000001s)]
*  Are we based on gold or not? [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10506.960000000001s)]
*  No, we haven't been on gold for many years. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10509.16s)]
*  It was in 1973 or 71, was it? [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10512.08s)]
*  Nixon suspended the gold standard [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10515.68s)]
*  and we've never been back on it since then. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10517.560000000001s)]
*  71, sorry, I should have had that one. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10519.16s)]
*  Why did they suspend the gold standard? [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10521.4s)]
*  Well, so basically. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10523.04s)]
*  Let me say the gold standard was a monetary system [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10524.640000000001s)]
*  that linked a country's currency to a set amount of gold. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10526.32s)]
*  So our currency was actually backed by an actual gold. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10528.92s)]
*  The idea was that for every dollar you printed, [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10533.68s)]
*  you had to put away a certain amount of gold. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10536.800000000001s)]
*  So, okay, so what I was talking about before [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10539.04s)]
*  after World War II, Europe is destroyed, [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10540.92s)]
*  America is still left stable. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10543.720000000001s)]
*  This is when America, they created what was known [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10545.6s)]
*  as the Bretton Wood Agreement. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10547.76s)]
*  So essentially, America was like the dominant power [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10549.800000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10553.24s)]
*  We had the huge portion of the world's gold at this point. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10554.08s)]
*  And so the deal that we came up with [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10558.28s)]
*  was essentially that other countries [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10560.52s)]
*  would peg their currency to the dollar [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10563.880000000001s)]
*  and we would peg the dollar to gold. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10566.28s)]
*  So you were kinda on a gold standard [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10568.640000000001s)]
*  if you went on a dollar standard. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10572.04s)]
*  Got it. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10573.560000000001s)]
*  So we had the price at $35 an ounce. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10574.44s)]
*  So for every $35 we printed, [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10576.6s)]
*  we had to put away an ounce of gold. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10579.64s)]
*  Okay, so this was the deal. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10581.48s)]
*  Into Fort Knox? [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10582.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's where it was supposed to be caught. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10583.44s)]
*  Also has not been audited, [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10585.44s)]
*  but I think that's where it was supposed to be. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10587.4s)]
*  Oh, that bitch is empty, I'm sure, dude. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10588.24s)]
*  It's, I think, long gone. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10590.56s)]
*  But so, okay, so then you have, [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10592.119999999999s)]
*  so this starts in the, what year, late 40s? [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10594.119999999999s)]
*  Bretton Woods started, I wanna say 47. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10597.8s)]
*  Yeah, the gold standard was largely abandoned [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10599.64s)]
*  during the Great Depression before being reinstated [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10601.279999999999s)]
*  in a limited form. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10603.32s)]
*  So we had gotten off of it and then gotten back onto it. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10605.08s)]
*  But so what happened is, [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10607.68s)]
*  when we're on the Bretton Woods standard, [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10609.0s)]
*  we go onto it in the late 40s, [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10610.84s)]
*  so through the 50s and into the 60s. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10612.76s)]
*  Okay, and that standard was. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10615.68s)]
*  Oh, was it early? [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10616.52s)]
*  It was before the war ended, is that right? [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10617.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10619.24s)]
*  And that standard was that for every ounce of gold [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10620.08s)]
*  we had so much money. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10622.119999999999s)]
*  That's right. $35. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10623.6s)]
*  Yes. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10624.6s)]
*  And then other countries had penned their, [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10625.44s)]
*  or used the dollar. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10627.88s)]
*  Their currency to the dollar. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10628.72s)]
*  So they're holding dollars, [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10629.8s)]
*  but the dollars are redeemable in gold. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10631.52s)]
*  Like that's the idea that you could trade them in [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10634.92s)]
*  for gold any time you want to. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10635.92s)]
*  So it was all real. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10636.76s)]
*  There was a checks and balances system. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10637.6s)]
*  Right, except that they, we started cheating. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10638.92s)]
*  And we started cheating really blatantly. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10642.8s)]
*  And so in the 1960s, if you could think about it right, [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10644.68s)]
*  America is doing a lot. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10648.4s)]
*  In the 1960s, we have the Great Society. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10650.6s)]
*  We created Medicare and Medicaid. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10653.84s)]
*  We put a man on the moon. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10657.12s)]
*  We fought the war in Vietnam. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10658.68s)]
*  America is just spending a ton of money. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10660.44s)]
*  And so what happened is that a lot of people [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10662.560000000001s)]
*  were holding dollars. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10665.800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10667.2s)]
*  And they're holding dollars that they're promised [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10668.04s)]
*  are good, are convertible to gold. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10669.36s)]
*  And I believe it was mostly led by France, [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10672.04s)]
*  but I think England was involved in this too. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10674.36s)]
*  But they essentially called America's bluff. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10676.6s)]
*  And they went, you know, you guys are spending [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10679.2s)]
*  a whole lot of money thinking we'll take our gold. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10681.44s)]
*  Like we got all these dollars, [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10685.08s)]
*  we'd like to convert them into gold. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10686.24s)]
*  So they called America's bluff. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10688.0s)]
*  And Richard Nixon was like, nah. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10689.88s)]
*  And so the way he spun it, it was just a giant default. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10693.72s)]
*  Slick Rick. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10697.679999999998s)]
*  It was just a huge default to the world. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10698.599999999999s)]
*  Like we're just not, no. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10700.72s)]
*  But the way he spun it, [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10702.64s)]
*  which is actually pretty laughable if you, [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10704.08s)]
*  it was, he was like, you know, [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10706.119999999999s)]
*  the French are trying to destabilize the dollar [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10707.92s)]
*  and we will not let this attack stand. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10711.839999999998s)]
*  So I have to temporarily, those were his words, [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10714.039999999999s)]
*  temporarily suspend the convertibility from dollars into gold. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10716.880000000001s)]
*  So he basically told them, go fuck yourself. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10721.48s)]
*  You know, we don't have gold, [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10724.2s)]
*  but we do have a much bigger military than you. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10725.68s)]
*  So you will take this, you know? [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10727.68s)]
*  And then, you know, throughout the years, [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10729.64s)]
*  I mean, America just came to continue to dominate the world. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10732.48s)]
*  So there was no real option for France to do nothing. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10735.0s)]
*  But ever since then, we have not been on a gold standard [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10737.76s)]
*  or any standard whatsoever. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10740.92s)]
*  They can print as much money as they want to with no limit. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10742.960000000001s)]
*  It says the Nixon shock was the effect of a series [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10745.72s)]
*  of economic measures, including wage and price freezes, [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10747.64s)]
*  surcharges on imports and the unilateral cancellation [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10750.48s)]
*  of the direct international convertibility [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10753.279999999999s)]
*  of the United States dollar gold. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10755.279999999999s)]
*  Although Nixon's actions did not formally abolish [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10757.4s)]
*  the existing Bretton Woods system [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10759.56s)]
*  of international financial exchange, [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10760.96s)]
*  the suspension of one of its key components effectively [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10762.76s)]
*  rendered the Bretton Woods system inoperative. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10765.039999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10767.0s)]
*  And what happened to all the gold in Fort Knox then? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10767.84s)]
*  Your guess is as good as mine. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10770.76s)]
*  Can we look that up? [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10772.16s)]
*  What happened to all the gold [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10772.98s)]
*  after the Bretton Woods system? [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10773.88s)]
*  I don't know what worked. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10778.16s)]
*  I mean, I think they would say they still have it, [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10779.0s)]
*  but again, it's like much like the Federal Reserve. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10780.439999999999s)]
*  I believe, I don't think Fort Knox has been audited [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10782.64s)]
*  in all of this time. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10785.279999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10786.279999999999s)]
*  So I don't think we really know, you know? [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10787.119999999999s)]
*  We gotta get in that bitch. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10788.88s)]
*  I'm gonna ask Trump if I get to see him. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10790.119999999999s)]
*  Vance would give us an honest answer, I think. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10792.32s)]
*  Are you going to the inauguration? [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10794.599999999999s)]
*  I think I'm gonna go because, [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10796.24s)]
*  well, first of all, I got excited to go. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10797.839999999998s)]
*  I got invited to go. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10799.56s)]
*  And then I never will get to go again. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10801.0s)]
*  Are you going? [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10804.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10804.92s)]
*  Just because I got invited and it's just kind of like, [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10805.76s)]
*  how could you not go? [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10807.88s)]
*  I mean, it's like, it's American history. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10809.36s)]
*  And it's also, this was such a big election too. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10811.76s)]
*  It feels like such a seismic shift. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10813.8s)]
*  And I got invited and I'm just like, come on. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10815.66s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10818.08s)]
*  I can't not, I'm too much of a history nerd [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10819.24s)]
*  to not be like there for that. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10821.72s)]
*  Yeah, you have to go. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10822.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10824.2s)]
*  And I love that you always seem to have [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10825.04s)]
*  this open-ended, like, you're not really, [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10826.36s)]
*  you're not attached to, [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10829.8s)]
*  it feels like you don't really attach yourself to, [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10831.24s)]
*  you don't get overly attached. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10834.960000000001s)]
*  Well, I try to be attached to principles, [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10837.32s)]
*  and not be attached to politicians. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10841.08s)]
*  So, it's like, I supported Trump in this last election [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10843.720000000001s)]
*  just because I thought Kamala Harris was, [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10847.08s)]
*  I thought she was such an insult to all of us. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10848.68s)]
*  It was like, come on, you can't actually do this. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10851.48s)]
*  And to not have a primary and then just hand select her [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10853.44s)]
*  and then all the lying about Biden, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10856.880000000001s)]
*  all that going around with the chutes. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10859.36s)]
*  Yeah, the lying about Biden was crazy. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10860.640000000001s)]
*  I just couldn't stand that, so I supported Trump. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10861.720000000001s)]
*  But as soon as Trump starts doing something [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10863.560000000001s)]
*  I think is wrong, I'll be the first one to be like, [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10865.08s)]
*  yeah, dude, he's fucking up. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10867.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10868.640000000001s)]
*  I think that's the way everyone should be. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10869.480000000001s)]
*  I think people are way, way, way, I hate, [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10870.960000000001s)]
*  I'm also glad for that, that election season's over. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10873.28s)]
*  I hate when people get so, like, dug in. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10875.640000000001s)]
*  Me too. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10878.28s)]
*  Where it's like, you're not even really being a person, [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10879.12s)]
*  you're not even really having a conversation anymore. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10880.240000000002s)]
*  You're kind of getting into this, like, [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10882.480000000001s)]
*  once you pick a side and you're like, [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10884.08s)]
*  I've decided my side is the good side, [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10886.320000000002s)]
*  they're the evil side. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10887.800000000001s)]
*  Now you're in a, like, ends justify the means conversation. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10889.12s)]
*  Now you're trying to make the world fit that. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10892.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10893.960000000001s)]
*  And it's also just a thing where it's like, [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10895.04s)]
*  you would see this all the time, [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10896.52s)]
*  especially during the election. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10898.36s)]
*  I mean, I remember being on a couple of these shows [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10899.960000000001s)]
*  that I do where I think I said to Piers Morgan [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10902.04s)]
*  at one point, like, I was just like, [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10904.240000000002s)]
*  maybe everyone will be willing to have a conversation [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10906.52s)]
*  in a couple weeks once this election's over, [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10908.92s)]
*  but right now everyone's just in their dumb, like, [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10910.6s)]
*  because you get to a point where you're like, [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10913.04s)]
*  I gotta just win, my side has to win. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10914.92s)]
*  And it doesn't matter about, like, telling the truth, [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10917.04s)]
*  it doesn't matter about actually grappling [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10920.039999999999s)]
*  with what the other person said. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10920.88s)]
*  So I try my best to stay away from that. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10922.28s)]
*  I think it's not good for you. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10925.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, I think that's really how I am. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10927.12s)]
*  I'm not, like, I'm not the, [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10929.48s)]
*  I was never the biggest Republican or the biggest Democrat. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10930.96s)]
*  I feel like I was always, I mean, I guess I voted Democrat, [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10933.52s)]
*  had voted Democrat most of my life, you know, [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10936.52s)]
*  but I want there to be more parties than there are. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10938.96s)]
*  You know, I want, I just want things to be real, [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10942.64s)]
*  or I just wanna know what's really going on. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10946.32s)]
*  I just don't like being, like, taken advantage of. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10949.76s)]
*  That's the thing I don't like. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10951.72s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think that's my biggest curiosity, [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10953.32s)]
*  you know, usually is, is trying to think, [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10955.56s)]
*  trying to get things to be fair. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10958.32s)]
*  And yeah, just to have a voice if I'm right or wrong. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10961.56s)]
*  You know, I tried, you know, I tried to speak up [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10963.92s)]
*  for what I felt like was, seemed like tried to be the best, [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10966.12s)]
*  you know, or whatever I thought was the best. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10969.08s)]
*  But then sometimes you're also so deceived, you don't know. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10970.92s)]
*  And that's one thing that's kind of fascinating about life. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10973.44s)]
*  And that's one thing that I think does get me up these days. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10975.6s)]
*  It's like, what a tricky fucking little game of thrones [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10978.32s)]
*  we're in, right? [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10983.0s)]
*  And everybody should feel that way. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10984.0s)]

*  Because it's like someone, you know, [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10993.84s)]
*  it's like someone online who you don't even know. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10995.88s)]
*  You could see a video and someone's saying something [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10997.52s)]
*  really compelling and you're like, oh, that's interesting. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=10999.16s)]

*  I'm really excited to go out there in a few days. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11089.52s)]
*  And then Louisville, Fort Wayne, Key West. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11092.32s)]
*  Ooh, wow. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11096.72s)]

*  Maybe Nick Swartz will be down there at the bar. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11098.96s)]
*  He spent a year in Key West during COVID at the fucking. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11100.72s)]

*  This is alleged and I love Nick. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11106.6s)]
*  And he came here and told this story. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11108.36s)]
*  I think he spent a million dollars at a hotel there. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11110.52s)]
*  Just staying in a hotel every night, basically. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11113.44s)]
*  Yeah, I guess if you do that for a year, [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11115.92s)]
*  you could rack up a lot of money. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11117.32s)]
*  Down in the Florida. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11118.88s)]
*  I went to Key West for, it's supposed to be 10 days. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11120.800000000001s)]
*  During the pandemic. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11123.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I was there a year and a half. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11123.880000000001s)]
*  I heard that you ran up a bill at the hotel there [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11125.68s)]
*  that was like astronomical. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11128.6s)]
*  It was insane. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11130.08s)]
*  I stayed at a resort on the beach for a year and a half. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11130.92s)]
*  And it cost, I heard a million dollars. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11133.36s)]
*  I don't think it was a million, but it was a lot of money. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11134.72s)]
*  If you tipped, did you tip? [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11137.12s)]
*  I always tipped. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11138.6s)]
*  What do you think it was? [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11139.44s)]
*  When you say a lot of money, how much was it? [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11140.28s)]
*  I mean, it was definitely probably half a mil for sure. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11142.08s)]
*  But I feel like it was more than a million. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11146.12s)]
*  It might have been. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11148.2s)]
*  I kind of don't wanna know. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11149.080000000002s)]
*  Yep, see? [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11151.080000000002s)]
*  And that's our federal reserve right there. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11151.92s)]
*  Well, that is, it's true. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11153.640000000001s)]
*  And that's how our federal reserve operates. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11154.84s)]
*  You could've done that for 50 grand on my grandpa's dollar. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11156.68s)]
*  But there you go. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11158.6s)]
*  Yeah, you can't stay at a resort for a year and a half, man. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11160.160000000002s)]
*  That's gonna be a really big bill. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11162.44s)]
*  But then also, man, it's so like, [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11164.12s)]

*  He's like, you know what? [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11169.68s)]
*  Fuck it, the world might be ending. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11170.52s)]
*  I might have like lung AIDS or whatever the kid, [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11172.44s)]
*  whatever they were calling COVID. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11175.04s)]
*  And I'm gonna go sit, [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11176.800000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna have a margarita and listen to some Jimmy Buffet. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11178.0s)]
*  There's, I definitely know people who did worse [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11180.84s)]
*  during the pandemic than that. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11183.48s)]

*  obviously like more so now, but even before then, [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11289.88s)]

*  like even, which is where I'm from, where I started, [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11299.16s)]
*  even when I go back there, [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11301.64s)]
*  like I feel like I don't know anyone anymore. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11302.6s)]

*  when it always, every night would be, [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11311.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11316.96s)]
*  It's just, I guess that's part of just getting old. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11317.8s)]
*  Part of that's getting older too, yeah, it is. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11319.88s)]

*  Oh, no. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11335.8s)]
*  I was like, if you didn't really tear into the Jews. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11336.64s)]
*  No, no, no, no, you didn't offend me at all. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11337.96s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11339.68s)]
*  I think you made perfect sense. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11340.52s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes I, some stuff that's hard to talk about, [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11342.68s)]
*  I think I'm trying to do a better job this year [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11345.12s)]
*  of like being brave about trying to talk about some things, [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11346.92s)]
*  even if it feels kind of scary. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11349.88s)]
*  Sometimes I have a tough time like, [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11352.6s)]
*  like saying, hey, slow this down [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11357.44s)]
*  so I can make sure I know what I'm thinking too. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11359.72s)]
*  Like it's been a, learning to be in conversations has been, [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11362.32s)]
*  it's unreal, it's harder than you think, I think sometimes. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11366.2s)]
*  No, it's a real, it's a skillset. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11369.08s)]
*  It's a real skillset. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11369.960000000001s)]
*  And there's a difference also between just like, [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11371.0s)]
*  there's like, just like doing your own thing, [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11373.04s)]
*  like just ranting is a whole different skillset [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11376.2s)]
*  than like talking to somebody, you know what I mean? [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11378.32s)]
*  And I do think that like, [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11380.96s)]
*  I think there's nothing wrong with like being like, [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11382.199999999999s)]
*  hey, all right, hold on, let me think about that [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11384.359999999999s)]
*  for a little bit. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11386.64s)]
*  In fact, I think not nearly enough people do that [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11387.48s)]
*  in conversations. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11389.679999999998s)]
*  Really, huh, you just said something. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11390.839999999998s)]
*  Let me like actually think about that for a second. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11391.88s)]
*  Rather than just give you like my first, [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11394.72s)]
*  the first thought that comes to my mind, [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11396.72s)]
*  let me actually give you like what my genuine thought is. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11398.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna try to focus on that a little bit more [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11401.599999999999s)]
*  or unfocus on it a little bit [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11403.679999999998s)]
*  so just leave a little bit more room for things. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11405.08s)]
*  What was one other thing I was gonna say? [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11408.4s)]
*  Yeah, man, I just, I love the way you're able to think [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11411.679999999998s)]
*  and share and it feels very, [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11413.599999999999s)]
*  you always feel to me like you are being genuine [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11415.32s)]
*  to what you believe and that's something that I just, [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11419.16s)]
*  I think it's important, you know, [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11421.839999999998s)]
*  cause I think that people can know that that's true, [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11423.72s)]
*  whether you're right or wrong about stuff, [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11426.359999999999s)]

*  I feel like we're in a special time [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11434.56s)]
*  where people are trying to figure stuff out. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11436.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well, I appreciate that [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11439.28s)]
*  and that's always what I admire in other people [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11442.2s)]
*  so that's kind of like what I always try to do. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11445.480000000001s)]
*  Like I'm sure I'm wrong about a lot of stuff, [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11447.640000000001s)]
*  but I'm not lying about anything [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11450.24s)]
*  and I'm not, like I believe everything I'm saying. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyT0dZKmcBg&t=11452.2s)]
