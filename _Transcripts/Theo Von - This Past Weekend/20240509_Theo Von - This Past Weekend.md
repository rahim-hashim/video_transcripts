# Red Clay Strays  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #501
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k)
*  Today's guests are two members of a band that I really enjoy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=0.0s)]
*  They're out of Mobile, Alabama. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5.0s)]
*  They have a new album coming out in May, and they've been picking up some steam. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=8.0s)]
*  I'm grateful to spend time today with Brandon Coleman and Andy Bishop from the Red Clay Stray. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=13.0s)]
*  I love the style of his hair. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess Ben has that mustache. Some people can't grow certain facial hair. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=47.0s)]
*  Brandon's a native, man. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't really. I can grow a mustache and a little bit of a goatee, but that's it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=54.0s)]
*  Everything else doesn't work. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=59.0s)]
*  Really? Why? What happened? You weren't scalped or something. Somebody wasn't. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=61.0s)]
*  How native are you? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=65.0s)]
*  I'm like Cherokee, so. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=66.0s)]
*  Doing the scalping. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=68.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were doing the scalping. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=69.0s)]
*  Then you think you'd have a little extra collection. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=71.0s)]
*  You would think so, like if my grandmother would have passed them down or something, you know, but she never did any of that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=74.0s)]
*  Wow. And so was your grandmother, did she seem kind of native? Like did she have a kind of a vibe like that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=80.0s)]
*  A little bit. It was really my great, great grandmother. I have an old black and white photo of her somewhere that's she's just straight up Cherokee Indian. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=86.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=95.0s)]
*  That's like straight out of Red Dead Redemption 2, you know. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, do you feel native sometimes? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=100.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=102.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=104.0s)]
*  Like if you get near like, like I wonder if you hear stuff different than like a regular non-native person hears. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=105.0s)]
*  I'll speak on it. I think Brandon gets a little frisky when like a like a like a rainstorm's coming in, you know. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=121.0s)]
*  Him and his brother would take his brothers on the road with us to our videographers. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've met him one time and I met you guys. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=124.0s)]
*  He can actually throat sing pretty good too. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=126.0s)]
*  Yeah, he does it as a joke and everybody's like, you can't do that. He's like, I'm native. I can do that if I want to. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=128.0s)]
*  What he'll start really. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=133.0s)]
*  He'll get into it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=136.0s)]
*  So you can do it too. Watch out. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=137.0s)]
*  That's powerful, man. Yeah, one time I was up in Minnesota like in Minnetonka, Minnesota and I went to they had a what's it called like a big get together that natives have? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=139.0s)]
*  Powwow. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=149.0s)]
*  Every time I've heard the word powwow it just meant backing trucks up to a campfire and drinking whiskey all night. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that sounds pretty native to me too. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=158.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=159.0s)]
*  Cooking meat. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=160.0s)]
*  Throw a little gambling in there too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=162.0s)]
*  Powwow is a gathering with dances held by many Native Americans and First Nations communities. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=163.0s)]
*  I'd say so. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=167.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=168.0s)]
*  Ben was right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ben was right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=170.0s)]
*  I didn't sleep that great. You guys have that ever? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=171.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=174.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=175.0s)]
*  I don't think we sleep good till we go home. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=176.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=179.0s)]
*  I don't sleep well. Going out on the road it takes a couple of days to get used to sleeping on a bus and then getting home it takes a couple of days to get used to sleeping in your own bed again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=191.0s)]
*  So that equals about no sleep. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is kind of a, it's a real, you're always trying to get comfortable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=200.0s)]
*  That's what we carry a lot of Zquill on the bus. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=201.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=203.0s)]
*  That's the first couple of nights. Have you, have you pre-vosed it? You've been in the tour buses? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=204.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=208.0s)]
*  Those things are hard to sleep in for the first couple nights for me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=209.0s)]
*  What part do you sleep in and what part do you choose to sleep in? Like is there, because there's the different levels of the bunks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=218.0s)]
*  So we're in a crew bus still. So we travel 12D. We got the crew, everybody in one bus. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=219.0s)]
*  So I'm the back middle. Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm the top bunk. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=225.0s)]
*  We're looking for that second bus, but. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=226.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, we have one bus when we go and it's everybody's in there. They have a crew bus for like production. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=228.0s)]
*  So they're in a separate bus. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=234.0s)]
*  Ben's got some pictures. There you go. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=236.0s)]
*  There's definitely different values to the different slots, I think. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah. Our tour manager and keyboard player, they all prefer the bottom bunk. They say it's the nicest. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=243.0s)]
*  They said the worst part about the bottom bunk is if you blow a tire out, it scares the crap out of you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=249.0s)]
*  You're by everybody's feet. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=254.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's a good point. I guess there's a lot more dirt down there. There's a little bit of foot traffic if you open the curtain. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=256.0s)]
*  People throwing their shoes off and then you know, you got to wake up, move shoes out of the way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=262.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. Yeah. You have to really want to get up. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=265.0s)]
*  So I will tell you our old bus, what we call it, it's a bus. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=269.0s)]
*  The one we traveled in before, it's like a redneck Prevost. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=273.0s)]
*  It was a 99E450 with six bunks built in the back of it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=276.0s)]
*  You could probably Google it, Ben. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could. The Breeze is what we named it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=283.0s)]
*  And this was homemade. So this is how you guys first, when you guys started hitting the road. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=285.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it, we broke down a lot. Picked ourselves up off the side of the road multiple times. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=289.0s)]
*  We started looking for a van and the vans were just so expensive at the time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=295.0s)]
*  So yeah, there's a front up there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=301.0s)]
*  Wow. I don't know if we have a picture of the inside. Probably not. Not on the internet. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=304.0s)]
*  That's an old picture. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=308.0s)]
*  And this looks like one of those things where they go to pick up seniors kind of to take them to market and stuff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=309.0s)]
*  Is it that sort of? Yeah. Like a shuttle bus. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=313.0s)]
*  Did it have that sort of door on it? That's us waving goodbye. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was when we got the new bus. It had the door, it had an electric open. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=318.0s)]
*  We ended up just getting rid of it. And then our security system was just a ratchet strap. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=324.0s)]
*  It had an eye bolt on it and we just hooked to it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=329.0s)]
*  It was rough. At night time, yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=331.0s)]
*  But we were practically diesel mechanics. If you ever got a 7.3 and you worked on it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=333.0s)]
*  Because there's so many breakdowns you mean? Yeah. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah. We had one at a, we had one. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=341.0s)]
*  Well, we had a guy that refused to, he would buzz cut his hair every day, refused to cut any of his ear hair. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=346.0s)]
*  What about his nose hair? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=355.0s)]
*  It was all coming out of his ears. Whatever was supposed to be in his nose had really had gone upstream, I guess. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=357.0s)]
*  You could see it? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=365.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You could see it. I mean, it was like his, you know. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=366.0s)]
*  One of those little troll dolls. Yes. Yeah. Like one of those dolls you would get at school. You put on your pencil. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=370.0s)]
*  You got to cut that at night. You got to do it for him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=376.0s)]
*  Oh, I think the moon cuts his hair. It was very, I mean, it was like, it was involved in something extra terrestrial. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=379.0s)]
*  And he had, but that thing broke down a couple of times. And one time he just threw a cup of water on it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=387.0s)]
*  I was like, that's not how we got to get it. Is he shampooing it? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=392.0s)]
*  I'm talking about the engine. The engine broke down one time and he threw a cup of water on it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=396.0s)]
*  I thought you were talking about his ear hair. Oh, the ear hair? No. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=399.0s)]
*  We've thrown our share. Well, we blew a hub. We had to throw water on it. Yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=402.0s)]
*  Mostly just to listen to it sizzle how hot it was. Yeah. It's hot. It's hot. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=407.0s)]
*  That's always the best mechanic, dude, when you just crack that thing over here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=413.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, we've had some. There was one. You remember the, oh, we blew a heater hose and it had what's called a quick connect on it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=417.0s)]
*  Was it a heater hose? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=425.0s)]
*  Are you talking about Joe? No, this was me and you. You remember I spit on it. Oh yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=427.0s)]
*  We couldn't get it to go over that little. It's like you just push it on it clips and that's it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=431.0s)]
*  And we just fought with it for hours. I was like, you know what? We missed our show. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=435.0s)]
*  We had to cancel our show and everything because we could not get this thing to slide up. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=438.0s)]
*  It just needed a, and I was like, you know what? Screw it. I went in there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=441.0s)]
*  We're all sitting in the bus kind of thinking about what to do. I went out there and spit on it and pushed it on there and got it good. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=444.0s)]
*  And it worked. Just needed a little move, man. That's it. Oh, that's all you need a lot of times. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=449.0s)]
*  Um, red clay strays, man. Uh, thank you guys for coming in. Thanks for having us. Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=454.0s)]
*  I'm such a big fan guys. Why? Uh, I don't know. There's something damn. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=460.0s)]
*  There's something just damn. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=467.0s)]
*  His it feels like a little bit whimsical, historical, romantic about the music, you know, thank you. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=470.0s)]
*  Thank you. There's something that feels like you just hop on the clock hands and just start spinning backwards. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=477.0s)]
*  And it's like, it almost feels like a little bit of like a time warp. I don't know. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=484.0s)]
*  This just feels, it feels good, man. It feels good to listen to. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=487.0s)]
*  Well, that's cool. You know, um, I know you guys started, you guys are from the South. You guys are from Alabama, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=491.0s)]
*  We all still live there. Yeah. Born and raised mobile. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=497.0s)]
*  And how do you guys, was it a couple of you at first? You guys have five guys now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=500.0s)]
*  We have six now. Okay. Uh, but yeah, it was originally five. Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=505.0s)]
*  We just, we just, uh, hired a keyboard player. Oh, wow. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=510.0s)]
*  Like last month. Yep. And did you audition for that or how'd that go? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=514.0s)]
*  We actually met him on, uh, when we were touring with L King and he was playing with L at the time. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=518.0s)]
*  And then we realized last summer that he wasn't playing with L anymore and, you know, reached out to him. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=522.0s)]
*  Immediately. It was one of those, we showed up like we're sevens. He's like, he's not with us anymore. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=529.0s)]
*  We turned around, made a phone call. Like we got him now. He's ours. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=534.0s)]
*  You're like, they let him go. That's crazy. Yeah. Oh, that's perfect then. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=539.0s)]
*  So is that needed because you want to add a different element to the music or what do you, why do you, how do you come to make that choice? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=543.0s)]
*  Kind of. I think it's, yeah, we just wanted to, we've always wanted a keys player to, you know, lay down piano and organ tracks. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=550.0s)]
*  And, uh, I could play a little bit, but not near as good as we needed, I guess. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=558.0s)]
*  So that's always been a thing we've wanted to add in our music. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=564.0s)]
*  And it was supposed to be, we were going to get our drummer's little brother to play keys with us and he passed away in 2020. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=569.0s)]
*  So that was sevens was, is the right guy to fill that role that was originally intended for him, I think. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=576.0s)]
*  Was there like a trial night where he comes in and you're like, okay, this is. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=583.0s)]
*  Normally it would, we would hold an audition, but we already knew how great of a player he was from seeing him play with Elle and just sitting around in green rooms when there'd be a piano in the green room. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=588.0s)]
*  And he, we, you know, we saw him play and how good he was. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=598.0s)]
*  So I think we've always been kind of looking for that piano player. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=602.0s)]
*  And when we saw him with Elle, like Brandon said, it's one of those like, dang, that guy's, uh, he's good. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=605.0s)]
*  So when we saw that opportunity, we jumped on it as soon as we could. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=610.0s)]
*  And he fits in just long with us. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=613.0s)]
*  Yeah. When we called, we weren't like, do you want to audition for us? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=616.0s)]
*  We were like, Hey, do you want to play with us? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=618.0s)]
*  But here we are, we're auditioning, we'll audition in front of house guys and guitar techs, but. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=620.0s)]
*  And how does the band start to form up? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=626.0s)]
*  Like when it started out, how does that, how does a band even start? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=628.0s)]
*  Cause I'm used to just hearing some guys like get together, write down a song or whatever, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=632.0s)]
*  and then just kind of get in a fight at somebody's house and then the band is done. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=638.0s)]
*  We do that. We just haven't quit yet. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=642.0s)]
*  Plenty of fights have happened. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=646.0s)]
*  Now it's, uh, I had actually met Drew, uh, right when I was still in high school. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=648.0s)]
*  And then Drew introduced me to Andrew, uh, and we had started a little cover band. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=654.0s)]
*  The guitar player, he was actually the manager at the time. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=660.0s)]
*  And, uh, you know, that band played for a while and we had actually hired John in that band [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=663.0s)]
*  and he played for a couple months before it dissolved. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=671.0s)]
*  And then we hired Zach, our guitar player, and started calling ourselves Red Clay Strayz. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=674.0s)]
*  And then Drew, eventually we learned that he could sing and he was learning how to play guitar at the time. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=680.0s)]
*  So we started getting Drew to come on stage with us. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=686.0s)]
*  And, uh, when he first started getting on stage with us, he kept his amp turned all the way down. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=688.0s)]
*  He wouldn't even actually play. Yeah. He was just really shy. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=693.0s)]
*  I didn't know there's a way to be shy on there with your band. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=697.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. He was faking it until he made it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=701.0s)]
*  That's one thing that was cool to see is, uh, cause I lived with him and just, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=703.0s)]
*  he would lock herself in his room every day pretty much for like a year [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=707.0s)]
*  and just taught herself how to play guitar. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=711.0s)]
*  And so I used to tell him to stop playing too. I feel bad now. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=714.0s)]
*  He'd be in there in the old band. We'd be, uh, ending practice and he'd have like a beer bottle, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=718.0s)]
*  just raking it across the strings. And I'd just have to tell him like, dude, you gotta, you gotta give me a minute. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=723.0s)]
*  You gotta stop. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=728.0s)]
*  And now he's like, uh, Drew's one of those, um, he gets the most improvement award every year for us. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=730.0s)]
*  He just gets better and better. And it's just, he's good. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=736.0s)]
*  I wish I had his work ethic when it came to learning an instrument. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=739.0s)]
*  So he was, it was just, so he was on with you guys and then he got better? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=743.0s)]
*  Well, he was the manager and our first band. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=748.0s)]
*  And then when Red Clay Stray started, the five of us started that, you know, together. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=751.0s)]
*  There he is, handsome, handsome devil there. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=755.0s)]
*  He's like, I gotta get in here. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=757.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think he, uh, he just, he's got it in his song. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=758.0s)]
*  He, he wrote him and Brandon's little brother, Matthew, write our songs pretty much 50 50 and Brandon writes some too. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=762.0s)]
*  So I think it's just natural in him. He just had to find that way, getting it out. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=769.0s)]
*  And I think what got us, what got him on stage was we noticed he was singing harmonies at practice. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=773.0s)]
*  So we're like, Hey, get on stage and start singing with us. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=779.0s)]
*  And he, he didn't want to just be standing on stage empty handed. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=781.0s)]
*  So he would turn the guitar down and just hold the guitar pretty much. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=784.0s)]
*  And then somewhere along the line to start decided that he wanted to start actually playing. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=788.0s)]
*  So he taught herself. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=792.0s)]
*  Wow. That's amazing. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=793.0s)]
*  Zach, he's just always been. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=795.0s)]
*  Yeah. Zach's always been. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=797.0s)]
*  Incredible. Yeah. Zach just come right in, just ripping and shredding and blowing everybody away. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=798.0s)]
*  He's now it's surprising to see that Drew and Zach just two completely different styles and how they've learned off of one another over the years. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=803.0s)]
*  And so like in the past, probably year, things have started to get busier, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=812.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We've been, especially, uh, I think things really started taking off for us. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=817.0s)]
*  We were actually off the road last year, last fall in November, and we just see these numbers just like on a rocket ship. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=822.0s)]
*  Like, what's what the hell's going on? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=829.0s)]
*  Yeah. We just riding it out. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=831.0s)]
*  We hired my little brother who is the other songwriter. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=834.0s)]
*  So we had already we had already been playing all of his songs, you know, and but he would do his own thing. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=840.0s)]
*  And I think he was driving for Uber at the time. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=847.0s)]
*  And like last we took him on the Elking run last year and then officially hired him like last April. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=850.0s)]
*  And he just went right to work recording us and monitoring our social medias and building a social media presence and then popping off on TikTok. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=858.0s)]
*  I think a couple of times really. Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=868.0s)]
*  That would the El Tor just kind of jump started it a little bit for us. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=870.0s)]
*  Yeah, he does a great job because there's a lot of really he has a lot of fun clips on there. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=873.0s)]
*  You guys have some cool stuff on YouTube and stuff that I hadn't heard that wasn't released yet, just like on Spotify and stuff. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=877.0s)]
*  They used to be how we tour. Yeah, we toured off of YouTube. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=883.0s)]
*  We just tell people to call venues and tell them, check out YouTube and Facebook. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=886.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just, you know, hopefully they book us. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=890.0s)]
*  And a lot of them did. So that's what we did. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=893.0s)]
*  And when did you guys start touring pretty heavily? Kind of like when did it? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=897.0s)]
*  Oh, shoot. We used to play. I mean, we toured. We played 200 cat rooms. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=900.0s)]
*  I remember getting excited for 70 people showing up. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=904.0s)]
*  I mean, we've always been. We just wanted our big thing was going to be the hardest working band in America. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=907.0s)]
*  So we would, I mean, shoot, for the last couple of years, we've played majority of the year out on the road, especially last year. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=914.0s)]
*  We did over 150 shows driving ourselves. So it's like more of like 250 travel days or more. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=922.0s)]
*  And then that was the same the year before. We're just running around breaking down and just excited for 50 people to be in front of us. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=928.0s)]
*  Gosh. It's crazy to look back at that now. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=936.0s)]
*  And we always want to where we are now, we kind of always looked up to like, man, I want to play these clubs, you know, these thousand, two thousand cat rooms every night. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=939.0s)]
*  I could get used to that, like opening for people. And now we're there. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=947.0s)]
*  And now we're like, man, those arenas look fun. How about how about getting used to doing that? You know? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=949.0s)]
*  Yeah. Our festival. Do you guys do a lot of festivals too? Well, that'll probably happen this summer. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=955.0s)]
*  Yeah, we do a lot of festivals. Yeah. I don't know if we really like festivals as much. We like doing our own show. We're not pressed for time. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=959.0s)]
*  Festivals, you got to be you got to be on time with Sartan and Indon and that's just kind of we like to take our time and relax. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=965.0s)]
*  Set is really short too. It's like 45 minutes and it's like I'm just now starting to get warmed up at 45 minutes, you know, and then it's over with. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And we're not headlining festivals or playing at like three o'clock in the afternoon, you know. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=981.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Sunburn time. Oh, yeah. We just did it in Tortuga and Fort Lauderdale. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=986.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The Heatstroke Festival or whatever. Yeah. We we just felt like we just ruined everybody's beach party. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=991.0s)]
*  Oh, that's the worst. We have to play sad songs. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=997.0s)]
*  Dude, I know one night we had to play. I'm thinking of one time they put us at this Italian kind of cocaine sort of Christmas kind of party. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1000.0s)]
*  And it was this was in L.A. is probably about like maybe seven years ago. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1010.0s)]
*  Like, are you guys going to perform at this Christmas party? This cocaine Christmas party? Yeah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1016.0s)]
*  Well, everybody we get there early and everybody's trying to get us to do cocaine and we're doing it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1021.0s)]
*  And then like we had to perform, but we thought it would be like a stage and like a good setup. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1027.0s)]
*  So I think it had rained or something. And they put like this party in like a tent, one of those white tents with the fake plastic windows. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1034.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Like, yeah. And so we had to perform in there right next to the tables like you were some people's backs were like you were on the curve of the table in their backs and they were eating. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1044.0s)]
*  You don't stand up. Oh, it was just like in the way. It was so hard, especially on how I'm cocaine. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1054.0s)]
*  I'm sure too. Oh, it made me so like scared and nervous. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1060.0s)]
*  And some lady kept kind of biting her lip at me. And oh, that was one of the worst moments that ever happened. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1064.0s)]
*  She was probably doing the cocaine to that's probably that jaw thing that goes on. You know, everybody in the right misery. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1073.0s)]
*  Everybody was rattling, rattling. Everybody definitely had a catalytic converter. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1078.0s)]
*  It was just but that was it. That was a tough gig, man. We've had those tough gigs make you make you humble, though. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1085.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, we just had to go ahead. I think I know what you're going to talk about. I was going to talk about the purple buffalo. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1094.0s)]
*  Oh, I was going to talk about Dallas Cowboys. Was that a corporate gig? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1099.0s)]
*  No, I've done some really bad ones. I hate corporate corporate shows are terrible. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1104.0s)]
*  Yeah. Some guy made his son come up and give us ten dollars one night when we're on stage and it was we're performing like an empty backyard. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1108.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. And you're doing comedy. Yeah. I've never seen someone tip a comedian on stage. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1114.0s)]
*  Oh, live is getting ran across a child. Go give that nice man ten bucks. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1121.0s)]
*  I've had, you know, and I've had those shows too, where it's it's just like you're in someone's backyard and they're not paying attention. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1125.0s)]
*  But at least there's music and it's super loud and you can drown all that out. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1132.0s)]
*  I can only imagine being in that setting, trying to tell jokes and like nobody's paying attention to you. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1135.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know how you keep it together, man. I'd have an anxiety attack. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1141.0s)]
*  Just trying to it just you're like, yeah, this is what I deserve. That's where it kind of ends with he, you know, this tough part about the kid was he kept running across like halfway and then got confused with what to do. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1145.0s)]
*  And he would go back and ask his dad. So he it was just like, just give me the ten dollars or I'll come get it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1155.0s)]
*  But I can't. It was like I was just did you just take it from him and he started crying? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1162.0s)]
*  I was just like, don't drop out of school, kid. Thanks. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1166.0s)]
*  Oh, that was a really tough one. That's putting the ground in though. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1169.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, dude, I used to drive at one hundred and ten miles an hour to get to the next gig, putting everyone's life in danger so that I could perform it like an oh, Charlie somewhere. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1173.0s)]
*  It was like everybody. It was very. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1182.0s)]
*  We used to have our Mexican restaurant gigs back in the way back in the day doing four hour cover shows. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1186.0s)]
*  Oh, that sounds fun. It's not. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1191.0s)]
*  We play. It's fun for a minute for at least the first first hour. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1193.0s)]
*  There was one right before Covid had happened and it was a place called the Purple Buffalo and North Charleston. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1196.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we played like right after this heavy metal. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1203.0s)]
*  It was like a punk rock show. Yeah, like a punk rock show. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1207.0s)]
*  Three punk rock bands before us. And then you? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1210.0s)]
*  And then us. And we're playing covers at the time, too. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1213.0s)]
*  Our country bumpkin butts just get up there and just start playing music. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1216.0s)]
*  The room just empties out and we're literally playing to nobody. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1220.0s)]
*  And I just go out in the crowd and I just sit where the crowd would be where the crowd would be. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1223.0s)]
*  And I'm just sitting at the table singing to the band as they're playing. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1228.0s)]
*  And then the whole time, the bartender was like offering us drinks. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1233.0s)]
*  So we're and we're broke at the time, too. And we're just thinking, oh, cool. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1237.0s)]
*  At least we got a bar tab. At least we're going to get the drink. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1240.0s)]
*  And then after the show, she just brings us the bill. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1242.0s)]
*  We didn't even get paid to play. It was like didn't make any money. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1245.0s)]
*  Yeah. We're like looking around the bus for change. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1248.0s)]
*  Hey, our bar tab at this place. Just drank. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1251.0s)]
*  There's a picture of an actual purple buffalo. I prefer that one. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1254.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's nice. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1258.0s)]
*  That's what the place looks like with people in it. That's kind of cool. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1260.0s)]
*  I've met her before. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1263.0s)]
*  She parties, dude. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1265.0s)]
*  We've definitely had those those those empty shows where you just play for yourselves. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1267.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's when you really got to enjoy what you're doing. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1274.0s)]
*  We used to play for tips like just our tip bucket determined how far we were going to get the next day. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1277.0s)]
*  We'd have no money. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1282.0s)]
*  And, you know, we'd get tip money for gas and maybe even one hotel room for all five of us to pile up in. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1284.0s)]
*  And it was just chance every day, you know? Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1290.0s)]
*  Damn. Stayed in a lot of people's houses or even slept in the car a couple of times before we got the bus or shuttle bus. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1294.0s)]
*  That is the breeze. Yeah. Yeah. We've are. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1301.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say we're successful. We're not where we are from overnight, I guess. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1303.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what I was trying to get at a little bit. Just like thinking about all this stuff. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1307.0s)]
*  It's funny. A lot of times I'll forget about a lot of that. Oh, yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1311.0s)]
*  In a weird way. You can take it for granted pretty easily. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1315.0s)]
*  Yeah, not in it's weird for me. I don't even know if I take it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1318.0s)]
*  I just forget it's like you forget the work that you've put into something. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1320.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we've been doing me and you've been doing this since 2015. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1325.0s)]
*  So, you know, seven years, eight years. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1329.0s)]
*  I was in college to nine years for me and you. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1332.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've known. Yeah. Red Clays Trays. Red Clays Trays. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1335.0s)]
*  And the band before that, what was it called? Coleman Mason Band. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1338.0s)]
*  It was just a local cover band. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1341.0s)]
*  Band we don't speak of. Really? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1344.0s)]
*  We would we would run run the crowd out. Yeah. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1347.0s)]
*  I love that. Hey, look, look, then Red Clays Trays. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1350.0s)]
*  Yeah, we come in. We're coming as the bar closer, man. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1353.0s)]
*  They want to get them out. We got them out. Oh, I love that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1356.0s)]
*  It's like instead of playing closing time, it's like, let's hire this band. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll get them out. They'll get them out. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1363.0s)]
*  And you want to shut this thing down. We got you. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1366.0s)]
*  It's even with what we mainly ran people away because it was so loud. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1368.0s)]
*  The guitar amps were so loud. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1372.0s)]
*  But even with Red Clays Trays, we would be we were playing somewhere in. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1373.0s)]
*  At in Arkansas, where the guy, the sound man come up on stage and he told us to turn down. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1378.0s)]
*  And I was like, the only thing running through this system that you're wanting to turn down is my vocals. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1387.0s)]
*  Like the drums are still going to be loud. The guitars are still going to be loud. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1392.0s)]
*  And so I walk over there and I inch it down just a little bit and, you know, continue playing. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1395.0s)]
*  And he just like walks on after a song just right in the middle of the set. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1400.0s)]
*  So we're not doing this tonight. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1403.0s)]
*  And he just walks up and turns everything down by itself. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1404.0s)]
*  And I was just like, man, if I didn't need this five hundred dollars, I would freaking leave right now. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1407.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, we used to talk a mad game. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1412.0s)]
*  Was that a restaurant, too? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1414.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was in JJ's and Little Rock, Arkansas. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1416.0s)]
*  Was that Little Rock? No, that was Fayetteville, Arkansas. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1420.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the tough part. When you're going to compete with people's moment to dine. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1424.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a dinner. Yeah, those suck. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1429.0s)]
*  You're going to say, hey, set that fort down for a second, mama. I got something for you. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1432.0s)]
*  We'll give you a pork chop. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1438.0s)]
*  Can you turn the music down? Can you tell them to turn it down? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1439.0s)]
*  That's what playing with people eating is like. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1443.0s)]
*  And we used to do our own sound, too. So we used to make it real loud because we grew up listening like Skinner. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1446.0s)]
*  And we thought that's how it's supposed to be. Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1451.0s)]
*  We're still pretty loud. We're still pretty loud. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1453.0s)]
*  Yeah, we are probably still pretty loud. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1455.0s)]
*  You know, the number one thing I think that's tough sometimes if I go into like a small venue or like a like a just like a bar and somebody's playing is if they have if you can't hear the vocals a lot of times. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1457.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's it sucks because you're like, I don't I might love this. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1467.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why we try to hire a good good sound guy. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1472.0s)]
*  Dude, the sound guy is what I mean, that's your that's your he's practically a member of the band. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1476.0s)]
*  He's making you sound good for everybody. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1480.0s)]
*  And we've been to a lot of big concerts like this sounds like crap. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1482.0s)]
*  And this sucks because we know how good that band is. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1485.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter how good the music is. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1487.0s)]
*  If you can't understand or can't hear something, then it's pointless. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1489.0s)]
*  There's a lot of a lot of venues aren't really built for comedy or music where you have to end up playing to, which is kind of wild. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1493.0s)]
*  You know, like recently I went to some places and the venue just wasn't it's not the perfect venue, but it's the only one in that area that you can play. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1500.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've been to those where you walk in and the reverb in the rooms is ridiculous. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1509.0s)]
*  Yes. No, you're just going to blow these people's heads off as part of it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1514.0s)]

*  When it came to the name of the band, how did you guys figure that out? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1661.0s)]
*  Man, that story is not even that cool. You'd think it would be. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1665.0s)]
*  Well, Red Clay is all over Alabama. You get over anywhere over there. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1668.0s)]
*  I didn't like the name at first. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1673.0s)]
*  I don't think any of us liked any name we came up with. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1675.0s)]
*  What were some other options? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1677.0s)]
*  One of the band likes was Brandon Lane and the Hurricanes. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1679.0s)]
*  We on the Gulf Coast, we got Hurricanes. That's his middle name, Lane. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1682.0s)]
*  I love that. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1685.0s)]
*  I liked it too. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1687.0s)]
*  That'll be the alter ego. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1688.0s)]
*  No, but my brother came up with it just randomly. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1690.0s)]
*  Brandon Lane and the Hurricanes, Red Clay Stray. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1694.0s)]
*  We had the Dirt Leg Trio for a little while when it was just me, Brandon, and John. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1697.0s)]
*  The Dirt Leg Trio. We're from South Alabama. We don't like making up names. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1701.0s)]
*  Yeah, that one I think is a little bit, that's like a gangrene. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1705.0s)]
*  That feels more like an infection staff, the staff boys. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1709.0s)]
*  The staff boys. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1714.0s)]
*  Something I got from my job, it's like they wouldn't say, you redneck. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1716.0s)]
*  They'd say, you dirt leg. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1720.0s)]
*  Dirt leg, that's worse than redneck. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1721.0s)]
*  What is a dirt leg? And they're like, well, here's a redneck and then here's a dirt leg. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1722.0s)]
*  It's like trashier, worse of a person, steal from you, they're a dirt leg. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1726.0s)]
*  Damn. We would have somebody call, yeah, we'd call like a dirt serpent. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1732.0s)]
*  That's Kid Rock we call him. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1736.0s)]
*  I would say, yeah, I'd say Kid Rock falls in that dirt leg category. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1738.0s)]
*  I just described a lot of bad stuff. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1741.0s)]
*  I know, I'm just joking. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1744.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's more of a dirt serpent. He's like a leader of a club. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1746.0s)]
*  Yeah, you just had him not tell. Oh, there's a, whoa, he brought up the Urban Dictionary. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1751.0s)]
*  Dirt leg, a female looking for a quick fuck who only has enough time to take one pant leg off. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1755.0s)]
*  And that's where we came from. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1761.0s)]
*  Getting the other pant leg dirty. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1763.0s)]
*  All right. Dirt leg. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1766.0s)]
*  Yeah, they just put that TikTok ban into. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1769.0s)]
*  Yeah, we actually would on the way down here or on the way up here. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1772.0s)]
*  We actually just saw that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1775.0s)]
*  We got to see in that. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1776.0s)]
*  I've seen it on Instagram. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1778.0s)]
*  Yeah, we saw it on the news. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1779.0s)]
*  Let me see. Congress had passed the bill this week as part of a wide ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel and Ukraine. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1780.0s)]
*  It was approved by the House on Saturday and by the Senate on Tuesday. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1786.0s)]
*  And also had TikTok hidden in, is that what it's saying? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1789.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1791.0s)]
*  Welcome to our government. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1792.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1793.0s)]
*  They always be doing that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1794.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1795.0s)]
*  Ain't reading that fine print, people. Now we lost TikTok. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1796.0s)]
*  It's going to suck if it actually goes away though. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1798.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1800.0s)]
*  Man, there's got to be something behind it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1801.0s)]
*  Even our ban has grown so much from TikTok. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1802.0s)]
*  I don't even be ticking the talk. I'm not even on it. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1805.0s)]
*  It's fun. It's dangerous because you can get into a warp zone where you look up and suddenly your family hasn't eaten. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1808.0s)]
*  I could see that easily. Somebody scroll on TikTok and then they look up and their children haven't eaten. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1816.0s)]
*  That's what they need to scroll with. The death scroll. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1821.0s)]
*  Death scroll. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1824.0s)]
*  Instagram or TikTok. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1825.0s)]
*  See, I get all my reels from Instagram and my fiance gets mad because I'm like six months behind. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1826.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, y'all are behind over there. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1830.0s)]
*  I do the YouTube shorts too. That's my death scroll. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1831.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1834.0s)]
*  So I'm getting like eight months, nine months behind. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1835.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're in hospice. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1837.0s)]
*  The reason I like TikTok is you can ask him. All of my Instagram stuff is just messed up people. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1839.0s)]
*  We get dark. Our Instagram reels get dark. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1845.0s)]
*  People get in their motorcycle racks and just a lot of crazy stuff that I'm like, how's this on Instagram? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1847.0s)]
*  We done screwed our algorithms up. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1852.0s)]
*  But then TikTok is like, well, here's how you make a garden in your backyard or here's how you... [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1853.0s)]
*  For now until you get on the dark side of TikTok. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1856.0s)]
*  I haven't been on the dark side. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1859.0s)]
*  Damn, I don't want to get over there. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1860.0s)]
*  Don't start searching things. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1862.0s)]
*  What are some things? Look under some of my links. I have a couple of favorites that I've had on there recently. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1863.0s)]
*  Oh, here we go. Right here. Now this was something I saw. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1868.0s)]
*  How's a cat dog? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1871.0s)]
*  Is that a cat? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1881.0s)]
*  That's an odd way to explain what a cat is. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1882.0s)]
*  That thing ate a ruler, homie. That thing. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1884.0s)]
*  That's a different ethnicity of a cat. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1887.0s)]
*  Cat got your measuring stick, huh? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1889.0s)]
*  That thing is out of town. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1891.0s)]
*  That was a wiener dog at first. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1894.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. That's a damn wiener cat. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1896.0s)]
*  Wiener cat, dude. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1898.0s)]
*  Wiener cat, dude. You don't want to see our recent searches. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1899.0s)]
*  Really? It's getting pretty bad? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1902.0s)]
*  Well, those are just some of them. That's one of my faves. I'll go through a couple more. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1903.0s)]
*  What, the cat videos? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1907.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, we might as well enjoy TikTok while we got it because we ain't going to have it much longer. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1909.0s)]
*  And that's Asian guy walking with turtle and that's always a beautiful... [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1913.0s)]
*  That's really... [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1917.0s)]
*  It's a very wholesome algorithm. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1919.0s)]
*  That's like the notebook in Japan, dude. That video right there. It's their notebook. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1920.0s)]
*  What else do we have? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1926.0s)]
*  Aw, look at that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1929.0s)]
*  Oh, this guy's a little nativity scene on the go. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1931.0s)]
*  This is like DoorDash nativity scene. Play it one more time. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1933.0s)]
*  Is that all it is? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1935.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like 40 bucks. The dude pulls up. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1936.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1939.0s)]
*  Does he have like an actual little baby he could start using too for Christmas? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1941.0s)]
*  Oh, if his wife maybe. If he's probably got to ask his wife. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1945.0s)]
*  It reminds me of those booths at the fair. You pay like 20 bucks. Go see the snake lady. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1949.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1953.0s)]
*  You walk in and it's just like a... [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1954.0s)]
*  Well, we just had a carnival worker on and his grandfather was the great Lentini and he had three legs and two penises. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1956.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1965.0s)]
*  And... [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1966.0s)]

*  Wow. He's got his own Wikipedia. But wait, you said his dad? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1976.0s)]
*  The carnival worker that we had in named Mitch, he had a granddaddy. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1980.0s)]
*  Okay, because that guy was born in 1889. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1987.0s)]

*  Hmm. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1993.0s)]
*  Damn, Narnia probably. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1994.0s)]
*  That's the stuff you see in like the Marvel movies, though, man. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1996.0s)]
*  Dude, I bet that dude could run a foot race, play soccer. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=1999.0s)]
*  I bet he could climb up walls and stuff. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2002.0s)]

*  That's what I was going to say. I bet he lives in a web. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2006.0s)]
*  That would be, yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2008.0s)]
*  I can't think of one nude picture of this man. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2009.0s)]
*  I wonder what his attitude was. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2012.0s)]
*  You think he had like a temper when getting bar fights and just start kicking people? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2014.0s)]
*  That's a great call, huh? It would be crazy if you're standing there talking to him and then one of his foot just puts a cigarette into his mouth. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2018.0s)]
*  You know, this is what the UFC is missing right here. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2024.0s)]
*  It really is. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2027.0s)]
*  Maybe you think the weirdos like the people from Nick who have like feet things. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2028.0s)]

*  Now, didn't they ban all that? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2049.0s)]
*  He had one extra. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2050.0s)]
*  Didn't they ban like you can't show yourself off in carnivals and stuff? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2051.0s)]
*  Like freak shows? Did they ban them? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2055.0s)]
*  I think they did. It was considered inhumane. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2057.0s)]
*  Well, what if you like sign yourself up? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2059.0s)]
*  It didn't matter. They banned it anyway. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2062.0s)]
*  Freak shows remained popular until the 1940s when public opinion began to shift. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2064.0s)]
*  Throughout the 20th century, several federal laws made discrimination against people with physical disabilities illegal, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2068.0s)]
*  and the exhibition of extraordinary bodies was outlawed in some states. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2074.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2078.0s)]
*  Now, that seems a little prejudiced if you ask me. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2079.0s)]
*  What I read was the freaks in the freak shows got mad because they were like, this is how we make a living. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2080.0s)]
*  People paid to look at me, but I don't know how true that was. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2085.0s)]
*  Well, it's like the Redskins now having to probably change their name back because the natives got mad at them for changing it. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2088.0s)]
*  Oh, they did now? They got mad at them for changing it? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2094.0s)]
*  That's what I've read, yeah. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2096.0s)]
*  They're trying to change it back now? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2097.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2098.0s)]

*  I graduated college with the safety, Jeremy Reeves. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2105.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2108.0s)]
*  I did sports medicine in college, so I did some of his rehabilitation. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2109.0s)]
*  Damn, and is he healthy now? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2112.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he just came off an injury, but he's good. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2114.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2116.0s)]
*  Good enough to be playing with the Commandos. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2117.0s)]
*  Which who knows if that's good. We'll see. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2120.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2123.0s)]
*  Remains to be seen. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2124.0s)]
*  He's getting paid. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2125.0s)]
*  Yeah, which states outlawed those shows? That's kind of interesting. I wonder if it was like, who would do it? I wonder what states would do it, southern states or? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2126.0s)]
*  Well, I wonder if they looked at it as like you're just... [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2139.0s)]
*  It's hard to imagine the political demographic back then in the 40s. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2141.0s)]
*  I wonder if it's like you're bringing like... you can't really call them special. It's like handicapped people and making a show of them. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2144.0s)]
*  But what if they sign up and they want to make the show themselves? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2150.0s)]
*  Well, they have the same thing type of now where it's, you know, they have like a lot of people with what some people call disabilities have like shows on TikTok or social media channels. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2153.0s)]
*  TLC. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2168.0s)]
*  Yeah, TLC. Their whole network is based off of people with four necks or whatever, you know, or double, you know. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2169.0s)]
*  Do you ever watch My Strange Addiction? That was one I watched when I was younger. It would be like a lady drinking gasoline. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2179.0s)]
*  One lady liked to eat toilet paper. She ate the foam out the mattress. She was a big one too. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2186.0s)]
*  Went straight to her hips. She sure did. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2191.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2193.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2194.0s)]
*  Damn, boy. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2195.0s)]

*  Well, we spoke with a man the other day who ate glass. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2205.0s)]
*  Was it on the street or was it on the podcast? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2209.0s)]
*  I can't remember. But yeah, he's had a lot of it. You know, I don't like anything like that. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2211.0s)]
*  I wouldn't think so. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2221.0s)]

*  They must have been next to like one of those power plants. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2251.0s)]
*  It makes me wonder though, like, if it became illegal to like stare at freaks in a freak show, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2261.0s)]
*  but it's okay to go watch mentally handicapped people in the Olympics and stuff. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2271.0s)]
*  Why is one except on bull and one's not? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2277.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2279.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2281.0s)]
*  Is it just because one's doing sports and the other's just sitting on a couch? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2282.0s)]
*  Shoot juggling. I've seen some, probably seen him juggling. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2286.0s)]
*  Yeah, you would think I would like, that's a sport. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2289.0s)]
*  Dude, I think it's like, it doesn't even, people with handicaps are more, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2292.0s)]
*  like if you watch this show with dating under the influence of Down Syndrome or whatever, what is it called? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2296.0s)]
*  Down for love. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2304.0s)]

*  I've never watched it, but I've heard of it. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2309.0s)]
*  It's amazing, right? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2310.0s)]
*  And it's just like, it's people that have disabilities, some of them are Down Syndrome and they go on first dates, right? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2311.0s)]
*  And they start to learn relationships and they are just as awkward as anybody that doesn't have the disabilities, you know? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2316.0s)]
*  In fact, sometimes they are better at dating than people that have disabilities [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2325.0s)]
*  because they are a little bit more frank about what's going on. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2332.0s)]
*  A little more open, a little more bold about it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2336.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's fascinating, that show is fascinating. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2338.0s)]

*  Oh, it's done. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2397.0s)]
*  It's done. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2398.0s)]
*  It's ready to come out. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2399.0s)]
*  It's coming out here in the very near future. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2400.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2402.0s)]
*  Hopefully by the end of summertime. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2403.0s)]
*  How does that feel? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2405.0s)]
*  What's that, because that's really... [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2406.0s)]
*  I can't wait for people to hear it because it's just a lot better of an album than the first album as far as production goes. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2410.0s)]
*  We recorded it with Dave Cobb. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2417.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, Chris Stapleton. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2419.0s)]
*  He's done all our heroes. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2421.0s)]
*  It's been always a goal of ours to work with Dave since we very first started. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2425.0s)]
*  Yeah, there he is. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2430.0s)]
*  And now how does that come to pass that you guys get to match up with him? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2431.0s)]
*  Does he reach out to you? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2434.0s)]
*  Do you start to interview a series of producers? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2435.0s)]
*  No, we actually at the time we were looking up studios. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2440.0s)]
*  So we wanted to go to a studio where the Alabama Shakes recorded their first album. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2444.0s)]
*  I think it was called The Bomb Shelter. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2449.0s)]
*  Here in Nashville. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2450.0s)]
*  In Nashville. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2451.0s)]
*  And that was the plan until Brandon Moldin, who works with Conway Entertainment, which is where our manager works, made the connection. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2452.0s)]
*  He reached out to Dave for us and he was like, hey, we represent this band if you're interested in working with them. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2461.0s)]
*  And Dave knew who we were. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2467.0s)]
*  And so he was like, yeah, I'd love to work with them. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2468.0s)]
*  And then he set up a Zoom call with us and reached out and we talked to him that day. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2471.0s)]
*  We were actually on the way to a show. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2476.0s)]
*  We had to pull over on the side of the road and talk with them. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2478.0s)]
*  And so the van would make us a noise. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2481.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's so loud in there. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2484.0s)]
*  We were like, we stopped for some barbecue too. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2486.0s)]
*  So I'm like eating a barbecue sandwich talking to Dave. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2488.0s)]
*  But there was no service. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2490.0s)]
*  So we're like walking around trying to keep service during this because it's like we're talking to one of our heroes in the middle of Alabama in the middle of nowhere. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2491.0s)]
*  You're like, this guy can't even produce a call. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2498.0s)]
*  They're not going to make anything. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2500.0s)]
*  We were probably somewhere in Alabama too. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2502.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2504.0s)]
*  That had to be a pretty magical moment. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2505.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2507.0s)]
*  We didn't know how to feel about it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2508.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2509.0s)]
*  We're just we don't really like that. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2510.0s)]
*  The record, the first record that's out, like I cannot stand to go back and listen to it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2512.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2515.0s)]
*  At all. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2516.0s)]
*  It was such a cluster making that thing. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2517.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2520.0s)]
*  I like it for what it is. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2521.0s)]
*  Yeah, for what it is. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2522.0s)]
*  We just gotten out of another record deal that wasn't working for us. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2523.0s)]
*  And the only way to continue forward was to get out of it. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2528.0s)]
*  So we finally made it out of that thing and then just on our own, not knowing what to do. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2531.0s)]
*  And, you know, we go to this guy's studio in Huntsville. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2536.0s)]
*  Sink every dollar we had. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2541.0s)]
*  Go in the debt making it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2543.0s)]
*  And that's eventually we were still unhappy with it trying to make it. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2544.0s)]
*  But eventually we just had to, you know, call it quits and say it's done. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2548.0s)]
*  Was that because of money? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2552.0s)]
*  Like just had to call it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2553.0s)]
*  Yeah, money and time. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2554.0s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't put all this work in this window of time. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2556.0s)]
*  We opened up for it. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2558.0s)]
*  And we so this next one, though, I listen, we listen to it every day, I think. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2560.0s)]
*  And it's incredible. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2564.0s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't gotten tired of it yet. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2566.0s)]
*  We're ready to put that one out. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2568.0s)]
*  It's gonna should be pretty good. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2569.0s)]
*  Or the people hate it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2571.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2572.0s)]
*  I can't even imagine. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2573.0s)]
*  Because it yeah, when you're music come on, man, it just feels good. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2575.0s)]
*  Can we listen? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2578.0s)]
*  Can we listen? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2580.0s)]
*  Will you take me through who comes in on Wonder and Why like in the beginning, just in the beginning, so I know who the different because you guys have different band members. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2581.0s)]
*  I want to make sure that I get the gist. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2588.0s)]
*  Can you play it for us by chance? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2590.0s)]
*  Can you just play it through the you can play it to the speaker. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2592.0s)]
*  We can walk through the telly. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2595.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2596.0s)]
*  What song you want to do? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2597.0s)]
*  I'm wondering why. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2598.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is right here. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2599.0s)]
*  Can you just say I just want to know who comes in when right? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2600.0s)]
*  Because it starts off just with you singing. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2603.0s)]
*  Yeah, you probably won't hear it, but I'm in the right at the second verse. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2605.0s)]
*  First, first, first, but I just play bass. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2609.0s)]
*  It's not that big of a deal, you know, but you come in. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2611.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2615.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2616.0s)]
*  Well, I go to the court. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2617.0s)]

*  Low dollar. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2632.0s)]
*  Old boat paddle. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2633.0s)]
*  And here comes my big moment. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2634.0s)]
*  Right here. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2639.0s)]
*  One earlier cut used to have finger snaps right here. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2647.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2650.0s)]

*  And that's Zach in there. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2664.0s)]
*  Playing in the back of the park. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2667.0s)]
*  Which is right. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2670.0s)]

*  Got it. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2679.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2680.0s)]
*  I was just listening to the other. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2681.0s)]
*  And I was wondering, I was like, who's coming in when? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2682.0s)]
*  Just so I know who's doing what? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2685.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2687.0s)]
*  What's the collaborate collaborating like for an album? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2688.0s)]
*  Like, do you guys seem to like, does it get tough? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2691.0s)]
*  How, how is it like battling egos and stuff? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2694.0s)]
*  I guess at this point, if you spend that much time in a, like in that close of quarters, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2696.0s)]
*  you guys have got it figured out. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2704.0s)]
*  Oh, we're brothers, man. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2707.0s)]
*  We. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2708.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2709.0s)]
*  We used to, we would work up songs and in the earlier days, you know, we, we would get [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2710.0s)]
*  aggravated if we didn't want to take the song in our direction or my direction or Zach's [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2717.0s)]
*  direction or whatever. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2722.0s)]
*  But at somewhere along the line, I think we just, just got to a point where we realized [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2723.0s)]
*  at the end of the day, we all want the same thing is to make good music. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2728.0s)]
*  And so we try everything, you know, and there's always a, a way to make everybody happy as [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2732.0s)]
*  far as making music like that. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2739.0s)]
*  And we'll try everything, even if we have to play the song for eight or nine hours while [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2741.0s)]
*  we're working it up, just play it over and over again, all these different ways until [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2745.0s)]
*  we find the right way. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2749.0s)]
*  And there's not really any egos involved with that, you know? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2751.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2756.0s)]
*  I don't think a lot of bands are like that. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2757.0s)]
*  At least I wouldn't think so. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2758.0s)]
*  So we feel very fortunate. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2760.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2762.0s)]
*  I know when I met you guys, when I met you guys, we were in Virginia, Charlottesville, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2763.0s)]
*  maybe you were playing. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2767.0s)]
*  That's where you brought us out to your show up there. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2769.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2771.0s)]
*  You were where the heck were we? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2772.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2773.0s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2774.0s)]
*  Shoot. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2775.0s)]
*  I feel like I should have thought about it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2776.0s)]
*  I think it's Charlottesville. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2777.0s)]
*  It was Charlottesville. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2778.0s)]
*  But we came at the end and saw a couple of you guys, got to see a couple of the songs. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2779.0s)]
*  You were that, that goofy Jeff Gordon, Jack and I didn't believe you were going to show [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2782.0s)]
*  up. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2787.0s)]
*  He was probably going to come out and I was like, he was going to be way too busy to be [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2788.0s)]
*  worried about us. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2790.0s)]
*  Dude, I had so much fun. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2791.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, there we are. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2792.0s)]
*  But y'all's band, everybody, there was just, there was an energy in there. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2793.0s)]
*  You guys, we all sat in there and just chatted for a little while, but a lot of groups, it's [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2797.0s)]
*  not like that. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2801.0s)]
*  You'll meet a group of a band sometimes and it's not the same energy. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2806.0s)]
*  Dude, we live, we make each other laugh day in and day out. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2807.0s)]
*  You put five of us, the five of us with each other, we're going to just, we can't help [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2810.0s)]
*  but just crack up laughing. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2814.0s)]
*  Yeah, because our theme song on the podcast was made by a group called Bishop Gun. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2817.0s)]
*  Did you guys ever hear of them? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2823.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2824.0s)]
*  They're from South, they're not together anymore, but they were from South Mississippi. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2825.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2826.0s)]
*  And they really had a great start, you know, like they got to open up for the stuff. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2827.0s)]
*  I was watching you. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2831.0s)]
*  Oh, gang, dude. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2832.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2833.0s)]
*  They had us over their side stage. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2834.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2836.0s)]
*  We were there for like five minutes and we're like, we're like watching the clock. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2837.0s)]
*  Like we had to leave right at a certain time to get back to start our own show. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2841.0s)]
*  Oh, thanks, man. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2844.0s)]
*  We didn't want to leave, man. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2845.0s)]
*  That's... [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2846.0s)]
*  No, it got bad. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2847.0s)]
*  Did it? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2848.0s)]
*  It was fine. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2849.0s)]
*  We left at a good time. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2850.0s)]
*  Now we, we, it's funny because we don't really listen to much music as a, as a group. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2852.0s)]
*  Like when we come on the bus after a show, it's, it's comedy. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2855.0s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2858.0s)]
*  It's, it's Kill Tony's or somebody's stand up special. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2859.0s)]
*  Hey, Kill Tony's so great, man. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2862.0s)]
*  We actually saw a couple, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2864.0s)]
*  We went and saw Shane, Shane Gillis invited us out. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2868.0s)]
*  He put us up in the suite and everything. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2873.0s)]
*  And then we got to meet freaking Tony and Jeff Ross. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2875.0s)]
*  Tony was just standing outside smoking a cigarette and we walked up on him. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2879.0s)]
*  That dude's as goofy as you think he is. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2882.0s)]
*  That's what he's like, oh, hey guys. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2884.0s)]
*  Hey. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2886.0s)]
*  Had his big old Texas belt buckle on. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2887.0s)]
*  You ain't from here. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2889.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2890.0s)]
*  Tony is one of a kind, bro. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2892.0s)]
*  His show, they have like a hundred thousand people watching it at once when it comes on. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2894.0s)]
*  That's unprecedented in the world, I feel like. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2899.0s)]
*  I can't remember how we even discovered it, but it's, it's a, it's a real, it's real. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2902.0s)]
*  We watch it all the time on the bus. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2907.0s)]
*  It's just about every night after a show. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2909.0s)]
*  Kill Tony's coming on. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2911.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2912.0s)]
*  It is, man. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2913.0s)]
*  I think we're going to a Kill Tony in a couple, probably I think next month. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2914.0s)]
*  Yeah, you guys gonna head down to Austin? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2920.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna, yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2922.0s)]
*  We got, I think Tony invited us out to do a Kill Tony with him. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2923.0s)]
*  Really? I'll be there. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2925.0s)]
*  Yeah, come hang out with him. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2926.0s)]
*  Well, then we're gonna hang out with you. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2927.0s)]
*  It's gonna be a party then. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2928.0s)]
*  I think it's at Rogan's place, I'm not mistaken. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2929.0s)]
*  I don't know where to shoot it. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2931.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2932.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go down there for a couple weeks and work on some material. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2933.0s)]
*  You gonna be on the panel that night, you think? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2934.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2936.0s)]
*  They asked if we wanted to go on stage and I was like, no. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2937.0s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2939.0s)]
*  No, I wanna go watch. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2940.0s)]
*  I don't wanna get on stage. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2941.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2942.0s)]
*  I'm gonna start my feelings today. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2943.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2944.0s)]
*  Those poor guys, I've been doing comedy for 13 years and they just get roasted to hell. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2945.0s)]
*  It's like, dang. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2949.0s)]
*  Yeah, the balls that that takes. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2950.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2953.0s)]
*  Because it's so hard to make people laugh in a minute. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2954.0s)]
*  It would almost be like, hey guys, in one minute, make me believe that you are a good band. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2955.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't do that. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2961.0s)]
*  It'd be really hard. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2964.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2965.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2966.0s)]
*  I mean, you could do a couple riffs or whatever, but I feel like it'd be really tough. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2967.0s)]
*  That in comedy is just something I don't understand how to make. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2971.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2974.0s)]
*  I like sitting there watching it and wondering where a joke's gonna go and then the punch [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2975.0s)]
*  line comes in and just makes you roll while you're laughing. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2979.0s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2982.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't wanna go on Kill Tony just for that reason. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2984.0s)]
*  I'd be up there just, uh-oh, playing a band. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2988.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2991.0s)]
*  And just, I told Brandon, if he ever goes on, you just gotta go up there and sing for a [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2992.0s)]
*  minute. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2995.0s)]
*  That's all you got. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2996.0s)]
*  That's what you gotta do, bro. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2997.0s)]
*  I'm not even gonna tell you. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2998.0s)]
*  You just lean hard into it. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=2999.0s)]
*  Yeah, lean into what you do best, brother. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3000.0s)]
*  If they invite you to bring potatoes, bring potatoes, dude. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3002.0s)]
*  It's just that being a comedian seems, man, it's like we have music to hide behind and [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3005.0s)]
*  we have the five of us up, or six of us up there to hide behind and we have each other [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3010.0s)]
*  when you're like watching, especially watching you and Shane, it's like you're up there by [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3014.0s)]
*  yourself, man. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3018.0s)]
*  You're out in the abyss. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3019.0s)]
*  That's what's so fascinating about it. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3020.0s)]
*  You're floating around hoping people laugh or, you know, get what they paid for. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3021.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think we couldn't do it with, I think the hardest thing I think to do is [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3025.0s)]
*  that improv where people are working with other people, you know, that's the thing to [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3028.0s)]
*  me that seems like it's really the toughest. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3032.0s)]
*  I, that's where I like I've tried to take improv classes and stuff and I was not good [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3034.0s)]
*  at it in Los Angeles. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3039.0s)]
*  You weren't good at improv. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3041.0s)]
*  It was so hard, man. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3042.0s)]
*  It was like, cause it's just, you're so used as a comedian, you're so used to just, yeah, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3043.0s)]
*  I was just so used to like controlling things myself. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3049.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3052.0s)]
*  You know, that I would just, I don't know. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3053.0s)]
*  It was hard to do it with somebody else, I guess, to trust that somebody else, it was [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3055.0s)]
*  going to work well, you know. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3060.0s)]
*  It's kind of that. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3062.0s)]
*  Probably chemistry too though. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3064.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3065.0s)]
*  There's a surreal moment for even us. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3066.0s)]
*  It's like, it's hard to believe that people are coming to see you do what you do. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3067.0s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3071.0s)]
*  And it doesn't feel right. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3072.0s)]
*  One time I was stuck in traffic. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3073.0s)]
*  We were coming back from the YMCA from working out for a show and I was like, man, what the [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3074.0s)]
*  fuck, dude, this fucking town. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3078.0s)]
*  And it was traffic for my own. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3080.0s)]
*  Coming to you. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3082.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3083.0s)]
*  And the driver goes, dude, these people are going to see you. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3084.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3088.0s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, man. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3089.0s)]
*  You're complaining about the traffic. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3090.0s)]
*  See, that's when we, these people are awesome. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3091.0s)]
*  That's one of our goals when you've made is when you can shut down the damn freeway outside [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3093.0s)]
*  of the arena. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3098.0s)]
*  That's when you make it. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3099.0s)]
*  That's how we felt pulling up to your show with all that traffic. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3100.0s)]
*  Dude, it was like, are we even going to have time to get in? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3102.0s)]
*  We're like sitting in traffic. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3104.0s)]
*  We get out and just start walking. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3106.0s)]
*  The Uber's just like, we're just get out here. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3107.0s)]
*  And we just started walking down the sidewalk. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3109.0s)]
*  Literally the red clay strays, dude. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3111.0s)]
*  You guys are just wandering around. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3112.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3114.0s)]
*  I think we're in a cool spot right now to where it's like, we definitely get noticed [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3115.0s)]
*  a lot now, but it's still hit or miss in some places. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3119.0s)]
*  So especially if I wear a hat. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3122.0s)]
*  It's like an imposter syndrome for us too. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3124.0s)]
*  Like just, it doesn't make sense to us why people like what we don't feel. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3127.0s)]
*  I mean, we feel what we do is half ass mediocre, you know, it's just like, you could go spend [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3132.0s)]
*  your time and money on a lot better things. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3137.0s)]
*  Well, people, but even talking to me about the number of shows you guys did last year, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3140.0s)]
*  I mean, that, you know, the only person I've heard talk that's done that many shows was [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3144.0s)]
*  Lainey Wilson last year did a lot of shows. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3148.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3151.0s)]
*  I mean, she was, you know, I started at the end of the year and I was like, man, she is [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3152.0s)]
*  gone. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3156.0s)]
*  She's, it just hasn't ended. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3157.0s)]
*  You know, you have to, I think that's where you, you know, I think that's where the boys [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3159.0s)]
*  and the men are separated. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3163.0s)]
*  It's not about being the best. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3164.0s)]
*  It's not about being the best. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3165.0s)]
*  It's not about, it's about literally just going and doing it. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3166.0s)]
*  If you can stick through it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3171.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3172.0s)]
*  Resiliency for sure. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3173.0s)]
*  And then I think like even with Bishop Gunn, they had like addiction, they had like some [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3174.0s)]
*  addiction issues in the bank, like that kind of stuff tore them, you know. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3178.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3182.0s)]
*  I mean, we've seen that not with ourselves, but it's so easy being on the road. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3183.0s)]
*  How you can, I mean, you probably see it with comedy, how you can easily turn to those things. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3186.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3190.0s)]
*  It's a dark hole. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3191.0s)]
*  You don't want to go down. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3192.0s)]
*  We've always. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3193.0s)]
*  It's not the seventies anymore. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3194.0s)]
*  And the whole sex drugs and rock and roll thing is kind of a, you know, what's the word [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3195.0s)]
*  I'm looking for? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3202.0s)]
*  Like, like a thing in the past. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3203.0s)]
*  It's like a stereo. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3206.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3207.0s)]
*  Everybody look from the outside, looking in, they think that's what it's like. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3208.0s)]
*  And it's not really like that anymore. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3210.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3212.0s)]
*  And we've always made it clear, like, you know, everybody has their struggles and whatever [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3213.0s)]
*  you're going to do, but don't let it get in the way of this. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3217.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3222.0s)]
*  If you're struggling with alcohol, not to say that any of us do, but just in the sense [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3223.0s)]
*  of, if you are struggling with something, stay sober for an hour and a half a night [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3228.0s)]
*  to play the show. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3232.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3233.0s)]
*  And then these people pay money and they take their time out of their day or their schedule [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3234.0s)]
*  to come see you. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3237.0s)]
*  And you're going to get on stage too messed up to perform. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3238.0s)]
*  That's, that's not cool with me or not cool with any of us. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3241.0s)]
*  So that's, we also, it's always been a strict rule with us. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3244.0s)]
*  I think like we're talking earlier, us five are so close to each other. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3246.0s)]
*  We're like brothers. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3249.0s)]
*  We're like brothers. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3250.0s)]
*  When somebody slips, Pat corrects and you know, we've really got, oh yeah, we've all gotten [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3251.0s)]
*  our ass chewed after a show or two. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3255.0s)]
*  That's pretty fortunate then that you guys are able to have that symbiosis or whatever [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3257.0s)]
*  within your group, you know? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3262.0s)]
*  Oh, we want the best for each other and we all love each other very much. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3263.0s)]
*  We all recognize that we're doing something bigger than ourselves. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3266.0s)]
*  If you're worrying about yourself and what you're, what you want to do or how you've [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3269.0s)]
*  been done wrong, then you're going to find all kinds of excuses to get mad or to quit [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3273.0s)]
*  or to argue or fight with somebody. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3279.0s)]
*  But if you keep it selfless instead of selfish, that's where you can find fulfillment and [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3281.0s)]
*  the strength to keep going, I guess. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3291.0s)]
*  And I think a part of that was our come up meeting some of our heroes and realizing these [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3292.0s)]
*  guys are not cool. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3297.0s)]
*  And that's how we don't want to ever treat other people or treat our own crew, let alone [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3299.0s)]
*  each other. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3305.0s)]
*  So yeah, just seeing that kind of stuff on different festivals or different things like [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3306.0s)]
*  that. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3309.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3311.0s)]
*  You run into some, I mean, we've met some people that you think would be douchebags [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3312.0s)]
*  and they're cool as hell. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3313.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3314.0s)]
*  And that's always cool. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3315.0s)]
*  You know, it's like meeting you, you could have been an asshole to us, you know? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3318.0s)]
*  You kind of were, but yeah, that's okay. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3319.0s)]
*  We're here, you know, I had to be, I guess. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3322.0s)]
*  What did I do something bad? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3324.0s)]
*  Oh, you wear that Jeff Gordon jacket. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3326.0s)]
*  That was, that was problem one. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3329.0s)]
*  That'll turn some people off. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3330.0s)]
*  Man, I made you take it off. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3331.0s)]
*  I got to pee really fast guys. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3333.0s)]
*  You got to pee? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3334.0s)]
*  Anybody else? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3335.0s)]
*  I got to pee. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3336.0s)]
*  I got to pee. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3337.0s)]
*  You remember the first song you ever heard? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3338.0s)]
*  I remember the first song. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3341.0s)]
*  Sorry, I'm a little out of breath going up the stairs. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3344.0s)]
*  The first song I remember singing was a song by Tracy Byrd called We're From the Country [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3348.0s)]
*  and we like it that way. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3354.0s)]
*  Everybody knows everybody. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3356.0s)]
*  Everybody calls your friend. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3358.0s)]
*  That was a good song, huh? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3361.0s)]
*  Don't need an invitation. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3363.0s)]
*  Kick off your shoes and come on in. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3365.0s)]

*  We're from the country and we like it that way. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3372.0s)]
*  How old were you when you sang that? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3375.0s)]
*  I had probably four or five years old. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3377.0s)]
*  And were you singing to the family? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3380.0s)]
*  Were you performing for someone or were you just sitting somewhere just singing that? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3381.0s)]
*  I've always, my mama told me even before I could talk, I'd walk around just going, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3384.0s)]
*  I'd go, ne, na, ne, na. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3391.0s)]
*  Already on the vocal warmups. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3394.0s)]
*  Okay, so. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3395.0s)]
*  But I've always, yeah, just always been a songbird I guess. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3396.0s)]
*  I remember having the little radio off of Toy Story with the microphone. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3400.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3405.0s)]
*  I was just dragging the radio around and it took a cassette tape and so I'd have the Tracy Byrd cassette tape in there and just, yeah. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3406.0s)]
*  Oh dude, gosh, I just brought back some memories. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3414.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3418.0s)]
*  That looks like Sketch who was just on here. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3419.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3422.0s)]
*  Maybe that's what he basses, bass it off of. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3424.0s)]
*  What's up brother? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3426.0s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3427.0s)]
*  Yeah, what's up? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3429.0s)]

*  Oh yeah, we've gotta send him one. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3431.0s)]
*  Will you write that down Ben? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3433.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3435.0s)]
*  What was that sound you made again? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3436.0s)]
*  Ne, na, ne, na. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3439.0s)]
*  It reminds me of Squid Games kind of. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3443.0s)]
*  I did not like that show. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3447.0s)]
*  You didn't? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3449.0s)]
*  No, that freaked me out a little bit. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3450.0s)]
*  I'm a grown man. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3451.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little freaky. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3452.0s)]
*  A lot of, yeah, I don't, look, yeah, I got some Japanese friends and they're prone to violence at times, you know. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3453.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3460.0s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3461.0s)]
*  Oh, they liked, yeah, they're really, cause they keep a lot of their feelings in. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3462.0s)]
*  And so the only, they. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3466.0s)]
*  Well, that's like the way of the ninja though, right? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3469.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3470.0s)]
*  They just busted a dude with a samurai sword out there grilling meat. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3471.0s)]
*  Where was that at? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3474.0s)]
*  Sounds like Florida. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3475.0s)]
*  Um. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3476.0s)]
*  Samurai sword and grilling meat. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3477.0s)]
*  Yeah, this man, man grilling in shopping cart used sword as skewer arrested near Santa Monica. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3479.0s)]
*  Well, he didn't try to stab nobody. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3484.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3486.0s)]
*  This guy is video from the Citizen app captured the wild scene before 3 p.m. on Sunday. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3487.0s)]
*  The man is seen dragging a shopping cart through a bike lane. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3493.0s)]
*  That looks like California. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3496.0s)]
*  The, the, the main compartment of the car is filled with flaming wood while the man uses a sword as a skewer to hold meat over the flames. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3498.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3505.0s)]
*  You can't, if you have so many people who are without homes, right, they're going to start to open up, um, barbacoas or whatever this is called. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3506.0s)]
*  You know, they're going to start to open up hair cutting. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3516.0s)]
*  I get my haircut when I'm in L.A. by a guy who is a street man. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3519.0s)]
*  Street man. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3525.0s)]
*  But he makes a living cutting hair. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3526.0s)]
*  He makes a living cutting hair. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3528.0s)]
*  This dude, Dreamer, he's Native American, actually. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3529.0s)]
*  That's a, that right there, that's a food truck, well, food cart, but same concept. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3531.0s)]
*  It's the same concept. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3535.0s)]
*  And yeah, sure. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3536.0s)]
*  Maybe it's FDA approved. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3537.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3539.0s)]
*  Um, it, people is still society. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3540.0s)]
*  They're still going to start a civil, you know what I'm saying? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3543.0s)]
*  Like everybody's going to start a civilization. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3545.0s)]
*  And so if they don't have money to pay permits for food trucks or, or whatever else, they're just going to. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3548.0s)]
*  That machete is that man's permit. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3554.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to resort to whatever they can. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3555.0s)]
*  They're going to figure out. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3557.0s)]
*  And I think we got to put more swords on the streets. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3558.0s)]
*  I bet that's some of the best barbecue you probably ever had too. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3560.0s)]
*  Oh, samurai sword. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3563.0s)]
*  Yeah, Sam. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3565.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3566.0s)]
*  Willy's samurai barbecue or whatever. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3567.0s)]
*  What do you think that meat is? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3569.0s)]
*  He probably did not buy that at the grocery store. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3570.0s)]
*  Damn, dude, I think that's damn. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3572.0s)]
*  He's got some of them Cali raccoons. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3574.0s)]
*  I don't know what they got out there. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3576.0s)]
*  Oh, I think that's probably braised human, bro. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3577.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3580.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3581.0s)]
*  You don't know when you're getting it out of a shopping cart. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3582.0s)]
*  Dude, it's look, obviously. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3585.0s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3587.0s)]
*  The shopping cart will make you think that it is. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3588.0s)]
*  Grocery store quality. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3590.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3591.0s)]
*  So really, they guys got a great concept. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3592.0s)]
*  Really, it's a grocery store manager quality. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3594.0s)]
*  Where does some of you guys' influence come with music? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3596.0s)]
*  What are you guys listening to right now? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3600.0s)]
*  What am I listening to right now? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3602.0s)]
*  I've been listening to Lake Street Dive a lot lately. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3605.0s)]
*  We just saw them at Mooncrush. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3607.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3608.0s)]
*  They're incredible. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3609.0s)]
*  Lake Street Dive, you never heard of them? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3610.0s)]
*  Oh, they're incredible. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3612.0s)]
*  Put me on, put me on. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3613.0s)]
*  Always been a huge fan of them, and then seeing them live just kind of reignited that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3615.0s)]
*  So I've just been on a Lake Street Dive kick for the last few days. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3619.0s)]
*  Our listeners. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3623.0s)]
*  Her vocals are just insane. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3625.0s)]
*  I love that organ player, man, when he sings. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3627.0s)]
*  I mean, they're like, it's like the 70s, modern day 70s music right there. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3630.0s)]
*  It is incredible, especially live. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3635.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3637.0s)]
*  Really, really good. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3638.0s)]
*  Lake Street Dive. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3639.0s)]
*  I got obsessed with trying to do vibrato because I can't do it. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3640.0s)]
*  I couldn't do it at all, but now I can kind of do it. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3646.0s)]
*  But she was one of the ones that I would listen to trying to figure that out, how to do that with your voice. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3649.0s)]
*  Still can't do it that well, but I'm trying my best. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3654.0s)]
*  So a singer will learn different tricks from other singers kind of, or not tricks, or just manipulations or ways to perform kind of? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3658.0s)]
*  I just learn by listening. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3665.0s)]
*  If I listen to Lake Street Dive or listen to Waylon or whatever I'm listening to long enough, I'll start to kind of mimic that on stage a little bit. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3667.0s)]
*  So how I sing at whatever show I'm at depends on what I've been listening to for the past few days, I guess. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3679.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's something about that about being an entertainer. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3686.0s)]
*  Part of you wants to, especially if you're staying open to things, you're going to be kind of a sponge in a way. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3692.0s)]
*  You may, if you've been absorbing one thing, then the next time you perform, there could be some of that just in your energy. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3699.0s)]
*  You want to be kind of a conduit for good energy. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3710.0s)]
*  And a lot of creativity and music, art is good energy usually. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3713.0s)]
*  Do you see that in comedy at all? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3717.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3718.0s)]
*  If you watch too much of one guy, you kind of start taking that personality on? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3719.0s)]
*  Oh, I'll watch some Chris Rock and I'll go out there and be like, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3724.0s)]
*  This guy loves some Chris Rock. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3727.0s)]
*  So yeah, that'll happen. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3732.0s)]
*  Oh, every comedian, when they started out, at my time, everybody sounded just like Mitch Hedberg. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3735.0s)]
*  All the people that were booking clubs, all the bookers were like, yeah, everybody right now sounds like Mitch Hedberg. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3740.0s)]
*  It's just because he's so popular right now. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3748.0s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of that that happens. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3750.0s)]
*  That's the guy who yells, right? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3752.0s)]
*  He would be like, no, that was... [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3754.0s)]
*  Who am I thinking of? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3756.0s)]
*  Oh, you're thinking of... [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3758.0s)]
*  He died a long time ago. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3759.0s)]
*  Yep. You're thinking of Sam... [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3761.0s)]
*  I like this game. No, it's fun. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3765.0s)]
*  Sam... [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3767.0s)]
*  Don't ruin it, man. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3768.0s)]
*  Kenison. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3769.0s)]
*  Yeah, Kenison. That's it. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3770.0s)]
*  Sam Kenison. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3771.0s)]
*  That guy was hilarious too. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3772.0s)]
*  Well, he had a crazy story with this guy, Karl LeBoeuf. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3773.0s)]
*  Can you bring this up? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3776.0s)]
*  So Karl LeBoeuf... [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3778.0s)]
*  RIP to him till he passed away. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3782.0s)]
*  Really funny, sweet guy. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3785.0s)]
*  I never knew Sam or met him. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3787.0s)]
*  But they had a... [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3789.0s)]
*  One of them had a daughter. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3791.0s)]
*  Can you bring it up? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3793.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3794.0s)]
*  The late comedian Sam Kenison left his friend and fellow comedian quite a belated surprise. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3796.0s)]
*  Karl LeBoeuf says that Sam was the real father of the daughter he thought was his. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3802.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3806.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3807.0s)]
*  We heard about it on the Joy Behar show where LeBoeuf said he found out that Sam was the father after Sam died. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3808.0s)]
*  So yeah, Karl had raised her her whole life and then found out that Sam was the father. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3813.0s)]
*  This is with his wife? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3819.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think there was a rumor that the child was conceived while he was on stage one time. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3821.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3826.0s)]
*  That is some disrespect. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3827.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's craft services and then there's craft services. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3829.0s)]
*  I was devastated. Karl said we're talking about at the same time of 14 year friendship, we started out together. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3833.0s)]
*  So we had survived living on the streets. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3839.0s)]
*  You know what it's like to start on comedy. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3841.0s)]
*  I mean, we stole fruit from the bars at night just to eat and slept in my car and we survived for a very long time. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3843.0s)]
*  And then with the Rodney Dangerfield special, it changed our lives. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3849.0s)]
*  And of course, Sam became huge and I was the head writer and his best friend. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3853.0s)]
*  We never lived more than a mile apart. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3856.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3858.0s)]
*  And then he slept with his wife. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3859.0s)]
*  Yep. And he was sleeping with his wife. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3860.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Yeah. What does it say happen? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3861.0s)]
*  You can say best friend and do that. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3863.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3865.0s)]
*  That's what's wild. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3866.0s)]
*  So I called my ex to explain to her that I was having a tough time and that's when she told me that Sam had fathered my child. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3867.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3873.0s)]
*  Huh. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3874.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3875.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3877.0s)]
*  Karl Lebov had not been able to legally establish that Sam Kinison was the child's father in court because all the blood tests proved that she was related to the Kinison family. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3878.0s)]
*  Now with the DNA test, he has definitive proof that Sam was the father. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3887.0s)]
*  Wow. That had to be so wild. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3891.0s)]
*  I wonder what his thoughts were. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3893.0s)]
*  It's like because his best friend died. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3894.0s)]
*  And so that's normally something you would be mad about, you know, him sleeping with your wife. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3897.0s)]
*  But at the same time, it's like he left you a little part of himself to raise. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3903.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3908.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3909.0s)]
*  It's almost a story out of the Bible almost, it seems like, you know, in a way. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3912.0s)]
*  In a way of like, you know, like, or maybe not out of the Bible, but it's like one of those ASAPs fables or something, something where you like learn like a lesson learning story. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3913.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3920.0s)]
*  Because that'd be crazy. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3921.0s)]
*  You would hate him. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3922.0s)]
*  You'd be angry at the wife, but then you'd also have something that you cared about for so long. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3923.0s)]
*  So did he didn't learn that until the death? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3929.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3933.0s)]
*  He didn't learn it until like way after the death. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3934.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3936.0s)]
*  I think till the, yeah, I think the daughter. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3937.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3938.0s)]
*  You have to look at that child a little different too. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3939.0s)]
*  That's not your blood anymore. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3941.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3942.0s)]
*  I wonder if that starts to happen inside of you. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3943.0s)]
*  But you also had that connection like an adopt a child. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3945.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3948.0s)]
*  And that probably wouldn't disappear, I think. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3949.0s)]
*  I've seen mixed emotions from different videos. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3950.0s)]
*  Like some men are like, it doesn't matter. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3954.0s)]
*  That's my kid. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3955.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3956.0s)]
*  And then some men are like, well, that's not my kid anymore. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3957.0s)]
*  I don't know how I'd feel in that situation. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3958.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3960.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3961.0s)]
*  One guy I saw was playing hit the road jack on his phone after he found out. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3962.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3965.0s)]
*  He was like pretty excited. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3966.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3967.0s)]
*  Depends on the man, I guess. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=3968.0s)]

*  And you introduced them to me. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4027.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4028.0s)]
*  Jay Roddy Walston and the business. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4029.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4030.0s)]
*  Maybe I like that. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4031.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4032.0s)]
*  That's some cool stuff. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4033.0s)]
*  I don't know if you ever listened to Alabama Shakes. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4034.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4035.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4036.0s)]
*  I hate that they're not a band anymore. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4037.0s)]
*  That's one that we looked up to. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4038.0s)]
*  What happened to them? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4039.12s)]
*  Well, I think there's some, we read some dark stuff about one of the members in the band [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4040.12s)]
*  and I think that probably led to the downfall. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4044.44s)]
*  I don't, I don't know how true that was though. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4046.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4048.4s)]
*  We don't know if true, but I think they are a band like we are that started together equal, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4049.4s)]
*  a lot of bands nowadays are built around a star or a singer. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4053.8s)]
*  I don't think they were one that started together and ended up breaking up together. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4057.88s)]
*  More of a constellation. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4060.48s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4061.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4062.48s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4063.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4064.48s)]
*  What happened in 2018? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4065.48s)]
*  The band went on hiatus due to Howard's focus on her solo project, Jamie. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4066.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4070.6000000000004s)]
*  She's done a bunch of stuff after that. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4071.6000000000004s)]
*  Which led to a solo tour in 2019. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4072.6000000000004s)]
*  Howard released her second solo album in 2024. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4074.44s)]
*  In June, 2020, guitarist Heath Fogg released his debut solo project under the name Sun. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4077.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not familiar with any of that, but Alabama Shakes was incredible. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4082.96s)]
*  And was that all the members of Alabama Shakes? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4086.2400000000002s)]
*  What's that? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4088.48s)]
*  Those people right there? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4089.48s)]
*  Some of them. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4090.48s)]
*  That's part of the band. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4091.48s)]
*  So some of them, they obviously just, some of them went their own separate ways. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4092.48s)]
*  Something must have happened and then went their own separate ways. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4094.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4095.4s)]
*  Or she wanted to do her solo stuff, which is... [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4096.400000000001s)]
*  That sounds like it. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4097.400000000001s)]
*  Man, that's the scary part, you know? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4098.76s)]
*  Well, that's what's interesting about the ego. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4100.68s)]
*  The ego, you don't know how it's going to grow. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4102.68s)]
*  It grows like a moss, man. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4104.68s)]
*  I could see myself doing solo stuff one day, but I'm not going to quit Red Clay Strayz, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4107.32s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4112.719999999999s)]
*  Yes, hers was more of a quit. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4113.719999999999s)]
*  Never came back to it. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4115.4s)]
*  Like that band Need to Breathe, you know who I'm talking about? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4116.84s)]
*  That's another one to listen to. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4120.48s)]
*  Ben knows. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4121.48s)]
*  Their lead singer does a project called Wilder Woods, and he goes and does Wilder Woods stuff [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4124.12s)]
*  and he still does Need to Breathe stuff. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4129.48s)]
*  This is just if I ever get extra time on my hands and just want to start other projects, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4132.24s)]
*  I could see myself doing it, but definitely wouldn't. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4136.24s)]
*  Need to Breathe. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4139.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're great. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4140.679999999999s)]
*  Brandon actually showed me them too. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4141.679999999999s)]
*  That's, I would say, have a pretty similar... [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4143.5599999999995s)]
*  We have a similar sound to them, I would say. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4147.08s)]
*  I grew up listening to them. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4149.719999999999s)]
*  That's definitely somebody that I started trying to mimic, learning how to sing. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4151.32s)]
*  You got a very powerful, loud voice, and that's how I started singing everything. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4156.719999999999s)]
*  Everything was very powerful and very loud. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4162.5599999999995s)]
*  And then getting into, I guess diving deeper into it, starting to learn technique and how [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4164.759999999999s)]
*  to use your voice and stuff. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4171.04s)]
*  And then I wanted to learn how to sing like opera singers with vibrato and stuff. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4172.04s)]
*  So it just depends on who I'm listening to. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4176.08s)]
*  And would you sing... [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4180.799999999999s)]
*  So after you was rattling around the house, mimicking and learning some, you know, and [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4181.799999999999s)]
*  running your pipes, you know, like, did you start to sing in church or what is that like? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4188.92s)]
*  Like where'd you start singing? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4193.0s)]
*  Can you? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4194.0s)]
*  Yeah, I started singing. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4195.0s)]
*  How'd you start to sing? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4196.0s)]
*  Yeah, where'd you start singing at? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4197.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was the first place I ever sang in front of a crowd was at church. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4198.0s)]
*  Yeah, I started playing drums in church when I was like 12. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4202.16s)]
*  That's a dangerous move, usually. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4206.24s)]
*  Did they put you in that little shed or whatever behind that thing? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4208.32s)]
*  No, I hate those things. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4210.8s)]
*  I do too. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4211.8s)]
*  Yeah, usually the church always puts that guy back there behind that little aquarium. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4212.8s)]
*  It depends on the church you go to. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4215.32s)]
*  Now the ones that Brandon was in, they're in there joking. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4217.16s)]
*  It's not contemporary. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4220.76s)]
*  All the churches are moving that way where they want to shield everything and have all [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4223.84s)]
*  of the actual sounds of the instruments coming through the PA system. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4228.36s)]
*  And it's like, I want to feel the sound waves, man. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4231.56s)]
*  I want to go out, just let the drummer play, let the guitar player play. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4234.08s)]
*  I want to get hit by a damn drum stick in there. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4237.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's how you get into it. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4240.32s)]
*  I actually had to go to, it was Brandon was playing in the church and John, our drummer, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4242.12s)]
*  John was playing drums in the church. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4248.16s)]
*  This was probably four or five years ago. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4249.28s)]
*  And I grew up in a Catholic church and it's, you walk in with a tie on and the organs playing [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4251.36s)]
*  and congregations singing. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4256.5599999999995s)]
*  I come in there and they are in there throwing down. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4258.6s)]
*  At his church? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4260.96s)]
*  I thought it was a WWE match. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4261.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4263.36s)]
*  And I had to bring John's snare drum. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4264.36s)]
*  He asked me to bring his drum and I'm like in shorts. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4265.72s)]
*  I didn't know what I was coming to. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4267.68s)]
*  It's such a, it's a wild different environment, but I mean you feel the Holy Spirit moving [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4270.200000000001s)]
*  in a bunch of different ways. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4274.96s)]
*  So there's a lot of energy in there. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4275.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4276.96s)]
*  That's why I've always liked Pentecostal. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4277.96s)]
*  Pentecostal? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4278.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4279.96s)]
*  Yeah, baby. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4280.96s)]
*  I'm more non-nominational because I don't really, the Baptist, the Pentecostal, the [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4281.96s)]
*  Catholic, this is all preference based in my opinion. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4285.400000000001s)]
*  But I do like a Pentecostal church because I zone out so easily and I'll lose attention. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4288.76s)]
*  And if I got somebody up there screaming at me and, you know, stomping his feet and getting [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4294.84s)]
*  into it like a performance pretty much, it keeps my attention. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4299.12s)]
*  I love that. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4303.24s)]
*  And my pastor, he was like 72 at the time. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4304.24s)]
*  He'd be running across the pews, running over the top of them and just feeling it, man. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4306.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4311.84s)]
*  It's just something that keeps your attention the whole time. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4312.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4314.68s)]
*  Do you think that's had an effect on how you perform kind of? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4315.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say so. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4318.5199999999995s)]
*  The church he's talking about is where I was going as an adult. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4320.28s)]
*  The church I grew up in was more of a, still a Pentecostal church, but it was more of a [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4323.12s)]
*  smaller building and a lot of older people were there and just the old country, southern [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4327.36s)]
*  country church, I guess. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4335.08s)]
*  It wasn't a lot of energy until I started playing drums there. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4336.08s)]
*  Brandon brought the Holy Spirit back in there. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4340.04s)]
*  Did that change the vibe in there a little? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4342.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was literally just, at the time, it was literally just the pastor with no amp [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4343.96s)]
*  or anything, just playing his acoustics, singing hymnals. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4349.2s)]
*  And then I started playing drums and then they had a keyboard player and that's, I guess [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4352.68s)]
*  I started doing that around when I was like 12 and played in there all the way up through [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4358.4400000000005s)]
*  high school before I started going on the road and being gone all the time. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4363.6s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4368.96s)]
*  That church, especially if you've got a church that's got a feeling in it, that's why I remember [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4370.72s)]
*  the first time I went to black churches, man. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4374.4800000000005s)]
*  Them things were different. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4376.320000000001s)]
*  I've been looking for a good black church to sit in. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4378.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, I see a lot of similarity in the church like Brandon's talking about. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4380.12s)]
*  They're in there getting down, the preacher's up there, really preaching and throwing energy [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4383.96s)]
*  into it. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4388.68s)]
*  The music's bumping and jiving. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4389.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4392.28s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4393.28s)]
*  Yeah, I love that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4394.28s)]
*  Well, there's definitely something, I mean, even if you look at Tony Robbins, he jumps [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4396.12s)]
*  on his trampoline before he goes on stage. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4401.0s)]
*  Like there's something- [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4403.8s)]
*  Get that adrenaline going. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4404.8s)]
*  To get just his like, I think he says it's to get like the lymph in his body, like basically [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4406.6s)]
*  just to get the, it's like shaking the snow globe, baby. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4411.280000000001s)]
*  You want some weather, you just want nothing. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4415.88s)]
*  So you got to start your own weather a lot of times. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4418.84s)]
*  Hop on that trampoline. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4422.160000000001s)]
*  And a lot of times the Holy Spirit or whatever, that feeling you get, I feel that a lot on [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4423.160000000001s)]
*  stage and that's what I project a lot of times singing. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4428.360000000001s)]
*  Just to see that in a pastor, feeling that passion and to make him raise his voice or [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4433.4s)]
*  to make him stomp his foot. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4438.32s)]
*  He's up there in the moment, he's feeling it and that just keeps you drawn in the whole [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4441.04s)]
*  time. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4445.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4446.4s)]
*  Yeah, man, I need to find some good churches that have stuff like that. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4447.4s)]
*  I thought of- [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4450.56s)]
*  That's the South, I think, just in general with churches. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4451.56s)]
*  I would love to one day maybe end up in a road like that. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4455.32s)]
*  There's some moments on stage where I feel a little bit like a pastor. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4459.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that weird to say that? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4462.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean, you're up there with a microphone. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4463.5199999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't say so. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4464.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4465.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't feel like in the sense that I'm like some- [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4466.5199999999995s)]
*  Like a spiritual leader. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4468.5199999999995s)]
*  Right, no. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4470.12s)]
*  But I do feel that in a sense like, oh, I wonder if there's part of me that has this [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4471.16s)]
*  calling a little bit. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4475.48s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4476.88s)]
*  It's like a little bit of energy goes through me and like, it's even a moment where it's [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4477.88s)]
*  when I'm talking about God in this one bit and I'm like, wonder why does this bit stand [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4481.679999999999s)]
*  out to me so much? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4487.179999999999s)]
*  Or I wonder- [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4488.679999999999s)]
*  That could be the Holy Spirit talking to you. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4489.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, at least whispering. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4491.599999999999s)]
*  At least whispering. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4492.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think God gives you a platform and it's a constant trade-off. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4493.599999999999s)]
*  God raises you up and gives you a platform and then you turn around and give it back [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4498.32s)]
*  to God and raise him up and then he raises you up and that's just the way I've always [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4502.12s)]
*  looked at it. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4506.24s)]
*  God gives you talents, he gives you drives to do things, and then gives you a platform [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4507.879999999999s)]
*  and you can either make it about yourself or turn around and give the glory back to [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4515.799999999999s)]
*  God and it's just that constant trade-off that's always going on. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4520.12s)]
*  Wow, I never really, yeah, that's a great way to say that, man. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4525.599999999999s)]
*  It's like volleying with tennis kind of. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4530.28s)]
*  It's like love, love, love, love, you know? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4532.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4535.88s)]
*  Huh. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4536.88s)]
*  That's fascinating, man. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4537.88s)]
*  Do you have a pretty good faith? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4538.88s)]
*  Is it just that has a pretty strong faith brand? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4540.76s)]
*  Is it a lot of your band members or is it a church going group? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4542.76s)]
*  We're definitely not a church going group, but yeah, we're all pretty faith-based. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4547.04s)]
*  Especially the five core of it, we all come from different religious backgrounds with [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4550.6s)]
*  it too. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4555.72s)]
*  Like I said, I'm Catholic, Drew's Methodist, Brandon grew up Pentecostal, John, I don't [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4556.72s)]
*  know where he came from. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4562.04s)]
*  Southern Baptist. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4563.04s)]
*  Southern Baptist. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4564.04s)]
*  Wow, yeah. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4565.04s)]
*  So we actually, I mean, we've had a lot of late- [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4566.04s)]
*  Through the portal then. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4567.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4568.04s)]
*  And it's like none of us are fighting to live like a Baptist or to live like a Catholic. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4569.04s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4575.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4576.8s)]
*  It's just we all grew up that way. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4577.8s)]
*  We have some great conversations though. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4578.8s)]
*  The goal is to do what God puts you here to do. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4580.56s)]
*  That goes back to not making it about yourself. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4582.56s)]
*  It's something bigger is going on than just yourself. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4585.360000000001s)]
*  And so I think that's another big reason why we haven't broken up or anything. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4588.88s)]
*  Even when we do disagree or getting fights or whatever, the goal doesn't change. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4594.900000000001s)]
*  There's still something bigger going on. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4600.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4602.28s)]
*  But to get everybody to believe that, that's hard to do, you know, because some people [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4603.28s)]
*  can believe something. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4607.4800000000005s)]
*  You know? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4608.4800000000005s)]
*  And two out of five people sometimes will be like, yes, this is how I believe and this [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4610.16s)]
*  is how I'm going to behave based on that belief that there is something bigger than us going [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4613.839999999999s)]
*  on. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4618.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4619.639999999999s)]
*  But to really get all five, that's pretty miraculous. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4620.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4623.36s)]
*  I think. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4624.36s)]
*  You know? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4625.36s)]
*  And it's not like, I mean, like our, even our whole road crew, we're built of, you got [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4626.36s)]
*  Christians, we got atheists. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4630.08s)]
*  It's just like we have a common goal and it could be something different for that other [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4632.32s)]
*  guy, but we know it's something bigger than ourselves. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4636.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4639.280000000001s)]
*  And I know if somebody doesn't believe, it's not my job to save them. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4640.280000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4643.68s)]
*  I'm not going to, I'm not, I'm not out trying to preach to anybody or convert anybody or [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4644.68s)]
*  anything like that. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4649.72s)]
*  I'm simply just singing songs. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4650.72s)]
*  And if you like it, if you like the message and if you like what we do, then listen. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4652.8s)]
*  And I don't care what you believe or anything like that. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4656.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4658.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'm not the Lord's EMT. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4659.200000000001s)]
*  That's what I say. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4660.200000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4661.200000000001s)]
*  The best thing you can do is pray for them, man. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4662.200000000001s)]
*  There's power in prayer. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4664.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4665.0s)]
*  I'm not the Lord's EMT. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4666.32s)]
*  You get right behind and get through traffic. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4667.32s)]
*  I used to do that one when I was younger. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4669.32s)]
*  I tuck behind that thing. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4671.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4672.8s)]
*  I would use the Lord to skirt through traffic. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4673.8s)]
*  He's lead blocking for me right through rush hour. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4675.8s)]
*  Amen, bro. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4678.8s)]
*  Driving blind, man. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4679.8s)]
*  I used to love to try to look in that back window and see what they're doing in there. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4680.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4684.4s)]
*  They should put on the outside what's going on. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4685.4s)]
*  Oh, well, I like how they leave the lights on. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4687.64s)]
*  You can see them in there working on somebody. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4689.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4690.84s)]
*  It's almost like, it's almost like. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4691.84s)]
*  It's kind of eerie though when you see an ambulance with lights but no sirens. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4692.84s)]
*  That guy's dead in there. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4695.48s)]
*  More than likely. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4696.48s)]
*  Let's just drive him to the hospital. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4697.48s)]
*  Well, it's almost like, do they say, is it cheap or not to do the sirens? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4698.48s)]
*  I wonder at that point, it's like, oh, this guy's dead or just run up the bill. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4701.5199999999995s)]
*  This guy's dead. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4705.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4706.12s)]
*  Does that siren cost you a little extra? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4707.12s)]
*  They got insurance. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4708.12s)]
*  You go the whole thing. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4709.12s)]
*  They don't take you. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4710.12s)]
*  You ain't got no insurance. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4711.12s)]
*  You're sitting in traffic. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4712.12s)]
*  We'll get you there, buddy, but you're going to save about $500. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4713.12s)]
*  They should have a second level of ambulance for people that don't want to pay the high [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4715.84s)]
*  premiums of regular ambulances. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4721.8s)]
*  How much does it cost for an ambulance to come get you? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4724.12s)]
*  Oh, you already had it, dude. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4726.6s)]
*  With insurance, the average out of pocket cost for an ambulance ride is $450. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4727.88s)]
*  So that's like an Uber black from probably. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4731.400000000001s)]
*  Across town at least. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4734.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4735.16s)]
*  You could probably get from Lebanon to here. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4736.16s)]
*  $450 black maybe? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4738.56s)]
*  That's true. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4740.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4741.2s)]
*  That's a decent ride. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4742.2s)]
*  You might be able to get to Chattanooga in a regular Uber. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4743.2s)]
*  In a regular Uber, yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4746.12s)]
*  That's a long ride. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4747.12s)]
*  Yeah, they should have that secondary market. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4749.12s)]
*  Like, hey, I don't know, I'm hurt. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4751.28s)]
*  I don't know, you know, I'm not going to die. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4754.5599999999995s)]
*  Get me over, you know what I'm saying? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4756.92s)]
*  Like, get maybe a thing of Narcan in the door. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4758.24s)]
*  I still feel like Uber could do something for you. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4760.5599999999995s)]

*  Uber E. It's a little more expensive. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4767.2s)]
*  They'll drive like a maniac. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4768.639999999999s)]
*  You maybe get a little yellow light or something. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4769.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4771.599999999999s)]

*  Stick you with something. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4782.2s)]
*  Dude, my mom would deliver newspapers, so she would have that one arm, boy, it was just [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4783.2s)]
*  a second arm. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=4787.96s)]

*  It was enjoyable. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5307.4s)]
*  Was it a small horse? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5308.4s)]
*  God, it was so little. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5309.4s)]
*  I mean, dude, it was this big, brother. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5310.4s)]
*  You think there's inbreeding to make them that size? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5313.4s)]
*  It looked like it wouldn't go to regular school, I'll say that, when I looked in its eyes. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5316.759999999999s)]
*  But it was this big, man. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5323.759999999999s)]
*  You could tell. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5324.759999999999s)]
*  And he rode the short trailer. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5325.759999999999s)]
*  The short trailer. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5326.759999999999s)]
*  Did it still stand up on its own? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5327.759999999999s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5330.759999999999s)]
*  It tried to. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5331.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5332.759999999999s)]
*  We out here making fun of that horse. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5333.759999999999s)]
*  I thought it was a pig that they goosed in the air on. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5334.759999999999s)]
*  That horse got issues, man. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5337.759999999999s)]
*  We're bullying that poor horse. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5340.759999999999s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5343.759999999999s)]
*  Look, man. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5344.759999999999s)]
*  I think the boat is probably opening up for a no-humped camel. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5346.12s)]
*  That horse is doing fine. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5350.64s)]
*  Paying money to see that horse. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5351.64s)]
*  You got the Budweiser horses. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5352.64s)]
*  I paid, I think, probably $2, $2.80 to see it. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5353.64s)]
*  Horses can do it. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5356.400000000001s)]
*  Why can't people do it? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5357.400000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5358.400000000001s)]
*  That's a great point, huh? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5359.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5360.400000000001s)]
*  Let people take the show on the road, man. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5361.400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5363.16s)]
*  We're getting to a point where it's like little things are going to start to start up and [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5364.16s)]
*  a man's going to be, you know, his own little homeless salt bay or whatever and making meats [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5368.08s)]
*  out of his cart. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5374.32s)]
*  And you're going to have, yeah, everything should, everything's going to have to be financed. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5375.32s)]
*  People are having a tough time. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5379.5199999999995s)]
*  Everything becomes for sale. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5381.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5383.48s)]
*  I mean, everybody's like moving into tiny homes and they're going to start starting [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5384.48s)]
*  these little villages, have a little doctor and a dentist and a makeshift trading station. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5388.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5395.12s)]
*  And we have an end of the world plan and sometimes I just wish it happened. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5396.12s)]
*  Sounds fun. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5399.0s)]
*  You guys have a plan? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5400.0s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5401.0s)]
*  I can't talk about it because I'll tell you where we're at. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5402.0s)]
*  But we all got little jobs already set up. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5403.0s)]
*  We got land picked out. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5406.0s)]
*  Sometimes I just think that'd be kind of fun. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5408.12s)]
*  Well, you'd be a bet. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5410.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5411.12s)]
*  At least you would have a skill to you'd have a band skill. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5412.12s)]
*  Oh, we're going to be hunting and gathering. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5415.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5417.24s)]
*  They ain't going to be more, no more time for music. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5418.24s)]
*  When he's got Native American in him. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5419.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5421.84s)]
*  We grow the crops. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5422.84s)]
*  We're tracking the buffalo, man. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5423.84s)]
*  We ain't got buffalo in Alabama. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5424.84s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5425.84s)]
*  We're tracking the buffalo. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5426.84s)]
*  We got something down there. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5427.84s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5428.84s)]
*  I've been outside of Alabama, Buffalo. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5430.68s)]
*  What, do you guys go on tour with the new band now or it's just your tour now? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5434.12s)]
*  Is there a point where you don't open for other bands? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5441.64s)]
*  How does that kind of work? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5444.88s)]
*  It's just our shows now and they keep selling out. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5445.88s)]
*  So we keep having to move to bigger venues because people are getting pissed about it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5448.360000000001s)]
*  But we are actually opening up for the Rolling Stones on May the 30th. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5453.16s)]
*  So that's going to be cool. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5457.32s)]
*  That one's pretty exciting. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5458.32s)]
*  Where's that at? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5459.84s)]
*  It's on Gillette Stadium, Foxboro. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5460.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5462.88s)]
*  That's going to be pretty, that one actually just hit us last week. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5463.88s)]
*  So things like that are kind of popping up all the time now? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5469.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool because Mick Jagger allegedly has to approve all of the openers. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5472.28s)]
*  So he approved us. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5477.2s)]
*  I think we get to take a picture with them too. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5478.88s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5480.599999999999s)]
*  What the rules are. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5481.599999999999s)]
*  We're kind of at a point now where we're, I hate to say too big, but there's a point [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5482.599999999999s)]
*  where you can't open for people and there's, now we're in this weird state of trying to [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5486.92s)]
*  get people to open for us. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5492.12s)]
*  There's a, you got to, it's like a juggling act of figuring that out. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5494.2s)]
*  What bands are big, that can open for you and what bands are we able to open up for? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5498.96s)]
*  Which really be like the Foo Fighters and Chris Stapleton or something at this point. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5503.4800000000005s)]
*  So we only got to really do it a couple of times with, especially with Elle. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5508.64s)]
*  We did a whole tour with her, like 40 days. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5512.56s)]
*  She's the only one. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5515.12s)]
*  She was the first one that took us out like that. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5516.16s)]
*  The only one. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5518.44s)]
*  We've never done it with anybody else. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5519.44s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5522.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5523.04s)]
*  Her, I saw her perform during COVID here in Nashville. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5524.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5528.24s)]
*  I haven't been to one of her shows though. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5529.24s)]
*  I got to go check her out. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5530.24s)]
*  Yeah, she's cool. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5531.24s)]
*  She's good. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5532.24s)]
*  It's on a good show. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5533.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5534.24s)]
*  People love her. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5535.24s)]
*  Was there a moment where you guys kind of felt like, dang, we really got a real shot [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5537.639999999999s)]
*  or we're kind of making it? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5541.92s)]
*  Like what does this look like? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5544.92s)]
*  Was there like one moment where you guys all just maybe walked into a place and sat down [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5546.12s)]
*  and then you like looked at each other and you're like, damn, are we like making it? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5552.0s)]
*  Are we doing it? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5557.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5558.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5559.12s)]
*  Because it's a weird thing, but it's a real thing that happens. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5560.12s)]
*  I think we have little moments like that. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5561.12s)]
*  Like when we first got on the tour bus and got off the bus, getting driven around in [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5562.64s)]
*  a pre-vost, selling out the, we sold out three days at the Ryman in like four hours. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5568.4400000000005s)]
*  And that was really cool too. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5573.42s)]
*  And those were in September. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5575.66s)]
*  Is that the ones coming up in September? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5576.66s)]
*  That was a moment like, because we had, we knew, we had a good feeling we'd sell one. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5578.02s)]
*  And then it was like, okay, the second one, we got to throw it up right now, like within [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5583.22s)]
*  the hour. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5586.82s)]
*  And then it's like, we got a third one. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5587.82s)]
*  We probably could have done five nights. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5588.9s)]
*  The manager was like, hey, pick an opener right now for a third night. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5590.38s)]
*  We're doing it. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5593.1s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5594.1s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5595.1s)]
*  We got to throw it up in 30 minutes. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5596.1s)]
*  I'd say that's a moment. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5598.54s)]
*  And we got some big shows coming up this fall that are going to be kind of one of those [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5599.58s)]

*  Can we get them? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5624.7s)]
*  We have friends too, like Taylor Honeycutt. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5626.06s)]
*  She's from Montgomery and she's got started about the same time we did and she's on the [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5630.34s)]

*  It's going to give me a lot of good stuff to listen to. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5642.860000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5652.06s)]
*  I've heard about this before. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5653.06s)]
*  It's a syndrome. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5654.26s)]
*  Sounds like alcoholism. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5655.26s)]
*  But it's where your body makes booze. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5660.780000000001s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5662.58s)]
*  A Belgian man has been acquitted of drunk driving because he has auto brewery syndrome, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5663.58s)]
*  a rare condition whereby the body produces alcohol, his lawyer said. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5668.7s)]
*  People are not born with ABS but can develop it when they already have another intestine [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5674.38s)]
*  related condition. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5679.3s)]
*  Symptoms can present with symptoms consistent with alcohol intoxication such as slurred [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5680.82s)]
*  speech, stumbling, loss of motor power. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5684.62s)]
*  So he's like always buzzed. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5686.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's not similar. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5687.62s)]
*  He's just always drunk. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5688.98s)]
*  That's got to be crazy though if you just. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5690.179999999999s)]
*  To not have to drink anything but you're always buzzed. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5692.46s)]
*  Yeah, people are like damn. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5694.42s)]
*  How does that happen? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5695.42s)]
*  Does he have to put like fruit juice in and get some hooch out? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5696.42s)]
*  I don't know, like Randy's burping y'all. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5699.66s)]
*  It's going to be a pull over. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5701.66s)]
*  Don't let him drink that apple juice. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5702.66s)]
*  Pull over, baby. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5705.66s)]
*  He's peeing liquor at that point. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5708.0599999999995s)]
*  Don't let him drive, man. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5710.42s)]
*  I have a hard time believing. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5711.42s)]
*  That sounds like some European stuff. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5714.42s)]
*  Auto brewery syndrome or gut fermentation syndrome is a condition in which ethanol is [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5717.18s)]
*  produced through the endogenous fermentation by fungi or bacteria in the gastrointestinal [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5721.46s)]
*  system, oral cavity or urinary system. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5727.5s)]
*  Dang, you can make your own. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5730.1s)]
*  That body wine, baby. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5732.860000000001s)]
*  So does that come with the problem of drinking too much alcohol too? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5734.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5740.42s)]
*  Are you literally an alcoholic? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5741.42s)]
*  I guess just by standing around. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5744.22s)]
*  What happens if he gives blood? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5746.46s)]
*  Shoot, I don't know. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5747.46s)]
*  I'll take a pint though. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5748.46s)]
*  I'll take two pints, dude. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5749.46s)]
*  Hook that man up. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5750.46s)]
*  What else? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5755.46s)]
*  Any other news we got? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5756.46s)]
*  I did see they had, what was that? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5757.46s)]

*  Did you get your degree? [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5908.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I got it. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5909.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5910.0599999999995s)]
*  It's hanging up. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5911.0599999999995s)]
*  I was kind of blessed in the sense of my parents weren't very hands-on as far as that [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5912.0599999999995s)]
*  goes. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5916.42s)]
*  They were like, well, trust God and do what you're going to do, man. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5917.42s)]
*  Just pray and have a relationship with God and go find your calling. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5919.9800000000005s)]
*  I didn't really have people holding my hand too much or overbearing parents or anything [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5925.62s)]
*  like that. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5930.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5931.54s)]
*  I could see it being tough though as a parent and that's what your kids getting into. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5932.54s)]
*  Because especially our parents, they grew up in the 70s, 80s. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5935.14s)]
*  Back then it was a lot different. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5939.62s)]
*  Yeah, dude, shooting heroin. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5940.62s)]
*  My dad was working for me. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5941.62s)]
*  My dad works in construction. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5942.62s)]
*  So I was like, yeah, son, if you want to be a rock star, go do it. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5943.82s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5947.66s)]
*  Yeah, it probably is. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5948.66s)]
*  I guess that's the two different types of parents is either you got to go with something [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5949.66s)]
*  safe or are you going to be like, dude, I've had to do something safer. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5954.42s)]
*  Won't you get out there and take a swing at it both? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5959.099999999999s)]
*  What people need to realize is whatever you want to do, you have to make that your safe. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5961.62s)]
*  Make that your safety net. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5966.5s)]
*  You can only go so long with a backup plan or a side job. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5968.7s)]
*  Yeah, eventually you're going to just have to dive into it and make that your safety [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5972.62s)]
*  net. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5976.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5977.18s)]
*  Figure it out. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5978.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point, man. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5979.18s)]
*  Even with comedy, you hear a lot of comics started out sleeping in the back of their [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5980.18s)]
*  cars. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5984.5s)]
*  I mean, same with musicians sleeping out in their cars to go do another show the next [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5985.5s)]
*  day and you just got to send it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5988.38s)]
*  Yeah, I remember I was in love one time with a girl and I was like, I tried to stop and [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5991.0199999999995s)]
*  do real estate for a while and I couldn't do real estate real good. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=5995.86s)]
*  I actually filled out one of the leases wrong or something and bought the house yourself. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6002.46s)]
*  No, I had to pay some lady's rent though. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6008.02s)]
*  Really? [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6010.26s)]
*  Yeah, I messed up. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6011.26s)]
*  During COVID, I sold roofs. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6014.9800000000005s)]
*  You sold roofs? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6016.94s)]
*  Yeah, during 2020 when those two or three hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast at once. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6018.5s)]
*  Everybody was down there just selling roofs and I was working with one of the companies [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6023.58s)]
*  by one of my friends because he knew COVID had happened and shows weren't very common [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6028.26s)]
*  at the time. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6033.9400000000005s)]
*  So he hooked me up with a job working with him. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6034.9400000000005s)]
*  I think I sold three or four roofs and every single roof that I sold, he lost money on. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6037.74s)]
*  He'd get under there and just find more and more stuff wrong with it. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6042.34s)]
*  It ended up being a $40,000 job and the insurance only covered like 20,000 of it. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6045.84s)]
*  You're like Brandon. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6050.7s)]
*  I'm not a good roof seller, man. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6052.26s)]
*  I'm not a good salesman, period. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6053.74s)]
*  Your job is to convince you to buy something and my attitude was just like, buy it or not, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6056.98s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6060.94s)]
*  If you don't want it, no skin off my back. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6061.94s)]
*  It's like the opposite of what you're supposed to do. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6064.38s)]
*  Hurricane jobs are a real thing where we are. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6067.42s)]
*  It's really true. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6069.42s)]
*  You hope for them hurricanes. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6070.42s)]
*  Well, it's so funny. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6071.42s)]
*  So many of my friends work in where they sell the help process, people's insurance claims [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6075.22s)]
*  and all of that. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6080.62s)]
*  That's what I got during COVID. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6081.62s)]
*  My fiance's dad is an insurance adjuster. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6083.22s)]
*  So I was like untrained, I was climbing on people's roofs, marking stuff with them. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6087.34s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6091.54s)]
*  I was up there just circling stuff. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6092.54s)]
*  Just drawing whatever? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6095.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6096.38s)]
*  I'd sign my name on half of them, just go up there and circle damage and take a picture [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6097.38s)]
*  of it. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6102.54s)]
*  Well, what's scary is- [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6103.54s)]
*  I would hate to be those homeowners. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6104.54s)]
*  You got this hippie coming and climbing on your roof, up there coloring and drawing. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6105.54s)]
*  Yeah, he's just writing widespread panic lyrics up there. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6109.7s)]
*  Yeah, you need a new roof. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6113.820000000001s)]
*  Draw the Wayland symbol. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6114.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6115.820000000001s)]
*  Have you guys gotten to meet widespread? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6116.820000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6118.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, we listen, I wouldn't say we're the biggest fans, but I mean, I think everybody's [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6119.820000000001s)]
*  listened to them at this point. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6124.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6125.740000000001s)]
*  It's just something, you don't hear a lot of people get to meet. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6126.740000000001s)]
*  It's just, they're kind of like one of those interesting groups, you know. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6128.580000000001s)]
*  That's like Eric, we played with Eric Church, didn't meet him. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6131.540000000001s)]
*  He sent a bottle of whiskey with a note, but we didn't meet the guy. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6134.34s)]
*  I think it's because he would literally fly in and play the show and fly out. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6137.740000000001s)]
*  I think that's how a lot of those really, really big guys are. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6140.46s)]
*  They come in, get business done and they're out. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6143.18s)]
*  I went to Eric's house a couple years ago. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6145.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, you hung out with him. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6148.74s)]
*  Yeah, and wrote a song, me and Matthew and Drew wrote a song with him. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6149.74s)]
*  How do you something like that get set up? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6152.78s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6154.46s)]
*  I think one of them, booking agents reached out to him? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6156.1s)]
*  Probably. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6161.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think it got set up through the managers and I don't really know. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6162.66s)]
*  I can't remember how that went about. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6166.16s)]
*  If he reached out to us or if we reached out to him. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6168.599999999999s)]
*  Are there writing sessions that you have scheduled coming up kind of thing? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6171.2s)]
*  Or is that just like once in a while sort of thing? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6176.96s)]
*  How does like, because you guys have a new album, so you won't be writing for a while [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6179.16s)]
*  or you just kind of write as you go? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6182.599999999999s)]
*  Me, Drew and Matthew make a yearly trip up here in January after the new year and that's, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6184.32s)]
*  we usually stay up here for a week and do a bunch of writing. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6190.5s)]
*  No, we're trying to do that more often now. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6193.68s)]
*  But yeah, well, sometimes we'll meet people too and just get a co-write scheduled. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6197.92s)]
*  A lot of times though, when we write our stuff of our own, it happens when we're at home. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6203.320000000001s)]
*  It's very hard to write and make music when you're touring all the time. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6210.240000000001s)]
*  Most of our songs come from with Brandon, Drew and Matthew writing and rather than from [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6213.56s)]
*  a co-write somewhere. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6218.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6220.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6221.2s)]
*  It's just kind of how it happens. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6222.2s)]
*  That's how it happens, man. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6224.599999999999s)]
*  We play all the new records at the live shows pretty much. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6226.04s)]
*  Oh, sweet, sweet. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6228.72s)]
*  That's how we test them out. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6229.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6230.88s)]
*  And so the feedback, the response has been good. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6231.88s)]
*  Well, that's how we even do it before we even go in the studio. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6233.08s)]
*  We just start playing stuff at the crowd. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6235.78s)]
*  If we don't feel a good response and we kind of go back and change a couple things and [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6237.28s)]
*  they kind of grow with us on the road and we get, I mean, it's like, it's quick feedback. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6242.88s)]
*  You're constantly in a space where you can experiment. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6248.24s)]
*  We can test. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6250.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6251.2s)]
*  That's pretty awesome, huh? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6252.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6253.2s)]
*  It's like going out and trying jokes on the crowd to see if it laughs or not. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6254.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6256.72s)]
*  No, that is one nice thing about having shows where you're just kind of cruising along and [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6257.72s)]
*  you're working and you're writing at the same time because I learned a lot of times in the [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6260.72s)]
*  moment up on stage. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6263.84s)]
*  You can write it, but after a while you kind of know your voice too and you know what will [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6266.84s)]
*  kind of roll for you. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6271.04s)]
*  I think that's what you can't get. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6272.24s)]
*  And I'm not knocking anybody who does like The Voice or American Idol because if that's [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6275.84s)]
*  your way, if that's the path you want to take, then cool. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6279.32s)]
*  But you can't skip the road dogging it. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6283.32s)]
*  You can't skip playing in front of a crowd or playing in front of empty rooms. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6286.759999999999s)]
*  No matter if you win a TV show or not, you're still going to have to acquire that experience [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6291.2s)]
*  or it's just, you're going to have a hard time navigating, trying to figure out how [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6296.599999999999s)]
*  to work a crowd or figure out what works and what doesn't work. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6300.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6303.44s)]
*  I would hate to have gotten to had a chance to have a larger crowd and not known. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6304.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6310.0s)]
*  I mean, even then it's still tough sometimes because it's still, you're in front of a huge [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6311.0s)]
*  group of people. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6315.04s)]
*  I mean, you see all the time, like entertainers have problems with people throwing them out. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6316.04s)]
*  We've had to throw people out of shows or people throwing stuff at like, Nicki Minaj [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6321.28s)]
*  gets something thrown at her every other week, it looks like. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6326.96s)]
*  But I don't understand that. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6329.96s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6331.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's like, there's always going to be that element that you're in a live space, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6332.44s)]
*  but to not have had the reps of like, I know how to be here. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6335.96s)]
*  It gives you some confidence too. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6340.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6341.719999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I couldn't imagine, especially a comedian, like you're saying, that just gets [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6342.719999999999s)]
*  thrown out to the wolves. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6346.28s)]
*  You're here, so over an arena, good luck. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6347.28s)]
*  But a lot of those guys off of Keltonial have to do that. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6348.719999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6351.08s)]
*  They go from a minute to, I don't know what you get as an opener. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6352.08s)]
*  Well, they just go- [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6354.679999999999s)]
*  You get a couple more? [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6355.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a goal. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6356.679999999999s)]
*  I remember when you got to, they usually start you with three minutes. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6358.48s)]
*  As a first opener? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6362.12s)]
*  Yeah, comedian with three minutes. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6363.32s)]
*  When you're first starting out, they're like, okay, you're on a show, it's like you're going [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6364.64s)]
*  to do three minutes. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6367.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6368.96s)]
*  And you're like, okay, can I get through three minutes? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6369.96s)]
*  And if you have to get down early, you're just like, I'm done. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6371.32s)]
*  And they're like, well, you weren't, but okay, come on back here. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6374.64s)]
*  And then you try to get up to five. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6380.4s)]
*  And when you really start feeling like you're rocking as a comedian, and then you get to [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6382.24s)]
*  like- [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6385.04s)]
*  That 15 mark? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6386.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6387.04s)]
*  I could see that. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6388.04s)]
*  You got a little time to get uncomfortable. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6389.04s)]
*  You're like, I might go on the road. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6390.04s)]
*  You might start saying shit like that to people. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6391.28s)]
*  And people are like, you're out of your mind. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6393.32s)]
*  You work at Dairy Queen. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6395.759999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6396.759999999999s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6397.759999999999s)]
*  I got a 15 minute set, man. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6398.759999999999s)]
*  You don't know me. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6399.759999999999s)]
*  I'm going on tour. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6400.759999999999s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6401.759999999999s)]
*  And you just start yelling at people while you're trying to throw that trash into the [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6402.759999999999s)]
*  bin at night behind the Dairy Queen. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6408.599999999999s)]
*  Testing it out on the homeless people who are still hanging around outside. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6410.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6414.2s)]
*  And then that's when it gets like, that's when you can kind of go on the road with somebody. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6415.2s)]
*  But then there's those moments where you get stranded. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6419.48s)]
*  You burned all your 15 in 10 minutes. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6421.12s)]
*  It was a bad show and you still have to kill five minutes. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6422.919999999999s)]
*  We've had shows where you just want it to be over. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6426.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6428.879999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6429.879999999999s)]
*  Sometimes it's just the energy of a room. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6430.879999999999s)]
*  It's just the night just is what it is. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6431.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, we had one recent. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6433.719999999999s)]
*  Sometimes it's just from being tired. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6435.4s)]
*  Like we're just trying to think now we're no more than four shows a week and no more [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6438.0s)]
*  than three in a row. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6442.08s)]
*  Because by that third show, and we've had five shows in a row. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6443.959999999999s)]
*  And it's like by that third show, you usually, you need a break. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6447.92s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you're taken away from the crowd anyway, because if you're up [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6452.08s)]
*  there tired and too tired to give it your all, then you're selling your crowd short. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6455.28s)]
*  Yeah, you just kind of go into the motions. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6460.84s)]
*  But I mean, we've done that and people at the shows like, that's the best show I've [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6462.36s)]
*  ever seen. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6465.84s)]
*  Sometimes it's like Tortuga though, where it's like everybody's vibing to a completely [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6466.84s)]
*  different style of music than we play. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6472.72s)]
*  And then we show up just playing rock and roll and the crowd's just like, bring back [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6474.72s)]
*  the beat. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6478.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, they were like doing, it's like a bro country or pop country. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6479.52s)]
*  And then we're in the middle of it. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6484.8s)]
*  We don't even consider ourselves country. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6486.0s)]
*  It's just like we ruined everybody's beach party. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6487.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they're out there. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6489.320000000001s)]
*  They want songs about getting drunk. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6490.46s)]
*  Oh, I could see that kind of you guys are kind of in a little bit, not your own space, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6491.92s)]
*  but what is it? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6496.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6497.16s)]
*  We just do what we want, I guess. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6498.16s)]
*  We call it non-dom rock. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6499.5s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6500.8s)]
*  Non-denominational rock and roll. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6502.68s)]
*  It's just like all over the place. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6504.280000000001s)]
*  Everybody's at that beach and we're like, here's one about mental health. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6507.08s)]
*  Enjoy. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6509.96s)]
*  If you know somebody. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6510.96s)]
*  Strays though, that's kind of strays. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6512.96s)]
*  That's what strays do, man. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6513.96s)]
*  Yeah, that part came from just kind of being, I wouldn't say outcast, but we were always [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6515.96s)]
*  a little different from the crowds we grew up in. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6520.320000000001s)]
*  Didn't quite fit in. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6522.92s)]
*  I went to private school. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6523.92s)]
*  I didn't fit in with a lot of those kids. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6524.92s)]
*  I didn't really put that together too. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6526.92s)]
*  Yeah, we are kind of straying from the norm. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6528.280000000001s)]
*  From the norm musically. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6531.48s)]
*  A lot of people don't really know where to put us. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6533.639999999999s)]
*  Well there's some riffs in there. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6536.2s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like some of it has an Aerosmith kind of, it's interesting. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6537.2s)]
*  I'll go through different moments where I feel different things. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6540.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, I mean, when we're writing or making music, we don't try to sound like [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6543.0s)]
*  anybody or we just do what we think sounds cool. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6547.639999999999s)]
*  I think that's really cool to find your own little niche. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6552.0s)]
*  Yeah, well look, I think it's just a testament to, but to be able to figure out what works [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6554.36s)]
*  for five guys at once is pretty remarkable. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6559.68s)]
*  You know, because you really have five inputs, even though you have only three or four guys [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6562.280000000001s)]
*  contribute maybe on the songwriting edge. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6566.84s)]
*  We still all work it up together. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6569.72s)]
*  We all create the songs together. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6571.280000000001s)]
*  But then, yeah, it just goes back to not being able to skip that step, playing in front of [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6573.64s)]
*  crowds together as a band and road dogging it and everything that comes along with all [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6577.92s)]
*  of that. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6584.52s)]
*  That's where you start to figure out how each other plays or what each other is about to [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6586.200000000001s)]
*  do. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6590.52s)]
*  It's kind of like, what is it, telekinesis? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6591.52s)]
*  Telekinesis, tele... [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6595.04s)]
*  Telekinetic? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6596.52s)]
*  No, it's not telekinetic. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6597.52s)]
*  What's the word we're looking for? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6599.120000000001s)]
*  Telepathic. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6600.120000000001s)]
*  When women all get on the same menstrual cycle or whatever, like on a volleyball team. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6601.120000000001s)]
*  We definitely have that. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6604.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6605.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, we're on the same musical cycle. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6606.4800000000005s)]
*  I like that, man. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6607.76s)]
*  Any unique things that have happened out on the road? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6611.240000000001s)]
*  Any wildcat, any... [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6613.160000000001s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6614.160000000001s)]
*  We got stories for days. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6615.28s)]
*  Anything that really shook you out there? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6617.24s)]
*  Man, we... [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6618.72s)]
*  We had recent? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6619.72s)]
*  Or just in general? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6620.72s)]
*  Back in the day, we've had bus fires. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6621.72s)]
*  We've blown... [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6624.08s)]
*  We did a whole transmission swap ourselves in Colorado. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6625.2s)]
*  No way. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6627.599999999999s)]
*  We bought another bus. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6628.599999999999s)]
*  We were going through Colorado, I think. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6630.8s)]
*  I-70 had washed out. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6634.16s)]
*  Yeah, I-70 was washed out. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6635.44s)]
*  So we had to go the Fair Play up through where South Park is, and it's like 13,000 feet. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6637.0s)]
*  And we had to go the back way to get to Grand Junction. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6642.12s)]
*  We were going up the side of this mountain and I was laying in my bunk. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6645.96s)]
*  I was driving. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6648.76s)]
*  I hear Andrew screaming. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6649.76s)]
*  I had my headphones in and I hear him screaming, like, we just blew the transmission out. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6651.36s)]
*  And we're literally on the side of a mountain. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6655.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's 90 degrees straight down, 90 degrees straight up, two lane road. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6657.72s)]
*  Just right there. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6662.04s)]
*  Like right against the side of it with rocks, and there's a falling rock sign. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6663.04s)]
*  And then Drew steps out of the bus and hits some gravel and immediately falls down. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6667.56s)]
*  Just pissed. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6671.4400000000005s)]
*  He gets up and starts punching the bus. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6672.4400000000005s)]
*  I just knew it was happening. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6675.68s)]
*  We're just going. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6676.92s)]
*  When you get up that high, with our diesel especially, you lose, you know the math, you [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6678.240000000001s)]
*  lose what, 3% for every thousand feet or so. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6683.4800000000005s)]
*  Of what, brain power or whatever? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6686.080000000001s)]
*  Our brain power. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6688.280000000001s)]
*  No, for the motor. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6689.280000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6690.280000000001s)]
*  Like, if the air is so thin, the motor has to work harder. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6691.280000000001s)]
*  Probably some brain power too. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6693.68s)]
*  Yeah, we're definitely losing some brain power. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6694.68s)]
*  I'm not good with altitude. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6697.16s)]
*  I've had some bad times. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6698.72s)]
*  And how'd you get that thing back down? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6700.88s)]
*  You had a tow truck? [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6702.04s)]
*  Yeah, we had to order. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6703.04s)]
*  We had to get a semi truck. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6704.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6705.04s)]
*  Loaded the bus up and our trailer. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6706.04s)]
*  Like a $5,000 tow to the Buena Vista. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6707.04s)]
*  A state trooper gave us a ride as well out of the goodness of his heart. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6710.5199999999995s)]
*  And yeah, Buena Vista, Colorado. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6714.56s)]
*  And there was like one hotel room left in that whole town. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6718.68s)]
*  Because I was calling and calling and calling while we were waiting on the tow truck. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6721.32s)]
*  And finally got it and we all piled up in that one hotel room. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6725.04s)]
*  I'm like, well, what are we going to do? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6728.16s)]
*  Me and Andrew, so we had the bus dropped off at a transmission shop in town. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6730.64s)]
*  And it was probably a good four miles away. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6735.04s)]
*  And we got up the next morning right before the sun come up and just start walking towards [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6738.24s)]
*  it. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6743.04s)]
*  And we're like 10,000 feet. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6744.2s)]
*  I mean, we're sea level men. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6746.36s)]
*  We ain't built for that. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6748.56s)]
*  We finally make it to the transmission shop and he's like, man, I'm two months backed [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6749.76s)]
*  up. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6753.16s)]
*  I can't work on this. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6754.28s)]
*  Oh, so we're walking back to the hotel, wondering what we're going to do. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6755.28s)]
*  And we've we've been in that situation before. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6759.8s)]
*  And because I mean, we've had to roll up the shops like, hey, we leave it. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6761.68s)]
*  You gonna fix it or we stay in here with you. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6765.8s)]
*  And it's not like we just like we just have to throw money at people, like just work on [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6768.12s)]
*  it. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6771.48s)]
*  We'll pay you whatever. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6772.48s)]
*  And he's not having it. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6773.48s)]
*  He's like, sorry. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6774.48s)]
*  Isn't that where the shining is where the hotel is? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6775.48s)]
*  Buena Vista? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6778.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6779.08s)]
*  This is not a very nice. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6780.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's beautiful, but it's not a big town like where that big hotel would be. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6782.12s)]
*  OK, then I had to pull that one up. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6785.68s)]
*  I'm not sure that's that. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6787.2s)]
*  Yes, you were that. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6788.2s)]
*  It is up in the mountains somewhere, though. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6789.88s)]
*  Is that Montana? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6792.2s)]
*  It's in Oregon, man. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6794.04s)]
*  Do that places in England? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6796.04s)]
*  Another interiors are filmed. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6798.04s)]
*  No, the shining. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6800.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6801.88s)]
*  The interior, the real overlook hotel, maybe. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6802.88s)]
*  You know, we got a good godly woman in the sequel to the show for like two seconds. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6805.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6809.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6810.84s)]
*  Dr. Sleep. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6812.64s)]
*  But to continue what we're talking about was we started having to we started walking back [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6813.64s)]
*  just like, what do we do? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6818.400000000001s)]
*  And we had to start me and Brandon's hitchhiking to this town in Colorado, literally walking [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6819.400000000001s)]
*  out with a thumb out. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6824.76s)]
*  Yeah, with a thumb out. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6825.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6826.76s)]
*  This old guy in the Jeep picks us up and he gave us a ride to the hotel. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6827.76s)]
*  We were just like, we have to do something. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6830.24s)]
*  We've been picked up by strangers a bunch of times. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6832.64s)]
*  He dropped us off and he's like, hey, there's a white water rafting company that sells buses [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6834.76s)]
*  like the one you're talking about. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6838.68s)]
*  Maybe hit them up, see if you can buy a bus from them. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6840.64s)]
*  And we were like, yeah, whatever. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6842.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6844.200000000001s)]
*  Still tried to find someone to rebuild the transmission and the closest person that would [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6845.200000000001s)]
*  was in Denver. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6849.68s)]
*  It's like three hours away. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6850.68s)]
*  He said, if you pull it and bring it to me, I'll build it for you. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6852.280000000001s)]
*  And so before we resorted to that, we had rented a U-Haul van and went and talked to [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6855.56s)]
*  that company, the white water rafting company. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6860.72s)]
*  And he had a bus just like ours that had a freshly rebuilt transmission in it. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6863.4800000000005s)]
*  He put like 30 miles on it and parked it because he bought a school bus. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6869.36s)]
*  They used the buses to bus people out to the river to white water ramp. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6872.639999999999s)]
*  And he said he'd sell us the bus for three grand. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6877.96s)]
*  And then he figured out we were a band and he was like, well, if y'all play a show for [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6882.96s)]
*  us, I'll unlock a grand off the price. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6885.28s)]
*  No way. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6886.88s)]
*  And we were here for like four days and the place is so they do that white water rafting. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6887.88s)]
*  All these teenagers come to be the guides, like a bunch of river rats come in and they, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6892.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, those campers on the back of a pickup truck? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6897.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6899.68s)]
*  It's a field full of them. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6900.68s)]
*  Just laying on the ground. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6902.160000000001s)]
*  That's where these kids are living. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6903.320000000001s)]
*  In those? [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6905.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6906.320000000001s)]
*  And the grass is all grown up around them and they don't have power. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6907.320000000001s)]
*  So it's just the ground and then the camper top? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6908.92s)]
*  And the camper top. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6911.6s)]
*  And it's like a trailer park of them. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6912.6s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6914.200000000001s)]
*  But it's not a full trailer. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6915.200000000001s)]
*  It's just the little cabin. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6916.200000000001s)]
*  It's just that little cabin. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6917.200000000001s)]
*  It's just a camper beat, isn't it? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6918.200000000001s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6919.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6920.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, well, I think you can stand up in them, but they have like that little, the [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6921.200000000001s)]
*  part in the top you can sleep in. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6924.200000000001s)]
*  Here's what I'm picking up. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6925.5199999999995s)]
*  Pitcher on like a pickup truck and then that thing that goes on the back. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6926.5199999999995s)]
*  That goes on the bed. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6929.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6930.679999999999s)]
*  Like sits down. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6931.679999999999s)]
*  It goes on the bed and kind of goes over the cab. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6932.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, not that. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6933.679999999999s)]
*  I'm just thinking of the one that just goes, that's evil. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6935.36s)]
*  Oh, you're thinking of a camper shell. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6937.679999999999s)]
*  No, this is like a, it's like a motor home. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6939.48s)]
*  Well, now we know what you're talking about. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6941.919999999999s)]
*  With the piece that goes over the top. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6943.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6944.96s)]
*  And they're all windows. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6945.96s)]
*  Put like a window unit in them sometimes. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6946.96s)]
*  And these are straight hippies. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6947.96s)]
*  And there's no trucks, just those. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6949.16s)]
*  Just those. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6950.639999999999s)]
*  And the grass is all grown over top of them. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6951.639999999999s)]
*  They're living in them. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6952.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6953.759999999999s)]
*  It's like those, not as nice. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6955.08s)]
*  Like that one on the top right. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6956.56s)]
*  Yeah, a hundred percent. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6957.56s)]
*  No, oh, left. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6958.56s)]
*  That one's too big. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6959.56s)]
*  That one. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6960.56s)]
*  It's a bunch of those. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6961.56s)]
*  And these kids are straight up real life hippies. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6962.92s)]
*  Like straight up. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6966.04s)]
*  We were playing, we set up and played for them and they were dancing in between songs [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6967.320000000001s)]
*  kind of thing. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6970.8s)]
*  It's all gravel, it's all dusty in here in the rafting building. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6971.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6974.68s)]
*  It was probably 30 or 40 of these kids. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6975.68s)]
*  Can I say kids? [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6977.360000000001s)]
*  They're probably in their late teens, early twenties. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6978.8s)]
*  It was in the big building where they keep all the boats. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6981.64s)]
*  And we sat up in there and it was like a gravel floor and just the dust from them like scooping [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6983.52s)]
*  and shuffling. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6988.68s)]
*  Shuffle and doing that hippie shuffle. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6989.68s)]
*  Dude, that's incredible. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6990.68s)]
*  And that was a, yeah, look up, see what rafting company that was. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6992.6s)]
*  That's phenomenal. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6995.72s)]
*  Yeah, Whitewater Rafting in Buena Vista. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6996.72s)]
*  Yeah, we can, I mean, there's a couple, it's in Buena Vista. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=6997.72s)]
*  Some white water, something. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7001.400000000001s)]
*  So then you guys take off in that new bus? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7003.58s)]
*  Well, no. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7005.4400000000005s)]
*  We took the tow truck to drop our bus off next to the one we just purchased and then [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7006.44s)]
*  we just start taking them apart. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7011.839999999999s)]
*  And we took the transmission out of ours, took the transmission out of the other one [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7014.0s)]
*  and swapped them around. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7018.2s)]
*  And I did something wrong in the process. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7020.4s)]
*  I didn't put the torque converter all the way in. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7021.96s)]
*  And so we bolted it up and bent a pump gear and had to pull it back out and take it to [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7024.32s)]
*  that original transmission shop. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7029.12s)]
*  And we pulled one of the, what he was talking about, like, hey, we need you to fix this. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7030.799999999999s)]
*  We ain't leaving. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7034.32s)]
*  Fix it. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7035.32s)]
*  But having a soft spot, he actually helped us out big time. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7037.2s)]
*  He took it apart and straightened out what I had accidentally bent and put it back together [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7038.84s)]
*  and then we got it back in there. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7042.42s)]
*  A two day job turned into like a five day job and it was miserable. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7045.12s)]
*  But while like Brandon and a couple of the, and this is just the five of us on the road [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7048.04s)]
*  together, they would be working on dropping the transmission or getting the other one [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7051.32s)]
*  ready. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7055.0s)]
*  Me and Zach would be just ripping every part we could get our hands on, on this bus. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7056.0s)]
*  You don't see these buses ever in like a pull apart. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7060.179999999999s)]
*  Usually somebody will take, man, it's a seven three diesel. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7063.219999999999s)]
*  Those never show up. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7065.48s)]
*  So we're getting every part. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7066.48s)]
*  You could put a hand on snatching it out. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7067.639999999999s)]
*  We took out like the turbo. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7069.94s)]
*  We took the back AC unit. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7071.92s)]
*  We took the driver's chair, the took the steering, the steering box underneath it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7073.12s)]
*  That thing would never drive ever again in its life. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7079.259999999999s)]
*  We just straight pulled apart. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7081.679999999999s)]
*  Somebody asked if they could have it and we were like, yeah, you can have it. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7083.839999999999s)]
*  He was like, we'll just drive. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7085.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he said steer it over here and I'll pull it. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7086.799999999999s)]
*  I was like, you ain't steering nothing. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7089.0s)]
*  So we straight left it. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7090.44s)]
*  You're like, we took the steer. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7091.679999999999s)]
*  We took everything. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7092.96s)]
*  That thing was, we took the bumper. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7094.68s)]
*  We swapped the bumpers, everything. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7096.56s)]
*  I took the taillights, but we got it put back, our bus put back together with all these other [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7099.08s)]
*  parts and got down to Mississippi. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7105.12s)]
*  So you guys had to miss some shows in it or you had a little break? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7106.6s)]
*  I think we missed one show. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7109.04s)]
*  Did we? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7110.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if we did. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7111.4800000000005s)]
*  We missed the, where were we hitting? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7112.4800000000005s)]
*  Mississippi. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7114.400000000001s)]
*  No, we were hitting somewhere else. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7115.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, Grand Junction. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7116.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we missed the last Colorado show, but we had four days off, so we made it. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7117.400000000001s)]
*  We just buckled up and drove. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7122.200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7124.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was a time in our lives that was, looking back, it was fun in the moment. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7125.44s)]
*  It was, I think it was that American Adventure Expeditions looks familiar. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7130.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7134.88s)]
*  We went and stopped somewhere with this good whitewater raft and it was in Tennessee, that [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7135.88s)]

*  I bet he never went and got it. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7297.639999999999s)]
*  It's probably still sitting in the same place. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7299.2s)]
*  Any stray animals you pick up out there? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7301.8s)]

*  And RIP, sorry. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7311.44s)]

*  Exactly. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7318.16s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7345.6s)]
*  It's like we could scanner this thing and die in a plane crash. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7346.6s)]
*  Hopefully not. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7350.24s)]
*  People get popular too, and they're popular for however long, and then time goes by and [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7351.24s)]
*  then nobody knows who they are anymore. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7356.48s)]
*  That could very well be us. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHks70rxI-k&t=7357.839999999999s)]
