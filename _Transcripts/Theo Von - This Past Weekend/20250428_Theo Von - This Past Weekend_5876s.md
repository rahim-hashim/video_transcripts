*  What's up, all right, good. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=140.74s)]
*  So you wake up and do jujitsu, you mean? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=141.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, I mean, yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  So I probably wake up like, I don't know, seven, 7.30, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=144.6s)]
*  whenever the kids start making noise around the house, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  it's like, all right, sleep is done. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=150.68s)]
*  And then it's like, I look at my phone [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=152.84s)]
*  and I'm just like, all these things [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=158.04s)]
*  that these people are doing, like you did what? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=160.08s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=162.08s)]
*  It's like, I have to go fucking deal with this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=163.12s)]
*  It's like, this partner, are you really? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=164.6s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=167.88s)]
*  And then it's like, I compose myself [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=169.4s)]
*  and go fight for two hours, like recenter myself. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=171.52s)]
*  Then it's like, now I can go deal with the stuff. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=176.72s)]
*  But no, it's- [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=178.6s)]
*  So that helps, it's almost like your coffee [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=179.92s)]
*  in the morning sometimes, like rolling jujitsu kind of? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=181.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, right now I'm doing more striking. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=184.52s)]
*  So that's really fun. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=187.4s)]
*  I think it's like the greatest sport. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=188.64s)]
*  I mean, it's like neurologically stimulating. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=190.44s)]
*  It's good cardio, good strength. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=193.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=196.96s)]
*  A little bit of a threat, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  So it keeps you on, it's not like just like running. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=199.84s)]
*  I used to like run around the neighborhood, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=202.0s)]
*  but running is not that thrilling. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=203.36s)]
*  Running compared to jujitsu is for, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  running is not really neat once you can do jujitsu. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  Because I think one cool thing about jujitsu [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  is just like, you can lose a match with somebody, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=217.72000000000003s)]
*  You can lose, like they can submit you, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=220.52s)]
*  but you'll learn something along the way, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of times the guy submitting you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  also wants to help you learn too. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  So it's like, you can lose and win at the same time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  I think that's what's kind of masterful about it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=234.6s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=236.56s)]
*  Do you do it? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=237.4s)]
*  I don't do it as much as I would like to, you know? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=238.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=239.72s)]
*  Striking, I do that a lot. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=240.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, I never got enough striking, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  but I would just kind of like, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=243.8s)]
*  but I would just do jujitsu on the mats, you know? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=245.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's so fun. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=247.6s)]
*  It's just like fun to do with friends. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=248.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, and some guy chokes you so hard. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=250.4s)]
*  And then you're just like, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=254.08s)]
*  God, you're like, ugh. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=255.16s)]
*  It's a good day. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=256.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's a cup of coffee. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=257.48s)]
*  If a big fella just squeezes you [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=261.08s)]
*  until you can't handle it, it's a cup of coffee. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=262.76s)]
*  Better than caffeine for me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=264.36s)]
*  I don't know, I'm just not into that stuff. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=265.68s)]
*  Is there like a vitamin or some staple [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=268.12s)]
*  that you kind of keep in your diet, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=273.04s)]
*  if it's not caffeine? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  Is there some like- [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=275.12s)]
*  I drink a very large amount of protein. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=275.96s)]
*  I would do creatine, do you count that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=277.68s)]

*  No, no, it's never been my thing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=290.48s)]
*  We saw each other at the UFC [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=295.84s)]
*  and you and your wife were there, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=298.12s)]
*  Yeah, which one was that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=302.4s)]

*  No, I mean, this was a fun moment, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=372.44s)]
*  but watching him get hit by Ilya, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=374.64s)]
*  I mean, it was like right cage shot. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=379.08s)]
*  It was like three feet from us. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=380.28000000000003s)]

*  And so that was tough. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=383.88s)]
*  But so I think after that Priscilla was like, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=388.12s)]
*  oh man, I don't know if I can go watch VULK in person again. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=391.48s)]

*  Some tough moments in round two and four, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=401.36s)]
*  but he's his heart, man. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=404.16s)]
*  Like, I mean, the way he described it after, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=406.88s)]
*  like, did you see the shot in round four [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=408.72s)]

*  trying to stay in a good place. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=420.48s)]
*  Watching an animal try to survive [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=422.44s)]
*  on one of those animal planet shows or something, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=423.68s)]

*  about social media these days, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=440.03999999999996s)]

*  just so it's like, so you don't dwell on it, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=457.88s)]
*  but since you're a billionaire, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=459.88s)]

*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=480.76s)]

*  life is busy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=486.6s)]
*  There's like a million things that I could be doing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=488.12s)]
*  at any given point in time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=490.0s)]
*  I just think it's important to like, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=491.16s)]
*  take time each week. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=493.2s)]
*  Like, you know, Wednesday night, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=494.84s)]
*  we really try to have a date night, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=496.6s)]
*  try to hang out with the kids [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=499.08s)]
*  and put them to bed every night. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=500.48s)]
*  It's like, that's just like an important part of my routine. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=501.8s)]
*  I think that's important stuff to do. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=503.8s)]
*  But no, I mean, we try to like go out somewhere, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=505.48s)]
*  but every once in a while we'll just cook or eat at home [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=509.28s)]
*  and that's all good. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=511.76s)]
*  The UFC stuff, I think is probably more for me than for her. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=513.0s)]
*  But she's a good sport about it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=515.68s)]
*  Is there something you'll do for her? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=517.6s)]
*  Or is there like a fancy date? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=519.16s)]

*  I don't know, that is a good question. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=535.4s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=537.4s)]

*  Daniel Arsham and he's this like great sculptor. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=553.84s)]
*  And I worked with him to make this sculpture of Priscilla [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=558.04s)]
*  because I thought it was cool. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=562.2s)]

*  make a sculpture of Priscilla partially because that's cool. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=571.48s)]
*  Partially because I'm like, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=574.0s)]
*  I'm not gonna make a sculpture of myself. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=574.84s)]
*  It's like that's crazy, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=576.24s)]
*  It's like, whoa, who the fuck does that? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=577.64s)]
*  But like, so it's like, she's kind of the target [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=579.52s)]
*  of my creative energy in a lot of places. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=583.12s)]
*  Like the muse in a way. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=585.28s)]

*  It's like, you know, it's, but no, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=612.56s)]
*  but she's a good sport about it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=614.76s)]

*  in your yard is kind of nice, you know? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=626.4399999999999s)]

*  It's a good vibe. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=630.5999999999999s)]
*  Did she make you make any adjustments to it [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=631.56s)]
*  or was she like, okay, I'll accept it as is? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=633.28s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't think she was that happy with it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  Cause again, I mean, like who wants a sculpture [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  of themselves in the front yard? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=643.36s)]
*  But, you know, I think she thinks it's sweet [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=645.64s)]
*  and I think she appreciates that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=649.88s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of like more destructive things [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=653.52s)]
*  I could be doing with my creative energy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=655.4s)]

*  in like two or three days. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=751.6400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, but it's not like very aspirational. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=761.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like, hey, it's like, I'm going nowhere in life [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=763.44s)]
*  and I'm about to get kicked out of school. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=766.9200000000001s)]

*  Right, it's like, yeah, I guess another way to look at it [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=774.12s)]
*  is very sail rack in a way, you know? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=776.08s)]
*  Very sail rack, yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=778.08s)]
*  So, but I mean, but everyone I knew thought [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=779.08s)]
*  that this whole thing was over. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=781.0s)]
*  I mean, my parents drove up, we lived in New York. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=782.08s)]
*  They drove up to help me pack up my dorm room [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=785.0s)]
*  cause they were like, it's over, you're coming home. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=787.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=790.24s)]
*  But it didn't. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=792.4s)]
*  Then of course I made Facebook [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=794.24s)]
*  and a few months later I dropped out anyway. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=796.0s)]
*  So jokes on them. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=797.56s)]
*  But that's how, yeah, no, that's it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=798.4s)]
*  Did you have to go to the trial at school or you didn't? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=803.4s)]
*  Oh no, I did. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=806.16s)]
*  And it was like, the questions that they asked [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=807.0s)]
*  were even worse than the questions that I get [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=809.64s)]
*  at like the congressional hearings. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  It was like, don't you know that once you put [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=814.84s)]
*  this terrible prank website online, it is there forever. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=817.84s)]
*  And it's like, no, actually that's not how it works. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=821.88s)]
*  The site's already down. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=823.96s)]
*  They're like, you're a smart ass. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=825.88s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, that's probably true. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=827.4s)]
*  That's probably true. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=830.04s)]
*  But. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=830.88s)]
*  But. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=831.72s)]
*  But half of a smart ass also is smart. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=832.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=835.48s)]
*  So that's good. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll take that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=837.16s)]
*  It's better than being a dumb ass. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=838.0s)]
*  It's like maybe smart and a little bit of an ass. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=838.84s)]
*  And it works. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=840.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'd rather be a smart ass I think. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=842.6s)]
*  Do you know about, what was a prank site? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=844.68s)]
*  What was it? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=847.04s)]
*  That wasn't Facebook though. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=847.88s)]
*  No, no, it was this thing called Face Smash. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=848.72s)]
*  Which, in the whole lore of the thing, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=851.64s)]
*  there's this whole movie that got made [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=853.92s)]
*  about all this stuff. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  It seemed like Face Smash was a predecessor to Facebook. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=855.92s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=857.9599999999999s)]
*  When I was in college, I just liked making things. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=858.8s)]
*  So whether it's statues or minivans or internet or glasses, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=861.04s)]
*  like whatever, I just liked making stuff. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=865.56s)]
*  You liked being creative. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=867.4s)]
*  Yeah, so it was very mean spirited. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=868.24s)]
*  It was very mean spirited. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=877.36s)]
*  I basically, I downloaded everyone's ID photos [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  from their ID cards. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=882.28s)]
*  I made this site where it showed two photos [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=883.6s)]
*  and you clicked on the person you thought was more attractive. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=887.96s)]
*  And then it used, and it basically took all the matchups [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=890.9200000000001s)]
*  and ranked everyone in the school based on [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=893.84s)]
*  who everyone thought was the most attractive. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=897.64s)]
*  Very mean spirited in retrospect. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=899.36s)]
*  Not connected to Facebook in any way. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=902.28s)]
*  But just like a- [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=904.2s)]
*  Just like a college kid kind of being a jerk. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  But it's like, okay, so that was not my best move. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=909.12s)]
*  But you gotta take, it's baby steps. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=914.48s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=917.36s)]
*  And also pretty cool to make something. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=918.2s)]
*  Some of the things I did were useful and fun. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  That one, I put it together in a weekend. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=922.64s)]
*  Not my best work. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=925.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, not my best work. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=926.24s)]
*  That's fair, not your best work. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=928.48s)]
*  Not my best work. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=930.6s)]
*  Yeah, we've all had things we made [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=931.44s)]
*  that weren't the best probably. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=932.28s)]
*  Did you, let me think what I'm gonna ask you. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=934.2s)]
*  Oh, did you, what kind of car do you drive? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=937.16s)]
*  What kind of car do you drive? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=942.4399999999999s)]
*  Right now, Blackwing CT5. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=944.12s)]
*  Ooh, what is it? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=947.8s)]
*  I mean, it's a Cadillac, it's nice. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, it is? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=950.4399999999999s)]
*  It's- [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=951.28s)]
*  Cadillac? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=952.0999999999999s)]
*  Here, pull it up. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=953.12s)]
*  It's, I really like driving manual transmission cars. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=953.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, huh? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=957.5999999999999s)]
*  And- [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=958.56s)]
*  I like that type of thing, baby. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=960.16s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=962.04s)]
*  Ooh, God, that's nice. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=964.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=966.4s)]
*  That thing will just shift. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=967.5999999999999s)]
*  That thing will just get shifty out there. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=968.92s)]
*  No, it's good, it's good. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=970.76s)]
*  It's gonna go nice to my ass on it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=972.28s)]
*  You want your, I feel like you want your car [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=973.12s)]
*  to have almost as much horsepower as your helicopter, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=975.16s)]
*  I feel like is a rule of thumb. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=978.88s)]
*  It's probably a rule of a very rich thumb. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=981.48s)]
*  Yeah, definitely, yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=983.84s)]
*  So for a while, okay, so my security team [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=986.3199999999999s)]
*  kinda convinced me for like 10 years [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=989.48s)]
*  that I should just let them drive me places, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=992.64s)]
*  which I mean, realistically I probably should, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=996.12s)]
*  but then eventually I was just like, I can't, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=998.2s)]
*  I can't do this. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1002.2s)]
*  It's like I need the freedom, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1003.88s)]
*  I need to be able to drive myself. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1005.72s)]
*  So I started learning how to fly helicopters. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1006.76s)]
*  And then as a car, well this is just ridiculous. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1010.28s)]
*  It's like we have the security team [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1013.4s)]
*  driving me to my helicopter that I then go fly away. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1014.88s)]
*  It's like, that makes no sense. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1017.7s)]
*  It's like, I'll just, let's just go, let's get a car. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1020.4s)]
*  It's kinda bat-man, it's almost as a bat-man vibe, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1022.8s)]
*  but I guess it is true, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1025.0s)]
*  because then you're just by yourself out there. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1026.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1028.28s)]
*  Or you take somebody with you in the car. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1029.12s)]
*  Oh no, no, no, in the car or the helicopter? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1029.96s)]
*  In the helicopter. Helicopter, yeah, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1031.96s)]
*  definitely have like a real professional pilot fly with me. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1033.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1036.48s)]
*  Oh, that's wild though. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1037.52s)]
*  But I guess a chopper would get you somewhere [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1039.16s)]
*  pretty quick, right? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1040.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a good tool to have in the arsenal. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1042.6s)]
*  Unreal. Yeah, no, it's, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1045.64s)]
*  California- You're like a damn emperor, dude. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1047.12s)]
*  Does that feel like that ever? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1048.88s)]
*  No, no. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1050.12s)]
*  Man, it's like, I feel like I wish that people did [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1051.76s)]
*  what I wanted them to do. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1054.64s)]
*  That would be fun, but in the meantime, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1056.48s)]
*  you can have some fun. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1057.76s)]
*  Yeah. Oh yeah, I would have a chopper. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  I'd have a, I don't even know what I would have. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  I would have an underground tunnel, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  even though it came right back up next to where it started. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  I do have an underground tunnel. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1067.04s)]
*  Do you really? Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1068.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1070.1999999999998s)]
*  In USA? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1071.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, there's this ranch in Kauai, yeah, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1072.0s)]
*  where there's this whole thing where people are like, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1074.4399999999998s)]
*  there's this whole meme about how people are saying [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1076.32s)]
*  I built this bunker underground. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1078.7199999999998s)]
*  It's more of underground storage type situation. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1080.7199999999998s)]
*  Bring it up. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1083.1599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, no, it's a- [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1084.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1087.2s)]
*  Zucky got that bonky. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1088.84s)]
*  What's under the ground is just more water, right? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1090.72s)]
*  It's basically what you just said. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1093.36s)]
*  It's sort of a tunnel that just goes to another building. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1094.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1098.68s)]
*  It's a good place to hide a little bit of dope though. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1101.6s)]
*  That's what I would say, dude. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1103.64s)]
*  Those are the good, that's what I would do anyway, but- [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1105.4s)]
*  You and I defer there. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1109.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1110.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1111.76s)]
*  You've never used drugs or- [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1113.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1114.32s)]
*  D.A.R.E. really worked on me. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1115.52s)]
*  When I was in third grade, it's like, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know, there's all this stuff about how it backfired [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1118.6s)]
*  and it just kind of taught people how to use drugs. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1121.8s)]
*  For me, it really scared me. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  It was like, I don't, no, I don't like any of that stuff. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1126.28s)]
*  It's like, a friend will show up and be like, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1128.1999999999998s)]
*  oh, I was getting an IV to feel better. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1129.8s)]
*  It's like, I don't even want people to extend their arm [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1132.6s)]
*  and show me their vein. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  It's like, that shit, no, not me. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1136.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, dude. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1138.1999999999998s)]
*  No, I'm raw dogging reality, is what I'm saying. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1139.32s)]
*  God. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1141.3999999999999s)]
*  There's kind of a, that's kind of insane really these days. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1143.08s)]
*  It used to be kind of that somebody who was like [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1146.36s)]
*  really straight edge and sober, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1148.84s)]
*  that that was a nerdy thing, I think. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1150.48s)]
*  But now, I never even thought about it for, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1153.36s)]
*  now that's almost the most insane thing you can do. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1156.16s)]
*  It's like, wait, you're under the influence of nothing. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  Nothing, nothing. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1162.8s)]
*  From sunup to sundown, you're a fucking animal, you know? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1163.96s)]
*  It's kind of crazy that things have gone, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1169.0s)]
*  that the perspective of that has kind of changed. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1171.52s)]
*  How big is that tunnel? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1176.56s)]
*  Is your tunnel pretty big or what's it like? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1177.52s)]
*  It's not that big of a tunnel. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1179.48s)]
*  I made a, I put a reel on Instagram one day of Priscilla [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1181.16s)]
*  kind of making fun of me playing video games [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1185.6399999999999s)]
*  with some friends down there. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1187.76s)]
*  But it's, yeah, no, it's all good. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1188.76s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1194.28s)]
*  But this is a crazy area. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1195.16s)]
*  I haven't spent a lot of time. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1196.12s)]
*  You know how the internet is. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1196.96s)]
*  The internet will always make things seem like [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1197.8799999999999s)]
*  they're crazier than they are. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1200.32s)]
*  But you know, what's an under, I mean, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1201.8s)]
*  in Hawaii it's like having a little storm shelter [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1203.96s)]
*  underground tunnel's pretty sweet. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1207.1599999999999s)]
*  That's the thing right there? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1208.0s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1209.84s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1211.36s)]
*  Is that Roblox? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1212.6799999999998s)]
*  Who built it for you? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  Looks closer to Roblox than what the thing is. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1216.0s)]
*  Dude, the future's, things are definitely [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1219.48s)]

*  It's good, yeah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1237.88s)]
*  No, I think that there's the self-driving car [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1238.72s)]
*  that's like hunting down the guy who was mean to it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's good. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1242.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it seemed like. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1244.0s)]
*  Dude, there was four. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1245.8s)]
*  I don't know if they were smoking a blunt or whatever. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1246.64s)]
*  But there was four Waymos all meeting. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1248.0800000000002s)]

*  I'm like, who are they? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1252.24s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1253.4s)]
*  And then my buddy said he was in one [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  and it was crying to him because it like. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1257.76s)]
*  The Waymo was crying? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1260.8s)]
*  Yeah, the Waymo was like complaining [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1261.72s)]
*  about his spouse or whatever. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1263.28s)]
*  And it was like. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1264.48s)]
*  What form does that take? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1265.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1266.68s)]
*  Is it like speaking English or is it like R2D2? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1267.52s)]
*  No, I think he had set it on a British setting. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1269.56s)]
*  So it was like, oh, me missus is really getting at me, no. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1271.4s)]
*  So I think, cause you can change the voice [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1274.76s)]
*  to like Indian guy or British guy or whatever, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1276.32s)]
*  or like female or semi-female or whatever. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1278.8s)]
*  Semi-female. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1282.6s)]
*  But like, yeah, I just think it like, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1283.72s)]
*  yeah, just some of that Waymo stuff's just getting out of line. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1286.72s)]
*  I never thought like, oh, what are these cars doing [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1289.0s)]
*  until I saw four of them meeting up? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1291.92s)]
*  And I was like, this seems like a lot to me. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1295.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1297.68s)]
*  That's where the future starts to get a little bit scary [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1298.64s)]
*  is moments like that where you're like, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1300.44s)]
*  what are they doing? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1301.72s)]
*  What were they doing? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1303.4s)]
*  Probably just waiting to pick people up. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1305.16s)]
*  But they'd have to do it in a group behind an Ikea? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1307.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1310.76s)]
*  That does seem like an unlikely place to pick people up. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1312.56s)]
*  That's true. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1314.64s)]
*  And well, it just seems. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1315.48s)]
*  It's not going to defend them. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1316.84s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1317.6799999999998s)]
*  It just seemed like an interesting place to meet up, you know? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1319.36s)]
*  Yeah, and then I was in one Waymo [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1323.48s)]
*  and it was like, you want to gamble? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1326.12s)]
*  And I think it was like sponsored by DraftKings or something. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1328.1599999999999s)]
*  It was like, you want to gamble with me? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1330.24s)]

*  you'll never get where you're going. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1335.72s)]
*  And it was like, this is, this seems like. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1337.32s)]
*  As the doors lock? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1339.32s)]
*  It's like picks up speed. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1340.84s)]
*  And why are all the Waymos white too? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1343.84s)]
*  This is, I don't know. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1346.36s)]
*  I just think we gotta start to diversify the portfolio, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1348.12s)]

*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1360.6s)]
*  I mean, there's no way that you're less nervous than me. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1361.6799999999998s)]
*  Let me think about how you said that. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1367.56s)]

*  Really? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1374.0s)]
*  But I think that's a trap. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1374.84s)]
*  I think that I am, I think I'm more nervous than you. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1375.8799999999999s)]

*  I don't know, well, I mean, college, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1612.24s)]
*  there's a question of how much of it is about the learning [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1615.5200000000002s)]
*  and how much of it is about the kind of like learning [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1617.96s)]
*  how to be a grownup before you kind of go out into the world. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1621.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, for me, it's like the classes were fine. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1627.72s)]
*  I mean, that was fun, sort of entertaining part of college, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1630.96s)]
*  but I mean, I met a lot of people [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1633.8000000000002s)]
*  who were really important in my life, right? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1635.2800000000002s)]
*  It's like, I'm in Priscilla, my co-founders at the company, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1636.8s)]
*  a bunch of people who are still friends, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1641.28s)]
*  close friends to this day. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1642.72s)]
*  So I think that's almost more of it [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1645.48s)]
*  than like whatever class you took. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1649.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1654.52s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1656.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's social, it's learning to be around others, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1657.1599999999999s)]
*  learning to not be at your parents' house. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1660.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I went to boarding school for two years, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1662.1599999999999s)]
*  and then before I went to college for two years. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1665.24s)]
*  So I feel like even though I dropped out of college, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1667.6000000000001s)]
*  I kind of got a full experience in a way on that, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  but it was good. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1674.72s)]
*  I feel like you just like, you know, you need some time [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1675.5600000000002s)]
*  kind of away from home a bit before you like fully go out. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1678.1200000000001s)]
*  But so I don't know, I think that'll be a thing, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1681.2800000000002s)]
*  but I do think like a lot of people, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1686.4s)]
*  I'm not sure that college is preparing people [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1689.1200000000001s)]
*  for like the jobs that they need to have today. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1691.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think that that's like, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1692.92s)]
*  there's a big issue on that, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1693.8s)]
*  and like all the student debt issues [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1694.84s)]
*  are like really big issues. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1696.76s)]
*  I mean, the fact that college is just so expensive [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1698.56s)]
*  for so many people, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1701.28s)]
*  and then like you graduate and you're in debt. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1702.12s)]
*  Well, you're not even guaranteed a job [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1705.28s)]
*  either you would think at a certain rate you're paying, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1706.56s)]
*  you'd be guaranteed some sort of beginner employment. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1709.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that's probably the biggest issue with it [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1712.6s)]
*  is it would be one thing if it were just kind of like [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1715.68s)]
*  a social experience, but you started off neutral. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1717.8s)]
*  The fact, if it's not preparing you for the jobs [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1720.64s)]
*  that you need and you're kind of starting off [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1722.96s)]
*  in this big hole, then I think that's not good. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1724.76s)]
*  I mean, that I think there's gonna have to be [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1728.3600000000001s)]
*  a reckoning with. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1729.88s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1730.72s)]
*  People are gonna have to kind of figure out [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1731.56s)]
*  whether that makes sense. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1732.96s)]
*  But I don't know, people, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1733.88s)]
*  it's sort of been this taboo thing to say of like, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1736.24s)]
*  maybe not everyone needs to go to college, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1739.16s)]
*  because there's like a lot of jobs that don't require that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1742.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1744.48s)]
*  But I think people are probably coming around [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1745.72s)]
*  to that opinion a little more now [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1748.2s)]
*  than maybe like 10 years ago. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1749.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1752.04s)]
*  I was just talking earlier with Colin, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1753.8000000000002s)]
*  I think one of your assistants, one of your coworkers, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1756.2s)]
*  sorry, I didn't say assistants, but, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1757.96s)]
*  and we're kind of saying that, yeah, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1760.2800000000002s)]
*  like what classes do you think kids should be learning now? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1764.2800000000002s)]
*  Because with AI coming along and with technology [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1768.16s)]
*  starting to really multiply itself pretty quickly, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1771.96s)]
*  like our ability to advance is gonna only grow faster, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1777.0400000000002s)]
*  it seems like. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1780.88s)]
*  Do you guys feel like that's true, overall statement? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1781.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, totally. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it's accelerating. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1784.44s)]
*  Accelerating, yeah, that's the word I'm looking for, sorry. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1785.72s)]
*  So with that happening, what are, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1787.64s)]
*  I feel like they should be teaching how to kind of use AI [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1789.88s)]
*  to children right now in elementary and middle schools. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1793.24s)]
*  Does that, that sounds very real to me. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1796.32s)]
*  Do you feel like that that's, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1798.24s)]
*  like not how to code or anything, but just how to do it? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1799.96s)]
*  So I mean, it's interesting [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1803.04s)]
*  because the technology changes a lot, right? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1803.88s)]
*  It's obviously, it's a lot different now [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1806.0s)]
*  than it was 20 years ago when I got started with the company [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1807.44s)]
*  or when I started coding when I was a kid. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1810.24s)]
*  So it's not like the specific things I learned to code [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1812.68s)]
*  when I was 15 are the skills I'm using today, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1816.2s)]
*  but you, I don't know, I think that there is something [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1820.44s)]
*  about kind of understanding the technology [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1825.68s)]
*  and understanding how to use it and getting on that train [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1829.24s)]
*  that I think is valuable. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1832.32s)]
*  But the other thing is I just think [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1833.8s)]
*  like having good mentors or teachers, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1835.6s)]
*  no matter what the actual class is, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1838.28s)]
*  like when I was in boarding school, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1840.4s)]
*  I really liked studying Latin and Greek. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1844.44s)]
*  And that's like not useful for any practical thing, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1847.76s)]
*  but it's like, but it's fun. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1851.92s)]
*  And like, it's fun. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1854.76s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1856.32s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1857.16s)]
*  I think there are parts of it that are fun for sure. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1858.0s)]
*  And the tests that I had to take were, you know, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1859.88s)]
*  it's they would, you know, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1863.6s)]
*  you'd be reading these kind of great works [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1864.52s)]
*  and the test would be, they'd pull out any word [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1867.36s)]
*  in like whatever the third of a book was [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1872.1599999999999s)]
*  that was kind of that kind of section of the class. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1875.28s)]
*  And they'd like show you a sentence [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1878.4799999999998s)]
*  and then they'd say, okay, this word, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1880.7199999999998s)]
*  like give us the full kind of grammatical [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1883.36s)]
*  and like poetic significance of kind of how this word [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1886.84s)]
*  is used by this author in this piece. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1893.04s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1896.48s)]
*  I'm not like, I'm not that good at language. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1897.76s)]
*  So the way that I did that class was I basically just sat [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1901.0s)]
*  and studied word by word, the like historical significance [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1905.88s)]
*  of each word over like tens of pages, you know, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1910.48s)]
*  preparing for these exams. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1915.0s)]
*  And okay, I don't remember that much of that [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1916.92s)]
*  at this point, right? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1919.72s)]
*  I mean, there were a few quotes that I think are pretty good [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1920.56s)]
*  from some of those books, but, and I put them on shirts, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1922.0s)]
*  but, but. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1924.8s)]
*  Have you, you plural of a soon, have you heard that one? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1925.64s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's a good one. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1927.8s)]
*  What does that one mean? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1928.64s)]
*  Let's ball out or whatever. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1929.48s)]
*  From, from many one. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1930.68s)]
*  I think it's talking about how we come together [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1932.4s)]
*  as a people or a states into one union. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1934.4s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1937.68s)]
*  You know, but no, I. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1938.52s)]
*  But so you did it word by word, but it still helped you. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1942.92s)]
*  But I just think like the lesson from that is, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1945.76s)]
*  you know, it kind of gave me this confidence [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1949.48s)]
*  that it's like, okay, that was like a crazy thing to do. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1951.12s)]
*  To have to like, go learn what every word's significance, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1954.1200000000001s)]
*  like poetic significance and grammatical structure [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1957.2s)]
*  and all that is. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1960.52s)]
*  And after I took that class, I was basically like, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1962.6000000000001s)]
*  I can work hard enough to do anything that I want, right? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1965.88s)]
*  Because like, I just like fucking learned all these words [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1969.0s)]
*  that don't matter in order to like nail this thing. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1973.64s)]
*  And like, and I won and kind of did that and got that to, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1978.8s)]
*  to kind of, and kind of had some fun doing it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1982.68s)]
*  So. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1985.88s)]
*  Well, it's like you, like you found a model kind of. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1986.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  And it was hard. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1990.2s)]
*  It was a, it was a tough model. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1991.16s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, there's like, there's that. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1992.88s)]
*  I mean, there's like the math version of that. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1995.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about Alexander Weing on here. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  It's like, I mean, I did a bunch of the same kind [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=1998.48s)]
*  of math competitions that, that he did. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2000.8400000000001s)]
*  I had this like super hardcore math instructor [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2002.88s)]
*  in high school. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2006.96s)]
*  His name was Zooming Feng. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2007.7800000000002s)]
*  And he. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2009.76s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2010.6000000000001s)]
*  Chinese guy? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2011.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2013.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think at some point he, he had worked with. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2013.96s)]
*  Zooming Feng, bring him up, baby. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2019.0s)]
*  Zooming Feng, now he is. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  We want the Feng, you ever hear that song [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2021.28s)]
*  that we used to play that? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2023.4s)]
*  Well, this guy is just like a badass. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2024.24s)]
*  And he basically was involved in training [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2025.96s)]
*  the U.S. Math Olympiad team for a long period of time. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2028.6000000000001s)]
*  And he made a huge impact on me kind of growing up. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2034.2s)]
*  And he kind of taught me a little bit about like [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2038.8s)]
*  how I approach problems. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2043.6399999999999s)]
*  He's like, look, you actually, it's like, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2045.0s)]
*  it's like you kind of have this, it's like, look, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2049.56s)]
*  you're not that good at math. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2053.32s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, but I'm kidding. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2054.36s)]
*  He kind of taught me that I had this sort of like [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2058.84s)]
*  intuitive ability to have a sense of like [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2061.4s)]
*  what zone the right answer was in. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2064.72s)]
*  So he's like, I look at your work [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2066.8s)]
*  and you do a bunch of stuff that like [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2069.56s)]
*  doesn't really make sense. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2072.2799999999997s)]
*  But then at the end, you come to a conclusion [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2073.8399999999997s)]
*  and you realize that that conclusion doesn't make sense. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2075.9199999999996s)]
*  And then you kind of check yourself and go back and do it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2077.9199999999996s)]
*  And you keep on doing it until you get the right answer. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2080.16s)]
*  He's like, I don't understand how you like [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2082.64s)]
*  have this intuitive sense for like [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2084.96s)]
*  what the shape of the right answer is, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2086.52s)]
*  but like that's really good. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2088.2s)]
*  As long as you like couple that with working really hard, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2089.56s)]
*  you're gonna be able to kind of succeed [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2091.68s)]
*  and get a lot done. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2093.56s)]
*  So that gives you a map of how to navigate yourself, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2096.68s)]
*  like your intuition with your hard work. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2098.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2100.3999999999996s)]
*  So okay, like does the specific like, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2101.7999999999997s)]
*  high dimensional geometry or whatever the thing is [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  that we were working on together, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2109.24s)]
*  like do I do any of that today? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2110.48s)]
*  No, I don't remember any of that stuff. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2112.52s)]
*  But like, but I think it's like, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2114.8399999999997s)]
*  like you have some good teachers who teach you how to think [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2116.04s)]
*  and how to work hard and like that stays with you forever. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2120.4399999999996s)]
*  And I think that that's like some of the stuff that, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2124.2s)]
*  I mean, I think it builds confidence. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2128.72s)]
*  It like teaches you how you approach problems. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2130.7599999999998s)]
*  Then you just get better and better at some things [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2132.68s)]
*  and you build confidence. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2134.7599999999998s)]
*  So that's the value you're saying and seeing in college. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2136.4s)]
*  Like those are some of the other values you might not see. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2138.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think so. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2141.4s)]
*  Might not be able to be seen on paper, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2142.3199999999997s)]
*  but the value of that, yeah, that's a good point, man. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2144.12s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I remember like some of my favorite people [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2147.2799999999997s)]
*  still to this day in my life have been some of my teachers [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2149.92s)]
*  that challenged me or that believed in me [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2152.12s)]
*  or that said a certain, like, man, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2154.84s)]
*  I admire the way you do this or this, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2156.7999999999997s)]
*  and it really encourages you and wants, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2158.88s)]
*  kind of plants a lot of seeds to make you wanna do those [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2162.0s)]
*  things so much more. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2164.12s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't have to be teachers, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2165.36s)]
*  although obviously, that's- [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2167.0s)]
*  Or mentors. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2168.48s)]
*  I think a lot of these days, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2169.3199999999997s)]
*  a lot of people get their mentorship probably, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2170.72s)]
*  I would guess from teachers, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2172.3199999999997s)]
*  unless they play a sport. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2173.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the main way that you learn those [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2174.68s)]
*  from colleagues, right? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2177.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like people you work with. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2178.64s)]
*  And I remember growing up, I was really into computers. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2181.52s)]
*  Like when did you get your first computer, you think? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2187.48s)]
*  So my family had a computer probably when I was like [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2191.4s)]
*  eight or nine, and then I think I probably got one. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2195.2s)]
*  And would you be in there on that thing all the time, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2199.04s)]
*  just riding the keys? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2200.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so my dad's a dentist. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2201.64s)]
*  And he's like- [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2203.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, I just got a tooth yesterday. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2204.2s)]
*  Yeah, how's that? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2206.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2206.84s)]
*  I just got a half of a- [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2207.68s)]
*  Gotta see Dr. Zuckerberg. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2209.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2210.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, he'll take care of you. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2211.52s)]
*  Did your parents give you love or just sonic care? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2215.04s)]
*  That's just an old dentist joke. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2218.64s)]
*  Glad you got that taken care of. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2220.52s)]
*  Yeah, I feel a lot better about it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2221.56s)]
*  But what were we talking about? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2223.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I was just talking about how, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2224.8s)]
*  my dad was the type of dentist who like, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2226.2400000000002s)]
*  was really into technology. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2229.1600000000003s)]
*  So whenever like a new laser thing came out [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2230.96s)]
*  to like drill your teeth better, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2233.48s)]
*  like he was on that first, right? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2235.04s)]
*  And that was kind of cool to be around, right? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2237.92s)]
*  And kind of see, like he clearly, he loved technology. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2240.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think I sort of got introduced [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2246.12s)]
*  to a bunch of stuff through that. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2248.12s)]
*  So like he had, like in his dental office, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2249.12s)]
*  there were like a bunch of different, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2251.08s)]
*  operatory rooms, I guess. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2255.4s)]
*  And they each had computers and I was like, all right. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2256.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, it feels like the future in there. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2261.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, but it was still, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2263.16s)]
*  he'd still like go between them [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2266.12s)]
*  to talk to the different people. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2267.48s)]
*  I was like, you need like a chat app. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2268.6s)]
*  So you can just like send messages [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2271.04s)]
*  to everyone across the dental office. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2272.32s)]
*  So I like wrote that for him. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2274.56s)]
*  And it's like, all right, that's cool. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2275.68s)]
*  So you were coding, you were putting coding [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2278.12s)]
*  into like dental work. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2280.52s)]
*  You were already thinking of how to connect things. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2281.84s)]
*  I just like making stuff. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2283.68s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2284.8s)]
*  I mean, that's sort of been the theme for me [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2286.32s)]
*  is the intersection between like computing technology [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2288.6s)]
*  on the one hand and like people and connecting people. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2292.56s)]
*  You know, when I was in college, I wasn't there for long, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2297.48s)]
*  but I mean, I was technically a psychology major. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2299.72s)]
*  I mean, I took a bunch of computer science [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2302.24s)]
*  and math classes too, but. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2303.6s)]
*  Dude, if somebody even went to Harvard for four days, dude, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2305.68s)]
*  I would hire him to be my therapist or whatever. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2308.68s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2311.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2313.08s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't know. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2313.92s)]
*  I think I'd rather have someone who, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2315.64s)]
*  I definitely subscribe to the theory of like, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2318.16s)]
*  you want people who did well at whatever they did, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2320.8s)]
*  not just like who have some random credential. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2323.04s)]
*  So. Oh yeah. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2325.2400000000002s)]
*  So. Yeah, I guess, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2326.6800000000003s)]
*  but Ron, if you heard Harvard, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2327.52s)]
*  it was like somebody had gone to like Mars or something. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2329.1200000000003s)]
*  It was very, you know. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2331.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, I get it. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2333.32s)]
*  So, but I think so it kind of differs from place to place. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2334.1600000000003s)]
*  Whenever you drop, whenever you, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2336.88s)]
*  did you have to tell your parents [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2338.28s)]
*  you were dropping out of college? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2339.4s)]
*  Was that a crazy day? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2340.44s)]
*  Did you DM them or what'd you do? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  So, I mean, I'd already started Facebook [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2344.2400000000002s)]
*  and Harvard had this nice policy where you, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2346.84s)]
*  you didn't have to make a hard decision to drop out. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2349.32s)]
*  You could just postpone. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2351.6800000000003s)]
*  So, I just didn't go back for the next term. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2352.76s)]
*  But later, my mom told me that she always knew [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2354.44s)]
*  I wasn't gonna finish college. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2359.36s)]
*  I was like, mom, the hell does that mean? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2360.48s)]
*  But no, but actually. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2362.92s)]
*  But that's gotta be the worst. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2365.0s)]
*  Imagine this, okay? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2365.84s)]
*  Say your son or child or daughter or mixed, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2366.6800000000003s)]
*  or mixed child or whatever. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2370.2400000000002s)]
*  Imagine it's a big test at school, right? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2371.84s)]
*  You have to hug your kid goodbye. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2374.1600000000003s)]
*  You know your kid is not gonna do good [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2375.36s)]
*  on that test, right? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2378.36s)]
*  But you still have to stay in there in the kitchen [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2379.52s)]
*  and give him a little bit of chocolate milk [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2381.32s)]
*  and be like, you're gonna do good out there today, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2383.0s)]
*  Benny, or whatever his name is, right? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2384.88s)]
*  But then the second he leaves, you're just like, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2386.76s)]
*  I could have a shirt. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2388.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, Benny's screwed. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2390.32s)]
*  Yeah, Benny's screwed. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2392.52s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2395.48s)]
*  I don't know what we're talking about. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2397.0s)]
*  I know what it's like. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2397.84s)]
*  No, but my younger sister. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2398.6800000000003s)]
*  Is our conversation going okay? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2401.32s)]
*  I feel like it's cool, you. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2402.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, this is, yeah. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2403.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's less random than I expected it to be. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2404.76s)]
*  You know? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2406.92s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2408.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just hard to talk sometimes to people. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2409.84s)]
*  No, before I went to college, my, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2412.7200000000003s)]
*  no, my mom, I think, told me that she thought [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2415.7200000000003s)]
*  I was gonna drop out. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2418.6400000000003s)]
*  My younger sister bet me that she was gonna finish [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2420.2000000000003s)]
*  college before me. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2422.4s)]
*  Ooh, I like that attitude. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2423.44s)]
*  And I was like, now I'm gonna get a degree. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2424.8s)]
*  And they all came true. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2427.1600000000003s)]
*  I dropped out, my younger sister finished college, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2428.36s)]
*  and then I got an honorary degree. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2430.36s)]
*  So, you know, bonus. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2431.44s)]

*  So my activities with her is like, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2868.6s)]
*  we'll usually like go through the news [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2872.2799999999997s)]
*  and I'll find, she'll find like one thing, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2874.36s)]
*  pick out a story and then we'll just like talk about it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2878.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's really interesting. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2880.48s)]
*  Cause like, it hadn't occurred to me before [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2882.28s)]
*  how much in order to understand like technology, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2885.0800000000004s)]
*  you need to really understand like government [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2890.2000000000003s)]
*  and civics and politics and law [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2892.52s)]
*  and like all of these different things. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2895.6400000000003s)]
*  So trying to explain to like a child [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2897.1600000000003s)]
*  who hasn't thought much about these things [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2900.96s)]
*  is, it's both very fascinating for me, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2905.28s)]
*  but it's just been like a cool bonding experience of like, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2909.8s)]
*  and you start off and it's like a really basic understanding [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2913.1200000000003s)]
*  but then after you've done it for like a year or two, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2915.56s)]
*  like, okay, she has like a very good understanding [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2917.96s)]
*  of like the tech industry and the world and all this stuff. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2920.32s)]
*  And it's pretty interesting to talk through. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2923.92s)]
*  One thing that's inspiring just to even parents to hear [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2927.52s)]
*  like, what can you talk to your kid about? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2929.6000000000004s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2931.4s)]
*  Like if your kid's 13 years still reading the same bears [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2932.4s)]
*  or whatever, some of that's on you. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2935.76s)]
*  Like you got to evolve some of the curriculum [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2937.6400000000003s)]
*  for your child, you know? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2940.32s)]
*  Because yeah, a lot of parents think you probably can't [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2942.44s)]
*  kind of build these worlds in a child's head [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2944.48s)]
*  but if you start with the basic blocks, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2947.04s)]
*  then you kind of can, you know, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2949.4s)]
*  and help them get bigger ideas about things. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2950.6800000000003s)]
*  I think that's cool. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2953.32s)]
*  I think there's nothing more important [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2954.2400000000002s)]
*  than how a parent communicates with their child, you know, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2955.6400000000003s)]
*  and what they communicate to them. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2957.88s)]
*  Because so often we just expect like teachers [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2959.56s)]
*  and different curriculum out in the world [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2962.64s)]
*  or just the world to do that for our children. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2963.76s)]
*  But man, I think the biggest faucet for a child [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2966.36s)]
*  is the parent, you know? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2969.52s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2972.52s)]
*  And the little one is just a little. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2973.36s)]
*  Just two, we got a bonus. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2975.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's, no, she's good. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2978.52s)]
*  But I mean, obviously very, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2981.24s)]
*  she's just obsessed with her older sisters. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2983.4s)]
*  Like so one day she just decided like, I am not a baby. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2985.72s)]
*  And we're like, oh, you're the family baby. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=2990.52s)]

*  She goes, I'm a bit girl. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3005.88s)]
*  It's like, okay. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3007.84s)]
*  It's like, well, maybe learn how to pronounce it first [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3008.92s)]
*  and then I'll believe you. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3010.92s)]
*  But no, she's like, I weigh six terabytes. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3012.04s)]

*  I don't know, I think like, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3230.16s)]
*  it's just good for them to have good role models, right? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3231.08s)]
*  You know, part of the way that I, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3235.2799999999997s)]
*  I feel like when kids grow up, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3238.6s)]
*  they either end up wanting to like marry people [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3240.52s)]
*  who are the opposite of their parents [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3244.72s)]
*  if it was a bad experience, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3246.2s)]
*  or people who they like think of as sort of like, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3247.8799999999997s)]
*  oh, this was a good role model, right? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3250.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I feel like as long as they look up to us, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3252.3199999999997s)]
*  that's like, that's kind of the, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3255.32s)]
*  hmm, that's, you want to like set a good example, right? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3257.36s)]
*  So, but I don't know. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3260.7200000000003s)]
*  I kind of, for me, we talked about this a little bit with, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3262.96s)]
*  with the fighting stuff early on, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3267.6800000000003s)]
*  but for me, it's always just been important that it's like, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3270.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't just want to like be a person [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3274.7200000000003s)]
*  who like sits and works all the time. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3276.2000000000003s)]
*  I think like, you know, it's, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3277.88s)]
*  we're not like meant to just sit at a desk all day long, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3279.2000000000003s)]
*  and one day Oreo will learn that. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3282.52s)]
*  But, and I think like a lot of life is like, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3284.64s)]
*  you move around, you like, you know, it's like, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3288.08s)]
*  we're like meant to be active and do stuff. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3290.52s)]
*  And I think that that's a big part of it. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3293.68s)]
*  I try to, like, it's important to me that, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3295.3199999999997s)]
*  that the kids get that too. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3297.72s)]
*  And the kids are very active. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3299.16s)]
*  Do your kids have a lot of like screen time? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3302.2799999999997s)]
*  Like how much screen time do you allow your kids? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3306.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's different for the different ones. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3308.2799999999997s)]
*  We don't just like let them do whatever, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3310.8399999999997s)]
*  but I actually like want them to be fluent with this stuff. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3313.84s)]
*  And that kind of like we talked about earlier, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3317.84s)]
*  you know, I want them to learn how to code, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3320.7200000000003s)]
*  how to use technology. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3323.6000000000004s)]
*  I think it's important because a lot of socialization, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3325.76s)]
*  you know, obviously like happens online at this point. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3329.04s)]
*  Like people need to get used to the norms [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3331.36s)]
*  and stuff around that. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3333.48s)]
*  So, I mean, they're not on, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3334.32s)]
*  they're still too young to be using like social media, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3335.48s)]
*  but they have messenger kids. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3338.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, we make it so that they can video chat [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3340.44s)]
*  and chat with their friends. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3344.96s)]
*  And, you know, we'll obviously monitor to make sure [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3346.52s)]
*  that they're just connecting with the people [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3348.8s)]
*  who we think that they should. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3351.88s)]
*  But like, I think it's actually good. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3353.08s)]
*  I think people need to kind of grow up, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3354.92s)]
*  I don't need to as strong, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3358.4s)]
*  but I think it's good if you have an engaged parent [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3359.76s)]
*  and they, and as a child you learn up, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3365.1600000000003s)]
*  you kind of grow up learning how to use a bunch of this stuff. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3368.92s)]
*  So I think that that's all good. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3372.2000000000003s)]
*  I want the kids to the extent that they're interested in it [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3373.96s)]
*  to learn how to code, learn how to create stuff, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3377.12s)]
*  whether it's in like Horizon or VR tools, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3380.08s)]
*  or they play, you know, Roblox and Minecraft [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3382.96s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3385.8s)]
*  I think that's good. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3386.64s)]
*  And then, you know, there's a lot of educational [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3387.46s)]
*  study type tools that, you know, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3390.12s)]
*  when our daughter's studying for her competitions [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3392.88s)]
*  or whatever, she can kind of make a lot of progress on that. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3396.2799999999997s)]
*  So I think that that stuff is good, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3399.4799999999996s)]
*  but we're not just like letting them just kind of sit [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3401.12s)]
*  and watch stuff all day long. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3404.7999999999997s)]
*  So you think- [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3407.8799999999997s)]
*  Unless you're on a plane, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3408.72s)]
*  then you do whatever you need to do [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3409.54s)]
*  to get through that flight. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3411.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3412.68s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3414.56s)]
*  Somebody else needs to say that. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3415.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's- [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3416.72s)]
*  Where's the, I want to, when do we come out [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3418.3999999999996s)]
*  with that pacifier that really shuts these kids down [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3420.68s)]
*  for a couple hours? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3424.72s)]
*  I'm not saying there's anything crazy, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3426.16s)]
*  nothing illegal, but we need, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3428.2s)]
*  we need a high voltage pacifier back in society, Mark. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3430.6s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3434.04s)]
*  Give us something, brother. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3435.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3436.52s)]
*  These kids are screaming. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3437.36s)]
*  They sometimes do. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3438.6s)]
*  The craziest thing happened to me, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3442.08s)]
*  one time I'm on a plane, I'm dreaming, right? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3443.16s)]
*  And I'm like, man, I'm really having some nice dreams [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3446.7s)]
*  because I never have good sleep or anything. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3449.16s)]
*  So every now and then I come to the surface of my dreams [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3451.08s)]
*  and I'm like, wow, I'm still dreaming. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3453.7999999999997s)]
*  And I go back underwater. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3454.96s)]
*  But I heard a ukulele playing, right? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3457.6s)]
*  Ukulele and at some point I wake up [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3459.36s)]
*  and there is a effing child or child as some people call them [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3462.56s)]
*  playing a ukulele with his parents on this plane. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3467.88s)]
*  I walked up and I put my hand on it in front of the parents. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3473.0s)]
*  I think I was still groggy from being asleep. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3476.0s)]
*  And I was like, we can't do this today. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3477.56s)]
*  It's like the ukulele is, it's a- [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3480.88s)]
*  It's time out for ukulele. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3484.56s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3485.7599999999998s)]
*  We're shutting down this little hand Hawaii [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3486.7999999999997s)]
*  you got going on right here, brother. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3488.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it probably took a lot of restraint [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3490.08s)]
*  to not just pick up the ukulele and smash it. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3491.6s)]
*  Oh, it really did. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3493.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's- [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3494.7999999999997s)]
*  It really did. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3496.44s)]
*  So I just said, we're not doing this today. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3497.2799999999997s)]
*  In a tone that was- [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3499.12s)]
*  That seems stern for a child. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3500.44s)]
*  It was. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3503.0s)]
*  And both of your parents were right there. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3503.8399999999997s)]
*  Especially for a child who is not your child, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3504.68s)]
*  who you don't know. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3508.04s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3508.92s)]
*  That's the type of thing that you could cause a scene. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3509.7599999999998s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3511.52s)]
*  I got lucky. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3512.3599999999997s)]
*  And your parents were- [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3513.18s)]
*  They agreed. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3514.8599999999997s)]
*  They were probably pissed about the ukulele too. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3515.7s)]
*  But they were afraid to tell their kids something. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3517.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, so you did them a favor. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3519.1s)]

*  but tell us that- [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3531.62s)]
*  So I agree. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3532.46s)]

*  Yeah, I did. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3781.94s)]
*  Are those the ones you have on right now or no? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3782.78s)]
*  No, this is, I mean, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3784.5s)]
*  these are the ones that are available today. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3785.34s)]
*  These are like REI glasses. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3787.38s)]
*  So I mean, it's, you know, they're glasses. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3788.94s)]
*  They can, you know, the main thing is they can, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3791.34s)]
*  you can take photos or videos with them. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3795.22s)]
*  I love just using them for listening to music [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3797.4599999999996s)]
*  and taking phone calls on them [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3799.8599999999997s)]
*  because your ears are open, right? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3801.4199999999996s)]
*  So it doesn't like, it doesn't obscure your ability [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3803.5s)]
*  to hear anything else. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3805.2999999999997s)]
*  The audio quality is really good, right? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3807.3799999999997s)]
*  Cause it has a microphone, like it's a contact mic [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3809.1s)]
*  that's like basically in the nose pad. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3812.3399999999997s)]
*  Audio quality is great. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3814.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so when I'm like, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3815.2999999999997s)]
*  you can be on a plane and take a phone call [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3816.7799999999997s)]
*  and like the other person on the other side [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3819.54s)]
*  can't even hear that you're on a plane. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3821.52s)]
*  Like it's just like the, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3822.8999999999996s)]
*  you can be in a wind tunnel [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3823.74s)]
*  and it's just like, whatever. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3824.74s)]
*  It's the sound quality is amazing. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3825.66s)]
*  But then the main thing is they're AI glasses. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3828.06s)]
*  So you can, glasses I think are like [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3833.14s)]
*  the perfect form factor for a device [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3836.98s)]
*  where if you wanna have an AI that you let [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3839.98s)]
*  see what you see, hear what you hear, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3843.2599999999998s)]
*  it can talk to you. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3845.74s)]
*  You can talk to it throughout the day. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3846.58s)]
*  And glasses is that's like, yeah, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3849.46s)]
*  if you wanna have something that has the same context [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3851.74s)]
*  to the world that you do, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3853.78s)]
*  that's it's gonna be glasses. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3854.6200000000003s)]
*  And there's like, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3855.7000000000003s)]
*  there's like a billion or two billion people in the world [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3857.26s)]
*  who wear glasses already. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3859.34s)]
*  So to me, the chance that we look back like a decade [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3861.34s)]
*  from now and like all those glasses aren't AI glasses [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3866.38s)]
*  by that period, it's kind of like, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3871.46s)]
*  like obviously all the flip phones [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3873.46s)]
*  were gonna become smartphones, right? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3875.02s)]
*  I mean, that like, that was clearly a thing [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3876.7400000000002s)]
*  that was gonna happen. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3878.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that's gonna happen with glasses too. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3879.5400000000004s)]
*  But the other piece of this is that [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3883.26s)]
*  you're gonna get the ability to kind of put holograms [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3886.38s)]
*  in the world, right? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3889.2200000000003s)]
*  So our experience with technology today is, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3890.1400000000003s)]
*  I know it's kind of funny in a way how it's divided [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3895.1400000000003s)]
*  where it's like, you know, we have the physical world [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3897.0200000000004s)]
*  all around us. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3899.42s)]
*  And then if you wanna interact with something digital, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3900.82s)]
*  you need to like put a screen up, right? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3902.42s)]
*  So maybe it's like this, you know, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3903.82s)]
*  you have your small glowing rectangle, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3905.2200000000003s)]
*  your phone with you, you know, you have like, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3907.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, your screen if you wanna like project something. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3909.78s)]
*  Yeah, your computer. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3912.06s)]
*  But I think in the not too distant future, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3913.58s)]
*  this should be blended together, right? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3918.2999999999997s)]
*  You'll have like the physical world, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3919.7s)]
*  but all this digital stuff should just basically [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3921.2999999999997s)]
*  be holograms, you shouldn't need like a physical screen. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3923.66s)]
*  Like there's no reason why in the future, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3927.18s)]
*  you know, you wanna have a screen there, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3929.42s)]
*  you'll just have glasses [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3931.54s)]
*  and that screen will be a hologram. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3932.94s)]
*  Right, and that's what you put me in. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3934.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3936.46s)]
*  Somebody put me in it, yeah. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3937.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, that's- [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3938.14s)]
*  In the final season of Stranger Things back there. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3938.98s)]
*  I got put in whatever they put on me, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3941.46s)]
*  it was like Lenscrafters, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3944.7000000000003s)]
*  makes Lenscrafters look pretty, you know, lame. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3946.9s)]
*  Well, it's- [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3950.82s)]
*  It's different, it was, well, it was crazy. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3952.3s)]
*  I'll say it, it was like, can I say what happened on it? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3954.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3956.6600000000003s)]
*  It was, so they put it, you put the glasses on [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3957.6200000000003s)]
*  and it's like an advancement of the pair [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3961.3s)]
*  that you have on now, right? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3964.38s)]
*  So it's like years down the line. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3965.5s)]
*  How many years down the line [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3967.42s)]
*  do you realistically think that those could- [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3968.26s)]
*  I'm hoping that we'll have a version of that [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3971.34s)]
*  as a product in a few years, but it's going- [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3973.54s)]
*  Like four years or eight years? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3976.1800000000003s)]
*  Hopefully closer to four or even less, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3978.1800000000003s)]
*  but I think that there will still be [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3981.2200000000003s)]
*  simpler glasses like this [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3987.26s)]
*  and then there will be more complex glasses. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3988.6600000000003s)]
*  Those will be more expensive. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3990.34s)]
*  There's more technology- Right, what do you want kind of? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3991.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but so some people will want like more tech, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3992.82s)]
*  they'll want the holograms. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3995.26s)]
*  Some people just want a simple experience [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3996.6600000000003s)]
*  where it's like, all right, I got the AI, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3998.26s)]
*  I got the ability to listen to music [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=3999.54s)]
*  and phone calls and do all that. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4000.94s)]
*  And then obviously the less tech that you put into them, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4004.3s)]
*  the thinner they can be, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4006.78s)]
*  which I mean, some people like bulky glasses, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4008.58s)]
*  some people want thin glasses and- [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4010.74s)]
*  Yeah, it was fascinating. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4013.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4014.22s)]
*  They had a thing on my wrist, right? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4015.06s)]
*  Uh-huh, neural interface. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4017.22s)]
*  A neural interface? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4019.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you could basically control the glasses [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4020.22s)]
*  with your mind through signals that you're sending [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4023.22s)]
*  from your brain to your hand. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4026.1s)]
*  Yes, it was fascinating. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4028.38s)]
*  It was like, I could like touch different nodules [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4029.58s)]
*  that I needed to and stuff or different nodes, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4032.86s)]
*  whatever it's called. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4034.6600000000003s)]
*  I could look at certain things [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4035.5s)]
*  and that would highlight what it was. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4036.82s)]
*  And it was like a screen, it was just a screen in midair. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4038.26s)]
*  And I could walk around the side of the room [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4041.54s)]
*  and then come back and the screen would still be there, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4043.38s)]
*  but it wasn't really there in real life. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4045.3s)]
*  It was just there with the glasses on. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4047.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's a hologram. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4051.02s)]
*  Yes, and it was crazy, man. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4051.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4055.3s)]
*  And then I was like, well, my first thought was like, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4057.7400000000002s)]
*  well, how do you just get people to adapt to this? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4059.2200000000003s)]
*  Because people aren't just gonna go [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4061.38s)]
*  from where we are right now to adapt. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4062.94s)]
*  And then I realized, okay, there's different stair steps. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4065.3s)]
*  There's like, almost like when you got the first smartphone, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4067.6600000000003s)]
*  like you're saying, and then in advance, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4069.94s)]
*  or the first mobile phone, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4071.5s)]
*  and then you have the first meta glasses, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4072.6600000000003s)]
*  and then it advances and stuff like that. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4074.38s)]
*  So it was fascinating. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4076.0600000000004s)]
*  There was a part where me and another man, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4077.7000000000003s)]
*  who I just met him, and we played ping pong. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4079.5800000000004s)]
*  And I believe it was an Asian guy, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4083.82s)]
*  and I don't know if they did it on purpose or not, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4085.1000000000004s)]
*  and I don't know if ping pong is Asian, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4086.98s)]
*  but people think it is. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4088.2200000000003s)]
*  And I started playing with this man back there. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4090.3s)]
*  And the table. Did you win? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4092.94s)]
*  Huh? Did you win? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4094.78s)]
*  Dude, who knows? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4095.62s)]
*  We're in the future. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4096.46s)]
*  I don't know if they keep score. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4097.28s)]
*  I think everybody gets a medal. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4098.12s)]
*  No, you definitely keep score. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4098.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, you do? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4099.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and in our future, not everyone gets a medal. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4100.78s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4102.900000000001s)]
*  No, it's, who are you not in your day? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4104.22s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's more, yeah. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4106.7s)]
*  Oreo, fire up the grill. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4108.54s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4110.74s)]
*  Loser burns. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4113.1s)]
*  But no, the, but we could play a game of, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4114.38s)]
*  and it was a not real, it was a ping pong table [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4119.06s)]
*  in front of us that was not real. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4121.5s)]
*  Like 3D ping pong. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4123.34s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4124.5s)]
*  So it wasn't there. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4125.34s)]
*  Someone could ride their bike through it, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4127.78s)]
*  like your dumb brother could ride his fricking bike. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4129.22s)]
*  Like, dang it. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4131.86s)]
*  Ricky, bro, you fricking rode right through our net. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4133.3s)]
*  So, I mean, I think it's an interesting thought experiment, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4137.34s)]
*  how many of the things that we physically have. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4139.82s)]
*  That's what's fascinating to me. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4142.8s)]
*  That we need to be there in the future. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4143.64s)]
*  So pretty much every screen doesn't need to be there. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4145.04s)]
*  It'll just be a hologram, any media, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4148.12s)]
*  any book that you're playing, any board game, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4150.76s)]
*  any cards, those are. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4152.92s)]
*  That'd be nice, because one thing I hate is at the airport, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4155.0s)]
*  all these TVs are on, it's like everything is so loud now. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4157.08s)]
*  It's like, can you just make it for you? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4160.64s)]
*  Just turn it down. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4163.08s)]
*  Yeah, personalize it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4163.92s)]
*  Why do we all have to experience this? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4164.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, exactly. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4167.12s)]
*  Painful noise sometimes. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4167.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you're driving through a city [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4169.320000000001s)]
*  and there's billboards and nothing is personalized. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4172.16s)]
*  It's like how TV used to be. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4174.24s)]
*  I mean, in the future, now all the stuff [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4176.16s)]
*  that you use on your phone, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4178.76s)]
*  it's like you get exactly what you're interested in [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4179.599999999999s)]
*  and it's just a much higher quality experience. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4182.04s)]
*  But there's all this physical stuff that just stuck [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4184.639999999999s)]
*  and is static. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4187.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, everything I think is gonna be able to... [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4190.4s)]
*  Sorry, not everything, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4194.92s)]
*  but I think it's an interesting thought experiment, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4196.04s)]
*  how much of the stuff that we physically have today [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4197.84s)]
*  that just doesn't actually need to exist in the future. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4200.36s)]
*  Do you think is social media bad? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4204.48s)]
*  I mean, I don't think so. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4210.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's not the right term. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4213.44s)]
*  At a certain point does... [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4217.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like how much... [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4220.759999999999s)]
*  There's been studies done where it's like doom scrolling [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4222.0s)]
*  and stuff like that can lead to depression, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4224.719999999999s)]
*  that sort of thing. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4226.4s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4229.0s)]
*  So look, we obviously study this stuff pretty carefully. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4231.32s)]
*  You guys do? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4234.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we study it, we work with academics to study it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4235.599999999999s)]
*  As you can imagine, there's a lot of media coverage [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4239.639999999999s)]
*  of this stuff that's very sensationalist, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4242.88s)]
*  that tries to have a skewed point of view. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4246.719999999999s)]
*  My understanding of the current state of the research [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4249.92s)]
*  is that there isn't a conclusive finding [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4252.5599999999995s)]
*  that this is negative for people's wellbeing. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4257.0s)]
*  So I think that that's... [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4259.64s)]
*  And in general, some of the stuff that ends up being [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4261.160000000001s)]
*  positive for people is building relationships. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4264.4800000000005s)]
*  So there's sort of the media part of social media [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4266.92s)]
*  and there's the social part of social media. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4269.6s)]
*  I think the interacting with people, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4271.160000000001s)]
*  to the extent that that's helping you build good relationships, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4275.0s)]
*  I mean, friendships and good relationships [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4279.68s)]
*  is one of the things that correlates the most strongly [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4281.360000000001s)]
*  with positive wellbeing and feeling good about your life [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4284.360000000001s)]
*  and all that. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4287.8s)]
*  The media stuff, I mean, I think that's more entertaining. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4288.72s)]
*  I think people want things that are fun. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4291.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, people wanna be entertained, for sure. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4295.12s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily correlate with good wellbeing [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4296.56s)]
*  or bad wellbeing, but I guess the way that I think [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4299.280000000001s)]
*  about this stuff is that our modern online environment [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4302.400000000001s)]
*  it's just an environment in which we live [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4313.52s)]
*  in a way that has pros and cons, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4317.04s)]
*  like whether you live in a city or a rural place, right? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4319.0s)]
*  It's like, okay, like some people may prefer living [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4322.2s)]
*  in a city, there's like things that are good about a city, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4324.96s)]
*  there are things that are bad about a city, okay? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4327.04s)]
*  Like the fact that we went from being primarily offline [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4329.32s)]
*  as a society to now like this kind of hybrid, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4332.32s)]
*  kind of physical and digital reality, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4336.04s)]
*  there's some things that are better about that, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4338.5199999999995s)]
*  some things that are maybe less good. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4340.0s)]
*  It's not that every single thing improves [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4342.6s)]
*  at each step along the way, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4344.36s)]
*  but I think overall, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4345.639999999999s)]
*  the overall effect is significant improvement [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4350.639999999999s)]
*  and I just don't see a way that people would wanna like [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4352.799999999999s)]
*  go back to not having services where they can get [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4356.48s)]
*  the content that they're interested in [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4360.12s)]
*  and where stuff is personalized to them [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4361.639999999999s)]
*  and where they can communicate with the people [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4363.2s)]
*  who they want and don't need to like be constrained [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4365.12s)]
*  just the people who are physically around them. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4367.08s)]
*  It's just, I mean, we're not going back to that [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4368.799999999999s)]
*  and if you look throughout history, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4372.16s)]
*  it's like when people like first built cities, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4374.08s)]
*  there were all these, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4377.92s)]
*  there's a lot of kind of nostalgia for the simpler life [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4380.28s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4383.84s)]
*  It's like, okay, yeah, and yeah, sure, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4384.68s)]
*  maybe cities aren't better in every single way [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4388.32s)]
*  and some people might prefer to kind of only go sometimes [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4390.32s)]
*  or whatever, but I just think it's like we're building [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4392.96s)]
*  more and more capabilities as a society [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4396.72s)]
*  and I think that that's sort of, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4398.64s)]
*  I just think about this stuff more as like an environment [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4399.96s)]
*  in which we live. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4402.04s)]
*  So then it's more like if, yeah, like sometimes I think like, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4403.48s)]
*  because I've been thinking a lot about this, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4406.48s)]
*  I think a lot of people have, it's like, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4407.679999999999s)]
*  well, we're moving into such a, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4409.32s)]
*  like technology is advancing so much faster, right? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4410.759999999999s)]
*  It's accelerating the advancement speed [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4413.36s)]
*  and then we're just humans and we're in this space now [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4416.28s)]
*  where there's like one generation to the next [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4420.12s)]
*  where one generation was completely grown up online [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4421.599999999999s)]
*  and one hasn't really. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4423.639999999999s)]
*  So I wonder, and I think the older generation [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4426.719999999999s)]
*  probably sees it as like, man, this is so negative, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4429.96s)]
*  everybody's stuck, but I wonder if the younger generation, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4431.96s)]
*  do they even know any different, right? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4434.32s)]
*  You know, like just, I start to wonder, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4435.96s)]
*  what is the value of being human? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4438.2s)]
*  Like, what is the, does that start to dissipate [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4440.76s)]
*  as we become more technologically advanced [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4444.0s)]
*  or does that alter? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4447.44s)]
*  Like, do you think about that sometimes? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4449.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I think it's gonna give people [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4451.72s)]
*  the freedom to focus more on the things that they want. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4454.12s)]
*  I think that if you look at the arc of history, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4456.88s)]
*  go back like, I mean, before, you know, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4459.32s)]
*  in ancient times, life was like pretty brutal, right? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4462.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, so then you go to like maybe right before [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4464.88s)]
*  the industrial revolution where. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4468.92s)]
*  They had team toilet paper at one time, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4470.719999999999s)]
*  they had like group toilet paper and it was like. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4472.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's not good, that's not good. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4474.48s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4477.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think, I mean, you don't wanna, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4477.84s)]
*  yeah, no, I think anyone who has nostalgia for the past [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4480.28s)]
*  really is not taking into account the disease [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4483.759999999999s)]
*  and the lack of hygiene that existed in the past. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4486.24s)]
*  So I think that there's, so anyway, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4488.48s)]
*  but pre-industrial revolution, I think some huge percent [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4490.5199999999995s)]
*  of the population was farmers because basically, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4497.08s)]
*  everyone needed to be focused on growing things [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4502.679999999999s)]
*  in order to have enough food. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4505.679999999999s)]
*  Then we basically got to the point where, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4507.16s)]
*  okay, now we can start to produce food [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4509.599999999999s)]
*  much more efficiently. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4512.28s)]
*  So that actually frees up a lot of people [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4513.959999999999s)]
*  to not have to be farmers. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4517.52s)]
*  Now maybe like 2% of people can be farmers [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4518.76s)]
*  and 98% of people can do other stuff. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4521.280000000001s)]
*  So now we, people start doing more kind of other creative [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4523.240000000001s)]
*  stuff and inventing new things. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4526.92s)]
*  And at each step along the way, kind of like being a farmer [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4528.320000000001s)]
*  is a really hard job, right? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4534.080000000001s)]
*  It's like you're working like a lot of hours. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4535.4400000000005s)]
*  And now as kind of people got more options, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4537.64s)]
*  they took other jobs. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4542.68s)]
*  But then we've also seen this mix where the percent [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4544.86s)]
*  of people's time that has gone towards leisure [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4548.78s)]
*  and entertainment has just steadily increased over time. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4550.82s)]
*  And I just think that that's gonna continue to be the case [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4554.94s)]
*  with technology. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4557.7s)]
*  We'll have more stuff that will make it so that [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4558.54s)]
*  the basic needs are taken care of, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4562.0199999999995s)]
*  which will free people up to do some combination [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4564.9s)]
*  of more creative jobs and not have to work as hard [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4567.7s)]
*  if they don't want to. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4572.18s)]
*  But I think some people are going to like working [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4573.54s)]
*  all the time like me, and you'll be able to do that too [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4576.22s)]
*  and get more done than you could have ever possibly done [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4580.5s)]
*  in the past, but that'll be sort of a choice. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4583.06s)]
*  Well, since you're kind of like a leader in innovation [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4586.06s)]
*  and technology in our world, you know? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4589.3s)]
*  Do you, how do you know that what your convictions are, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4592.34s)]
*  how do you gauge if what your convictions are [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4596.82s)]
*  are the best for everybody kind of like, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4599.66s)]
*  how do you kind of figure that out, you know? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4601.66s)]
*  It seems like such a challenge. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4603.7s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4605.86s)]
*  Does that make sense to the question or no? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4606.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think I get what you're asking. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4608.22s)]
*  I mean, look, at the end of the day, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4611.7s)]
*  there are still a lot of options of things [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4614.98s)]
*  that people can do. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4616.74s)]
*  Just because I build something doesn't mean [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4617.86s)]
*  that people are gonna use it. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4619.42s)]
*  Actually, a lot of the things that I build, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4620.46s)]
*  some of them work, some of them don't. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4623.26s)]
*  And like, I think part of the reason why the company [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4625.099999999999s)]
*  has been successful is because, you know, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4628.18s)]
*  maybe we have a slightly higher hit rate [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4630.14s)]
*  of things working than others. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4633.5s)]
*  But it's kind of like, I don't know, in baseball, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4635.38s)]
*  it's like most people don't get on base [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4637.700000000001s)]
*  most of the time, right? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4639.54s)]
*  So it's like, running one of these companies, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4641.22s)]
*  more of the stuff doesn't work than does. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4645.9800000000005s)]
*  And if we do something that doesn't work, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4648.42s)]
*  then in general, people aren't gonna use it. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4653.06s)]
*  And then the future doesn't go in that direction. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4655.58s)]
*  I see, so you're saying it's up to the user more. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4658.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I kind of think, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4660.46s)]
*  one way to look at the world is that [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4665.900000000001s)]
*  there's a version of history that says that [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4671.02s)]
*  individual people are very powerful [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4674.42s)]
*  and have a lot of kind of autonomy and ability [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4676.46s)]
*  to kind of go in the direction that they think is right. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4678.900000000001s)]
*  And then there's like all these other narratives [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4682.06s)]
*  where people try to kind of diminish people's [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4683.74s)]
*  autonomy and authority. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4687.58s)]
*  And I'm just like, I've always been a person [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4688.82s)]
*  who really kind of believes that people understand, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4691.94s)]
*  people are smarter than people think. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4696.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4698.38s)]
*  And I think in general, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4699.22s)]
*  are able to make good decisions for their lives. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4702.46s)]
*  And when they do things that like the media or whatever, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4705.06s)]
*  things don't make sense, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4707.74s)]
*  it's generally because the media [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4708.94s)]
*  doesn't understand their life, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4710.22s)]
*  not because the people are stupid. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4711.3s)]
*  Like if people are saying something that seems wrong, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4713.5s)]
*  it's not usually misinformation, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4715.26s)]
*  it's usually that you don't understand [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4718.18s)]
*  what's going on in that person's life. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4719.02s)]
*  And I just think that there's like a certain [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4720.3s)]
*  kind of paternalism in some of the mainstream narratives [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4723.900000000001s)]
*  and some of the media narratives. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4728.18s)]
*  Like a know-it-all-ism almost? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4730.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I- [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4731.860000000001s)]
*  There has been for sure for years. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4732.7s)]
*  I think it's starting to change more. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4733.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a little more receptive [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4735.7s)]
*  as maybe some of those cultural or media elite people [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4737.34s)]
*  are having a harder time predicting [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4742.18s)]
*  what's gonna happen in the world. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4743.46s)]
*  Maybe there's a little more humility of like, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4744.900000000001s)]
*  okay, maybe we don't understand all of this. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4746.54s)]
*  But to me, the best predicting thing has always been [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4747.94s)]
*  like, all right, if you build something, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4753.74s)]
*  do people actually think it's good? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4756.1s)]
*  Because like at some level, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4757.62s)]
*  it's like I just believe that people are actually very smart [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4759.54s)]
*  and understand their lives very well. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4761.74s)]
*  And if you're building something that is useful for them, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4763.0199999999995s)]
*  then they will use it. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4765.62s)]
*  And if you're using something, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4766.62s)]
*  if you're building something that is not useful for them, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4767.94s)]
*  then they have other options, they will do something else. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4770.22s)]
*  And so I don't know, it's always served me well [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4773.7s)]
*  to generally have faith in people [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4778.7s)]
*  and believe that people are smart [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4781.54s)]
*  and can make good decisions for themselves. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4784.34s)]
*  And whenever we try to like adopt some sort of like attitude [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4786.62s)]
*  of, oh, we must know better than them. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4790.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, we're the people building technology. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4792.62s)]
*  That's when you lose, right? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4795.18s)]
*  And if you have that attitude for long enough, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4796.54s)]
*  then you just like become a shitty company [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4799.06s)]
*  and you lose and you lose and you lose [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4801.66s)]
*  and then you're irrelevant. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4803.78s)]
*  So I tend to just think that at the end of the day, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4805.099999999999s)]
*  yeah, I mean, I think people are smarter [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4809.62s)]
*  than a lot of people think [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4811.78s)]
*  and I think ultimately drive the direction [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4812.86s)]
*  that society goes in. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4814.78s)]
*  So like people, a lot of times like there's guys [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4818.5s)]
*  who are like kind of, you know, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4822.26s)]
*  Elon Musk is probably like a socially awkward guy. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4823.98s)]
*  And I would say, I mean, I think that's, yeah. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4826.34s)]
*  We all are. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4830.14s)]
*  We all are, right? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4831.099999999999s)]
*  I think we all are. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4831.94s)]
*  And it's interesting that there's like probably people, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4833.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, have you ever felt socially awkward over your years? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4835.74s)]
*  No, I'm really smooth. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4838.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4840.94s)]
*  No, no, no, no, obviously. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4841.78s)]
*  Yes, yeah, I'm like the most awkward person. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4843.299999999999s)]
*  People have been calling me a robot online for 20 years. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4845.179999999999s)]
*  It does wonders for my confidence. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4849.379999999999s)]
*  No, your confidence cannot be impaled, I don't think. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4852.099999999999s)]
*  That's one thing you have [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4854.9s)]
*  that's probably a sheer North star inside of you. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4855.74s)]
*  It's gotta be. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4858.219999999999s)]
*  Well, I guess. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4859.0599999999995s)]
*  You might've become bulletproof. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4860.0599999999995s)]
*  I think there's times where, yeah, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4861.46s)]
*  you seem like a guy who probably like watched a video [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4862.54s)]
*  of how to be a guy on YouTube or something, you know? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4866.339999999999s)]
*  But I think we all go through, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4868.66s)]
*  we're all like awkward in different ways. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4871.54s)]
*  You know, you put you in certain environments [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4873.46s)]
*  and you're not at all. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4874.82s)]
*  But I think it's interesting that there's- [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4876.259999999999s)]
*  Haven't found those environments yet, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4877.94s)]
*  but maybe, you know, it's- [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4879.46s)]
*  Even being here today, bro, is nice of you. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4881.86s)]
*  It's nice of you to be here today. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4884.379999999999s)]
*  I think the podcasts are awesome [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4886.299999999999s)]
*  because you just like, you get to explore something. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4887.82s)]
*  Right, for sure. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4889.62s)]
*  Here's my question. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4890.78s)]
*  Sorry, Mark, I'm gonna interrupt you. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4891.62s)]
*  No, go for it. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4892.7s)]
*  But I'm not gonna get another chance to, so. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4893.54s)]
*  My question is, is it interesting that they have [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4896.0199999999995s)]
*  kind of people who have, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4898.5s)]
*  what probably self-described as socially awkward at times, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4899.98s)]
*  kind of creating technology that socially connects people? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4903.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the thing that, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4908.62s)]
*  do you ever find that kind of fascinating? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4909.46s)]
*  Because I've always had a belief that, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4911.94s)]
*  like sometimes socially awkward people [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4915.34s)]
*  are almost a mix between human and like machine, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4916.78s)]
*  like the future or something. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4921.3s)]
*  Does that make any sense to you? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4924.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's an interesting question. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4926.259999999999s)]
*  I just think that there are a bunch of factors here [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4929.78s)]
*  that you need to peel apart. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4933.7s)]
*  I think someone can be socially perceptive [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4937.94s)]
*  and understand kind of what is going on [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4942.139999999999s)]
*  in social dynamics and have a lot of empathy [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4945.78s)]
*  and care about other people [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4949.7s)]
*  while still being quite awkward in how they communicate. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4951.82s)]
*  And so I don't think you can build a great social. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4955.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to build too broad of a bridge. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4961.86s)]
*  No, well, I think it's a fair point, right? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4963.98s)]
*  I mean, it's like, all right, a lot of social media [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4967.0199999999995s)]
*  is like people creating great content [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4969.3s)]
*  and kind of communicating really well. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4973.219999999999s)]
*  And those are not my biggest strengths, right? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4976.98s)]
*  It's like, I don't think I'm the best communicator [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4979.0599999999995s)]
*  by a long shot. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4981.42s)]
*  I mean, I think I kind of got to where I am [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4982.34s)]
*  because I think I kind of understand what people like [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4984.219999999999s)]
*  and I have the ability to build it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4988.86s)]
*  But I don't think my strength is like, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4990.94s)]
*  oh, I can really like communicate about why [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4993.139999999999s)]
*  what I'm building is awesome. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4996.34s)]
*  I generally like to make it so that my work speaks for itself. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=4997.42s)]
*  And I try to explain it so I can kind of explain [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5002.06s)]
*  how I'm thinking about it. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5004.38s)]
*  But I don't think people primarily like using our stuff [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5005.5s)]
*  because they saw me talk about it and they're like, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5009.18s)]
*  oh yeah, this seems super exciting now. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5012.02s)]
*  But I think the ability to kind of communicate [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5015.22s)]
*  in a way that is not awkward is a different skill [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5018.780000000001s)]
*  than the ability to kind of understand and have empathy [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5022.900000000001s)]
*  for kind of people and social interactions. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5026.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's, you know, there's an interesting thing [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5030.3s)]
*  where I actually think sometimes a lot of the people [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5035.02s)]
*  who can communicate in the smoothest way [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5037.5s)]
*  sometimes have a lot less empathy [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5040.58s)]
*  and understanding of social dynamics [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5043.14s)]
*  than the kind of nerdy guy who may not be able [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5044.9800000000005s)]
*  to express himself quite as well, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5049.1s)]
*  but sort of understands a little bit better what's going on. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5051.06s)]
*  And I don't know, the world's complicated [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5055.7s)]
*  and there's like multiple dimensions to all this stuff [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5058.9s)]
*  and no one's good at all of them. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5061.299999999999s)]
*  So you just try to do the things that you're, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5062.94s)]
*  like hone the things that you're good at [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5065.78s)]
*  and try to put it to service to do as good of work [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5067.219999999999s)]
*  as you can. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5071.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're in this unique place [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5072.42s)]
*  where I believe it's like one or two generations [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5073.78s)]
*  think that one, something isn't social. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5075.9s)]
*  And then the younger generation thinks that it is social. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5078.339999999999s)]
*  And so I feel like in some senses, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5081.82s)]
*  we're at this crossroads kind of of like how we communicate [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5083.82s)]
*  as humans a little bit. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5087.299999999999s)]
*  And this advancement and sometimes those steps [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5089.58s)]
*  are kind of tricky to take. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5091.58s)]
*  This is my last question, cause I know you have to go. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5094.139999999999s)]
*  So I feel like Elon Musk has like a, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5096.82s)]
*  like he wants to get on Mars [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5098.78s)]
*  and he wants to like impregnate different planets [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5100.26s)]
*  or whatever, or whatever he's doing, dude. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5102.58s)]
*  He's just blasting his seat out into the different rockets, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5104.219999999999s)]
*  whatever, he's just out there, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5107.3s)]
*  he's like the Johnny Apple solar system. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5109.34s)]
*  But- God bless. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5112.219999999999s)]
*  But no, God bless 100%, dude. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5113.5s)]
*  And yeah, 100%. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5115.86s)]
*  And I'm just joking. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5119.0199999999995s)]
*  I think he probably would know that. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5120.54s)]
*  But I just think it's interesting. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5121.5s)]
*  Like you get what his ideas are. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5124.26s)]
*  He wants to like, we want to be on Mars [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5126.7s)]
*  and we want to send the rockets [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5128.66s)]
*  and we want to make everything solar powered and stuff. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5129.94s)]
*  And you're such an innovator and a leader. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5132.099999999999s)]
*  Like what do you feel like is your kind of, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5134.0599999999995s)]
*  it's not a goal, but kind of where do you, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5137.54s)]
*  what is the thing where you see us? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5140.099999999999s)]
*  Like where you're at a point where like, man, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5143.58s)]
*  this is what I'm really proud of. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5145.0199999999995s)]
*  And this is where I see us going [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5146.34s)]
*  because we're all on this bus together going somewhere [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5148.02s)]
*  and we don't exactly know where we're going [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5153.06s)]
*  because it's the future. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5154.38s)]
*  But you're kind of one of the guys driving the bus, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5155.860000000001s)]
*  or at least riding shotgun. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5159.820000000001s)]
*  So it's like, where are we going? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5161.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think different people just care [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5164.5s)]
*  about different parts of the future. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5166.22s)]
*  So the space thing, I think it's cool. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5170.900000000001s)]
*  I'm glad that people are working on it. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5172.46s)]
*  It's never really been my main thing. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5174.3s)]
*  For me, it's all, it's kind of been about the intersection [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5177.02s)]
*  of how do you build technology that helps people connect [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5182.26s)]
*  with each other and understand the world better [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5186.18s)]
*  and just taking different formats over time, right? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5188.660000000001s)]
*  So when we got started, people were mostly like, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5192.620000000001s)]
*  writing text, then we got smartphones [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5196.780000000001s)]
*  and we got cameras with the smartphones. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5199.580000000001s)]
*  We started taking a lot of photos and sharing that. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5202.900000000001s)]
*  And now most of what we do is video, right? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5205.78s)]
*  The mobile networks are good enough [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5208.46s)]
*  that you can like share great video. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5209.98s)]
*  It used to be, like 10 years ago, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5211.82s)]
*  you try watching a video, it's like buffering, buffering. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5214.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like, okay, this is terrible, but now it's good. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5216.0599999999995s)]
*  People always want to both kind of express their ideas [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5220.46s)]
*  and experience other people's ideas [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5226.34s)]
*  in whatever the richest format is that they can. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5229.099999999999s)]
*  So if that was gonna be text, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5231.38s)]
*  then that was the best that they had, great. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5232.98s)]
*  Photos, visual, great, a picture's worth a thousand words. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5235.14s)]
*  Video, better than photo for most things. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5238.660000000001s)]
*  But I don't think that's the end of the line, right? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5240.660000000001s)]
*  I just think we're gonna be here, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5242.58s)]
*  whether it's five years or 10 years. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5246.34s)]
*  And I think the ability to like fully capture moments [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5248.02s)]
*  to really be able to experience them, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5253.54s)]
*  I think that's sort of the hologram thing [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5255.1s)]
*  that we're talking about. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5256.660000000001s)]
*  I think that that's just gonna be like the next level [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5259.14s)]
*  of people being able to express ideas. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5261.7s)]
*  Like the next palette kind of? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5267.86s)]
*  Moments in their life, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5268.7s)]
*  Like the next like blank canvas? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5269.54s)]
*  So I think that's one thing. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5271.26s)]
*  And then there's the whole AI thing, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5272.179999999999s)]
*  which we haven't spent as much time on. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5273.3s)]
*  I know we didn't get into, sorry. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5274.58s)]
*  We should, we should. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5275.98s)]
*  Which that is really going to give people [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5278.46s)]
*  a lot of new tools to kind of, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5283.78s)]
*  both just get smarter at everything they do [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5287.78s)]
*  and if you look at the world like I do through this lens [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5289.7s)]
*  of how do we express ourselves [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5294.46s)]
*  and how do we kind of take in an understanding [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5296.0199999999995s)]
*  of what's going on, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5298.7s)]
*  AI is just gonna be super powerful for both of those. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5300.54s)]
*  It's, you can already see some of the basic stuff [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5303.86s)]
*  with like people creating images or editing images. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5306.82s)]
*  Oh, it's unbelievable. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5308.66s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy how fast it's happening too. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5309.5s)]
*  That's what I'm amazed at is just how fast it's happening. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5311.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5313.38s)]
*  But do you think, like, do you envision this like, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5314.22s)]
*  are you just like, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5317.34s)]
*  like what do you envision that will be on these like, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5319.1s)]
*  do you have like a, like kind of like a utopian idea? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5321.54s)]
*  Or do, like, I just wonder how do you see things? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5324.860000000001s)]
*  Cause you're the only, like, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5327.78s)]
*  you're probably one of the smartest people [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5329.74s)]
*  to ever use thought. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5331.26s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5334.14s)]
*  Well, that we, you know, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5335.42s)]
*  you're one of the most unique people to ever use thought [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5336.74s)]
*  that we have in our time. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5338.62s)]
*  So it's like, how do you, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5340.26s)]
*  what is it, what is it like out there? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5342.7s)]
*  I mean, I think that we're going to get general intelligence. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5345.62s)]
*  We're gonna have systems that are smarter than, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5350.74s)]
*  than any individual. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5353.74s)]
*  And I think it's mostly gonna be very empowering for people. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5355.219999999999s)]
*  First of all, look, I mean, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5357.86s)]
*  there are already systems that are smarter [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5359.219999999999s)]
*  than any one individual today, right? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5361.139999999999s)]
*  If you take like a company, right? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5362.78s)]
*  It's like, okay, you got like a thousand people [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5364.139999999999s)]
*  or 10,000 people who are all kind of like working towards, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5365.54s)]
*  you know, ostensibly working towards a goal together. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5368.82s)]
*  Like I, you know, if the intelligence [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5371.54s)]
*  of a 10,000 person company is not greater [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5374.26s)]
*  than the intelligence of a single person, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5377.26s)]
*  then like, what are we doing here? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5378.9s)]
*  Right, so there are already these systems in the world [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5379.86s)]
*  that have this sort of super intelligence [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5383.26s)]
*  that is far exceeds what any one person can do. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5386.14s)]
*  And I just think like, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5390.0199999999995s)]
*  instead of having relatively few people be able [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5392.3s)]
*  to kind of harness the power of like, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5394.7s)]
*  you have the ability of, you know, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5396.74s)]
*  you have a 10,000 person organization [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5398.98s)]
*  that can help you build the things that you think are good. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5400.74s)]
*  I just think in the future, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5404.74s)]
*  almost everyone is gonna have that. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5405.58s)]
*  And that's cool, what does that mean? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5406.78s)]
*  It means that more ideas are gonna get tried out. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5408.7s)]
*  So you might be up like leveling up [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5411.38s)]
*  in an overall idea of creativity in the universe with AI. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5412.94s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it's gonna be every field, right? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5416.58s)]
*  So like science will get more advanced, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5418.86s)]
*  like we'll get more productive, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5422.219999999999s)]
*  but like, I think a big part of the internet [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5423.82s)]
*  is stuff just gets more fun and funnier [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5425.98s)]
*  and like the memes get weirder [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5428.34s)]
*  and more specific and like that is advancement too. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5430.58s)]
*  It's almost like universal basic technology [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5434.0199999999995s)]
*  kind of in a way. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5436.14s)]
*  It's just the ability to kind of express these [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5437.0599999999995s)]
*  like very complicated ideas [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5440.66s)]
*  in like a very simple piece of media. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5442.86s)]
*  I think we're gonna get better and better at that. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5446.1s)]
*  And that advances our kind of understanding [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5447.74s)]
*  of ourselves as a society. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5449.9s)]
*  So yeah, I don't know. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5451.22s)]
*  I think we'll get super intelligence. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5453.98s)]
*  And I would guess that it will be a continuation [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5456.14s)]
*  of this trend that humanity has been on [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5459.82s)]
*  for a hundred plus years of basically getting more time [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5462.0199999999995s)]
*  to do creative things, less time having to do drudgery, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5466.42s)]
*  not having to spend as much time working if you don't want. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5470.0599999999995s)]
*  But if you want to dedicate your life towards that, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5472.82s)]
*  you're gonna have more powerful tools [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5475.82s)]
*  than you could ever have possibly imagined. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5477.42s)]
*  So it's not as much a conviction as much as it is [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5479.66s)]

*  That is an interesting question. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5518.18s)]
*  I think. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5519.74s)]
*  You have two minutes to answer the. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5521.7s)]

*  Live forever. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5524.46s)]
*  Gosh, I think at some point we will, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5526.9800000000005s)]
*  like a lot of. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5530.1s)]
*  Well, let me come at it this way. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5532.06s)]
*  Our outside of Metta, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5534.18s)]
*  the philanthropy that I do with Priscilla, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5538.66s)]
*  the Trans-Zuckerberg Initiative is primarily focused [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5541.3s)]
*  on curing diseases. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5543.58s)]
*  And the way we're doing that is not by focusing [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5545.22s)]
*  on any single disease. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5548.14s)]
*  It's by focused on kind of basic technology [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5548.9800000000005s)]
*  at the intersection of AI and biology [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5550.900000000001s)]
*  to accelerate the pace of science. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5553.14s)]
*  And we originally thought that kind of a hundred years [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5555.06s)]
*  from when we started was sort of around the timeframe [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5561.58s)]
*  to be able to cure and prevent [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5564.66s)]
*  and like deal with all diseases. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5566.62s)]
*  I know there's a chance that that happens sooner than, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5570.7s)]
*  because of all the work with AI. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5573.5s)]
*  I guess I'm more optimistic about that now. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5575.38s)]
*  With that means that like we are gonna live forever [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5578.9400000000005s)]
*  or we just have healthier lives for the period [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5581.74s)]
*  that we're supposed to be living. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5584.34s)]
*  And then at some point, like your human body is done. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5585.58s)]
*  I don't think we understand that yet enough. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5590.860000000001s)]
*  But a lot of curing diseases [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5593.34s)]
*  is not just about living forever. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5598.54s)]
*  It's about having better lives. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5600.3s)]
*  And it's like, while you're alive, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5601.74s)]
*  you don't wanna have to deal with shit. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5604.62s)]
*  It's like where you're just, you feel terrible [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5607.62s)]
*  because you're sick or you're injured. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5610.5s)]
*  Do you think it's possible? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5613.9800000000005s)]
*  Like you, because you have an understanding of science [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5614.82s)]
*  and being human that is way supersedes a lot of people's. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5617.18s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that we could figure that out? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5621.78s)]
*  Curing all diseases? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5626.66s)]
*  To be able to live, to keep life, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5627.86s)]
*  do you think it's possible we could figure out how to do it? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5630.58s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5632.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5634.46s)]
*  It's honestly, it's not an area that I've studied that much. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5635.3s)]
*  It's- [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5637.259999999999s)]
*  She didn't know, cause we don't know. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5638.099999999999s)]
*  We don't know what's going on, Mark. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5639.3s)]
*  And we just want you to tell us. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5640.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, no, I don't know. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5641.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5643.94s)]
*  Let's check back in in 10 years on that. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5644.78s)]
*  I think as the AI stuff makes more progress, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5646.66s)]
*  I think we'll kind of get a sense of the trajectory for that. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5650.58s)]
*  But I think it's just gonna unlock a lot of creativity [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5654.34s)]
*  and productivity and fun. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5656.54s)]
*  And like, I think people, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5658.38s)]
*  the technology industry misses fun a lot. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5660.94s)]
*  I think that that's like one observation [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5663.0599999999995s)]
*  that I've had building stuff out here, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5664.98s)]
*  is people are very focused on like, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5666.74s)]
*  all right, we're gonna make like a better word processor. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5669.9s)]
*  We're gonna like process information better, cool. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5672.299999999999s)]
*  But I know a lot of what people care about is just like, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5677.179999999999s)]
*  all right, I wanna like be entertained. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5680.5s)]
*  I want like, I want my life to be fun, right? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5682.54s)]
*  I want something that's funny [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5684.94s)]
*  that I can then go show to my friends [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5686.74s)]
*  and then we can talk about that. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5689.0199999999995s)]
*  And then just hang out and have a good time, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5690.9400000000005s)]
*  like showing each other funny things [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5692.820000000001s)]
*  and like talking about what the world is. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5694.22s)]
*  And I think AI is gonna make this stuff all great. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5696.5s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5699.34s)]
*  I mean, I do think this is a big focus for us. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5701.62s)]
*  And we're building this meta AI. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5705.5s)]
*  It's our, we call it personal AI. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5708.46s)]
*  I mean, our goal on this is not just to build something [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5711.14s)]
*  that's like, I mean, yeah, it's gonna be super smart, right? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5714.7s)]
*  It's like, yeah, we're trying to solve full general [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5717.58s)]
*  intelligence and super intelligence and all that. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5721.26s)]
*  But I think in order to build a product [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5722.14s)]
*  that people are gonna wanna use, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5724.3s)]
*  you're gonna wanna build something that's fun to use. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5727.38s)]
*  That means like, you're not just gonna wanna like type to it. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5728.900000000001s)]
*  You wanna like have a conversation, right? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5731.780000000001s)]
*  And it's not just about having it be like only able [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5733.46s)]
*  to answer hard questions. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5738.1s)]
*  It should like get to know you [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5739.3s)]
*  and like what you think is funny and like what you ate, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5740.34s)]
*  right? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5743.34s)]
*  So that way, you know, it can like, or you know, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5744.18s)]
*  what your hobbies are. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5745.3s)]
*  So that way it can kind of relate to you. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5746.38s)]
*  I think people don't know that AI can do that. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5749.1s)]
*  I think that we need, we're missing quickly, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5750.42s)]
*  I think in educating people how to, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5752.9800000000005s)]
*  what AI is and how to use it. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5756.1s)]
*  I think I noticed even in my own life, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5758.06s)]
*  and I spend a lot of time online involved in stuff, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5760.14s)]
*  but I think people are not understanding what's going on. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5762.900000000001s)]
*  So I don't know how we get people educated quickly [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5766.1s)]
*  so that they can, I think whoever can also serve people [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5768.1s)]
*  the best way to educate themselves [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5770.820000000001s)]
*  is gonna be able to best exert [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5772.62s)]
*  or be able to best coagulate people to their AI model [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5775.0199999999995s)]
*  or whatever. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5783.0199999999995s)]
*  You've never heard coagulate used that way? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5783.86s)]
*  Or yeah, or something like that. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5784.7s)]
*  But because that's the big thing. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5786.54s)]
*  A lot of people are like, we have the best AI, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5788.54s)]
*  but most people are like, what the hell is, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5789.86s)]
*  what are we doing? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5791.259999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5792.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfOkhrgxH0&t=5792.94s)]
