# You're Not Alone  This Past Weekend #133
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [September 24, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs)
*  Today's episode is brought to you by Grey Block Pizza. You know it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=0.0s)]
*  Today's episode is brought to you by Ridge Wallet. If you find something in your back pocket, that's probably your wallet. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4.8s)]
*  I mean, that's could be something else, but 90% chance, 95% chance it's your wallet or someone's wallet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=13.36s)]
*  If you picked up someone else's wallet on accident, but that's old school, man. Carrying a big lump in the back of your pants, bro. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=19.6s)]
*  What are you? What are you, dude? Some kind of camel? Get your life better. And by better, I mean get that Ridge Wallet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=27.52s)]
*  And the Ridge Wallet is a front pocket carry. And it's that little, you know, it's that front area bad boy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=36.24s)]
*  And it holds your credit cards. It's got that money clip. Get the one with the money clip. That's my favorite in the back. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=42.8s)]
*  And they also got knives. You can get a beautiful knife. Get that, you know, that nook nook, you know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm saying do your own dental work or somebody tries to steal your Ridge Wallet. That front pocket carry hit him with that nook nook. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=54.72s)]
*  And you can go to RidgeWallet.com slash Theo and use the code Theo for 10% off. That's RidgeWallet.com slash Theo. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=62.56s)]
*  Carry your stuff in the front. Stay out of the back of your own pants. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=73.6s)]
*  What's up, you coma roamers? What's up, you sleepy creepies? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  Wake up, man. Get your mind up. Get your brain up. Get your chest up. You know what I'm saying? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=84.16s)]
*  Pinch your nipples, dog. Bite your tongue. You know what I'm saying? Flex your holes, bro. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=90.96s)]
*  You got this. We got this. You know, I'm that nightmare teddy bear, baby. I'm that, I'm that Freddy Ruxpin. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=96.88s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=104.72s)]
*  She was hotter than the blacktop. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=106.72s)]
*  Broke down at a truck stop. She looked about as wild as the story she told. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=133.44s)]
*  Said she was a Christian saving souls in Savannah and the Lord was sending her to Alabama. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  She was in a hurry. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=148.4s)]
*  And that's a little Bishop Gunn right there with Alabama. And, and, and that, that, that music video [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=172.24s)]
*  is coming out in a few weeks. I'm going to be in that, dude. I got it. You know, I told you guys a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=197.12s)]
*  while back, I got to be in that music video with the Bishop Gunn and I play, you know, pretty much [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=200.24s)]
*  a young fellow, you know, a lightly aged gentleman, you know, you know, still kind of strong in the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  skin, but also kind of nervous in the spirit. And I am on the run from literally on the run from the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=216.56s)]
*  dark arts down in Alabama. So that was a beautiful time that I had with them, boy. That was just a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=224.64s)]
*  real just joyous occasion. Like somebody just sprinkled sugar all inside of my damn heart. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  What's up? Good to see you guys. This episode is always brought to you by Great Block Pizza. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to put that in and they're at 1811 Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=244.88s)]
*  And I just got back from Toronto in Toronto. I was at the Just For Laughs comedy festival [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=250.24s)]
*  and they say festival, but it seemed like a little bit of like a scam where they're just using [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=260.24s)]
*  comedians to sell tickets, honestly. And the shows are great. It's still great. It's great for the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=266.48s)]
*  fans that come out, you know, it's great for that curious crew that come out to see me and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=272.16s)]
*  to go see anybody. But I just felt like the J.F., the company didn't put on much of a festival. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=277.36s)]
*  I didn't think, you know, I mean, I saw a couple, you know, they had a homeless dude out there [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=282.88s)]
*  looking for his friend, you know, for three days. Every time I go outside, this dude asked me if I [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  seen his friend. And I don't know, you know, I don't know if these wild cats have been playing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=296.24s)]
*  hide and go seek since the 90s or what, but this, you know, he's like, hey, have you seen my friend? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=302.4s)]
*  You know, have you seen my friend? You know, he has kind of long hair, but it's also kind of short [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=309.28s)]
*  on the sides. And I'm like, who has long hair, but short on the sides. And then I'm thinking, oh, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=313.76s)]
*  fuck it. That's me. Maybe this man is looking for me. But anyway, so yeah, if that's the festival, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  some dude looking for his friend, then that was the festival. But the city itself, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=324.08s)]
*  I can't speak highly. Look, I love America. I'm happy to be American. I'm grateful to be American. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=330.88s)]
*  I don't exist if I'm not here. This is my place in time and my place, you know, on this earth. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=335.6s)]
*  This is the, you know, the cubicle of earth that I came into was through that, you know, that red, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=342.88s)]
*  white and, and blue pickle. You know, this is the, this is the pathway that I came into existence [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=348.16s)]
*  was through America. But, but Canada is a great place, man. I mean, and Toronto, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=355.2s)]
*  dude, it's so diverse. Let me tell you that, dude, you can, if you're racist, you couldn't even figure [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=362.96s)]
*  out who to hate. This is the most diverse place you ever seen, man. They got everything out there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=368.08s)]
*  They got, uh, one dude said he was jalapeno. I'm like, what is that? They got a dude. He was [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=374.88s)]
*  Polish and Pomeranian. You know, they got what Japanese Sri Lankan. Some dude said he's Sri [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=381.12s)]
*  Lankan. And I'm like mountain climbing, repelling. Some dude said he was, um, you know, I think he [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=389.52s)]
*  said he was a Serbian macchiato. Like, what is that? Dude, it's dive. I mean, yes, bro, it is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=399.44s)]
*  diverse. They got everything. And that's why I say beige power. The future is beige, baby. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=409.2s)]
*  The future is beige. So beige power, but yeah, people are just so friendly. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you know, Canada is the kind of place somebody will break into your house and install [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  an alarm. You're like, you'll be in your, like somebody would, would you have some dude hiding [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  in your closet with a knife in Canada? And he would come out and be like, Hey, Hey, um, I just, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=436.0s)]
*  yeah, I was, I just here was just sharpening your knives for you. Here's one. And you're like, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=443.2s)]
*  why? Like he thought he was going to stab you, but he's just, he'd been sharpening all your knives. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=449.44s)]
*  That's what he was doing. You know, and also maybe had, you know, uh, it's just, it's, uh, man, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=455.36s)]
*  it's just, people are just friendly. You could get shot and killed, bro. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=462.8s)]
*  Probably by a stray bullet from another country, maybe from North Korea, a stray bullet comes across [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=466.88s)]
*  the stratosphere hits you in Canada. You're dying in the street. And a Canadian would come up to you [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=471.76s)]
*  and be like, Hey, um, do you have a, do you still have a busy day ahead? And you'd be like, yeah, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  yeah, I have a lot. I had a lot of stuff to do later today, but I'm, I'm dying. And they were [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=485.12s)]
*  like, um, eh, well I'll die for you. You know, why don't you just go on about your day and I'll [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=491.84s)]
*  just lay here and die for you. If you don't mind. Like, uh, um, okay. Like that's Canada. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  Somebody will just die for you because they don't want just too nice. Dude. I literally, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  I was out last night. Um, what do I do? Thank you to everybody that came out, man. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=514.64s)]
*  Great, great, great, great people came out, you know, and not fans. I don't like to think of like [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=521.84s)]
*  fans. You know, I think of people that come out a little bit more like a curious crew, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=526.96s)]
*  because that's what I'm, when I think of myself as being like a fan of something, really, I'm just [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=535.84s)]
*  curious about it. You know, I've talked about that before. I'm just kind of curious. You know, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=540.08s)]
*  my curiosity has been enveloped, you know, or summoned by something. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=546.4s)]
*  And so, you know, we had a beautiful curious crew of characters that came out to the shows and, uh, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=554.48s)]
*  yeah, man, I got to be at this place called the winter garden and they got trees, they got foliage [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=562.72s)]
*  up in the ceiling. So they got, you know, Johnny Appleseed was just, I don't know if he was on some [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=567.68s)]
*  fucking MDMA or something, you know, and he just put sucks, just suction cups on his feet and just, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=575.2s)]
*  you know, went wall to wall, but they have, they have all kinds of trees and plants hanging [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=583.76s)]
*  from all the ceiling in there. So it's really, I mean, it was a beautiful theater [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=590.72s)]
*  and it was one of my first experiences in a theater. You know, I performed in South Africa [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=596.24s)]
*  a couple of years ago in a humongous theater there, but it had been a long time and that was [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=600.72s)]
*  part of a, uh, of a festival there down in Johannesburg, but this was, man, this was nice [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=606.4s)]
*  and it was just good people. Uh, what else, what else happened over there? Um, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=613.52s)]
*  oh, I hung out with Nick Swartzen and Nick Swartzen is like a little kind of, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=622.24s)]
*  uh, you know, he's like seven years old and also, you know, like 40 years old. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=628.32s)]
*  So he's like 47 years old. Like he has like, um, I, I'd never been around anybody that made me laugh [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=636.24s)]
*  more than that guy. He literally told me stories about him being set on fire. Um, he had some great [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=643.6s)]

*  and we got to talk to her about what it was like, what it's like being a sex worker and [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2180.0s)]
*  and just the issues that they face with new laws and regulations. And we had a couple of [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2186.24s)]
*  follow-up calls that came into that. Some people hit the hotline. You can always be a part of this [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2194.0s)]
*  podcast. The hotline is 985-664-9503. Let's get to a couple of those calls right now. Here we go. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2198.08s)]
*  Hey, Phil. This is Ray Ray from Albuquerque. Ray Ray down in Albuquerque. And I went to a nightclub [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2206.7999999999997s)]
*  in Albuquerque one time and there was one lady in the club dancing on a speaker by herself. I don't [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2215.04s)]
*  know if she worked there or if she just, you know, didn't like to dance at sea level. And a real [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2220.88s)]
*  song with a lot of bass came on and she fell off. She fell off that speaker there in Albuquerque. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2230.16s)]
*  Let's hear more. Home of the best UFC fighters in the world. Albuquerque is the best UFC and you [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2238.64s)]
*  got to be able to fight in Albuquerque because they got scorpions out there. They got desert animals. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2245.28s)]
*  They got people who, you know, they got deadbeat dads who are trying to just deadbeat others. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2249.6s)]
*  And it's a real, there's a lot going on out there. A lot of dream catchers, a lot of people selling [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2254.8s)]
*  bad art and good art. A lot of gold, people still looking for gold, a lot of dehydration. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2259.76s)]
*  So if you come across somebody that hasn't found gold in a long time and they're dehydrated, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2266.8s)]
*  they're going to want to fucking fight. And yes, that is some of the best UFC fighters out of there. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2272.16s)]
*  Let's hear more Ray Ray. I'm calling in regards to your last podcast with the sex worker and I [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2277.3599999999997s)]
*  thought it was a great interview you did. And I just wanted to kind of get my opinion. I personally [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2283.6s)]
*  think that you talked about the dark arts, the porn, drug addiction. I think that this, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2289.8399999999997s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, I think it's no different from any drug addiction, porn addiction. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2296.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it's all dark arts. Whether you want to say it's immoral from a biblical perspective, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2302.64s)]
*  from a societal perspective, I just don't think it's healthy. And I think you brought up a good [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2308.7999999999997s)]
*  question that if everybody's going to prostitutes, where does that lead the family unit, right? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2314.08s)]
*  Where's the trust? Where is that intimacy in the family if everybody's cheating on their wives and [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2321.2s)]
*  they're aspiring to do that because it's okay. As much as your sex worker wanted to legitimize [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2328.0s)]
*  her profession, I just don't think it's right. Some people can maybe go in there and get out, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2333.52s)]
*  but I think some people get trapped. And that's just my opinion. Thank you for this space for [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2339.7599999999998s)]
*  your callers. Thank you for listening to our calls. You're awesome. And I just want to say [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2345.2799999999997s)]
*  namaste and thank you. Thank you Ray Ray. I appreciate you calling. Those are good points. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2349.76s)]
*  Those are great points, man. It even makes me feel, it doesn't make me feel ashamed of, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2356.0s)]
*  it makes me feel, yes, if people are using sex workers, then they're not bringing that [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2362.88s)]
*  chi back into the household. If they're not bringing that chi back into their nest, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2374.0s)]
*  if they bust in that nudity down the street, down at Allison's Chi hut or whatever, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2379.6s)]
*  and they're feeding that other chi wah-wah down the street, then they're not keeping that [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2387.76s)]
*  lust and that energy in their own household. And you're right, it is a dark art. It is a dark art. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2394.24s)]
*  I think part of one of the reasons I wanted to interview her was to get the side of the story [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2406.8s)]
*  of what it's like for sex workers who are not sex traffickers, who are not sex traffic victims. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2411.36s)]
*  And just how some of the new laws and regulations have affected them. Now, I do think that long term, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2418.32s)]
*  some of those laws could be good because if it's not an option for women to advertise themselves, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2425.2000000000003s)]
*  then will some of those women get out of that industry and find something else to do? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2431.92s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if there's been enough studies that show that or I just don't know that [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2435.52s)]
*  information. But yeah, it's like, you know, I've had friends that have thought about sex workers [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2439.6800000000003s)]
*  and they'll talk to me about it. And then they haven't. And the reason they haven't is because [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2446.64s)]
*  they want to keep that energy in their household. There's something special about coming back to [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2459.92s)]
*  your bed and laying there with your spouse and knowing that you guys are a team, that you guys [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2464.64s)]
*  are in it together, that you guys are in it to win it. If it's good or if it's bad, you're playing [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2470.88s)]
*  the game together. And I'm not saying that that's not a great thing. I'm not saying that that's [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2477.44s)]
*  something that I believe in my heart, I would love to have in my own life. But if people are, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2482.32s)]
*  you know, if you're battling with the dark arts, then, you know, I guess it's good that there's an [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2489.76s)]
*  organized profession out there for you to deal with it. You know, there is an organized way to deal with it. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2498.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, now some people might deal with sex addiction, they need to go see about that and [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2508.88s)]
*  they need to get help. But I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2512.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't know, this is a great topic, man. And these are really good points. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2520.0800000000004s)]
*  And I appreciate you bringing them up. It definitely weakens the fan. It definitely does. I mean, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2524.0s)]
*  I don't think you can go back to your spouse or your loved one or your girlfriend and keep it 100% [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2528.48s)]
*  and know that that nest, that the egg, the overall egg of comfort and relationship that you guys are [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2535.92s)]
*  incubating together is going to be as warm if you are acting out. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2543.76s)]
*  You know, I guess I don't know. I mean, this is good. It makes me think about it, man. And I [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2557.36s)]
*  appreciate you calling and making me think. But it was also, it was good to have Allison in here [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2561.5200000000004s)]
*  and to hear what it's like from her perspective. I wonder how healthy her relationship is with [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2567.28s)]
*  power and stuff like that. You know, I had a lot of questions about that that I wish I would have [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2578.32s)]
*  asked at the time, but I didn't. But thank you so much for your call, man. All right, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2582.5600000000004s)]
*  let's go to another call about the Allison scenario as well. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2586.0s)]
*  I just wanted to say thank you. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2597.36s)]
*  Thank you for calling. You're welcome. You know, I just don't want to look down on somebody if they [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2618.8s)]
*  are a sex worker. You know, I don't think that there's, you know, it's a job. It's being done. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2624.0s)]
*  It's been done since the beginning of time. Different people's value systems are going to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2630.64s)]
*  be different. If you have a situation with your spouse or your, you know, wife or husband where [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2634.32s)]
*  that type of stuff is something that you guys are okay with each other engaging in or something, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2640.56s)]
*  then that can be one thing. You know, it's probably safer, I would guess, than [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2644.56s)]
*  going out and, you know, maybe it stops people that are rapers or people that are, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2651.52s)]
*  you know, lonely from devolving into, you know, really, really dark worlds, you know. I don't know. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2657.68s)]
*  I don't know. There's a lot there. I mean, it's a wild, I mean, these are women that are operating [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2664.7999999999997s)]
*  on the cusp of society, but heavily operating. And there's a ton, I mean, it's extremely popular [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2669.36s)]
*  in big cities. So it's something that's going on. It's definitely something that's going on, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2677.52s)]
*  and it's part of our livelihood. And I just think we're always in a time of transition. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2684.4s)]
*  And is sex something that people are using as much as, you know, is sex that connector that [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2692.56s)]
*  it always was between a couple? With everything being so sexualized now, I mean, you know, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2698.4s)]
*  you turn your phone and there's 20 ads that have had, you know, breasts and everything. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2705.44s)]
*  You know, before you've even seen your spouse in the morning, you've seen 75 different, you know, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2710.08s)]
*  scantily clad covered women via advertising or via Instagram or just, you know, on a television show [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2716.16s)]
*  or on the news. You know, it's just there's a lot of, there's a lot of sex out there. And it's [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2723.7599999999998s)]
*  almost like has sex jumped the shark a little bit? Is it as, as crucial for our connections these days? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2730.64s)]
*  Or is emotion what is more important? You know, with sex just seems kind of so rampant these days [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2740.7999999999997s)]
*  and almost, I don't think that it's, I'm not saying that it's valueless, but it just seems more, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2749.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, people are, it just seems to be so everywhere now that people are just almost [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2757.04s)]
*  just like fist bumping with their crotches. Whereas I felt like when I was, you know, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2760.16s)]
*  and maybe it's because I'm older that it was more like, okay, sex is the thing that will connect us [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2766.96s)]
*  for life and forever. And now it's just seems, I don't know, it just seems different, but also [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2773.2799999999997s)]
*  in Los Angeles, where, you know, every there's billboards everywhere and, and you know, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2780.48s)]
*  billboards everywhere. And, and I'm not living back in my hometown where, you know, a lot of [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2785.36s)]
*  people got married out of high school and that sort of thing. And, and there's more of a religious [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2790.08s)]
*  backbone in the community. And, and I can see, I don't know, it's a big, it's a big, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2795.76s)]
*  it's a big conversation. There's a lot going on. And if you have thoughts on that about, you know, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2802.0s)]
*  sex in today's society, and if we're over sexed or if we're, if we've lost the value and you know, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2807.2000000000003s)]
*  you can hit the hotline, nine eight five six six four nine five zero three. Let's take another call [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2813.28s)]
*  right here. Here we go. Hi Theo. This is Elaine from Nebraska. Hey Elaine from Nebraska. And you [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2821.0400000000004s)]
*  guys's football team is the worst. Sorry to tell you that. I'm sure you already knew and I shouldn't [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2829.6000000000004s)]
*  have said that. Actually it's kind of rude to me to say, but, but you have great people there. And [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2835.0400000000004s)]
*  I've had a beautiful time when I've been through your, your state. Onward Nebraska is a state. Yes. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2839.92s)]
*  Onward. I'm just calling because I was listening to your podcast about, you're talking about how [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2845.36s)]
*  some women feel pressured to be successful by climbing up the corporate ladder or something. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2852.16s)]
*  And for this reason, they don't want to start a family or have a baby. And I think that's super [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2857.36s)]
*  valid, but I just wanted to, I guess with my own personal experience has been the opposite where [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2862.4s)]
*  I feel pressure. Maybe it's where I'm from to have a baby, start a family and be that motherly figure [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2870.08s)]
*  when deep down inside, I don't feel like that person. I'm, I'm with all of my life and sometimes [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2876.64s)]
*  I just feel like I don't want to fix what isn't broken or, and this might be my own issue. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2883.6s)]
*  Sometimes I just don't want to even share my love with him, with somebody else, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2889.6s)]
*  a baby. So that could be something, but I want to get your thought on like, I just swing back and [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2894.16s)]
*  forth all the time between feeling guilty for not having that motherly inclination. And I, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2901.04s)]
*  and then other times I feel like, well, it's my right to live my life the way I want to. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2907.7599999999998s)]
*  And I really just want to have a simple life and do the things I enjoy. And if having a baby isn't [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2913.44s)]
*  one of those, if I should feel bad about it, just let me know what you think. Love the podcast to [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2918.08s)]
*  you. Oh, I appreciate you calling in. That's a, you know, that's a lot to share. And I know that [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2924.48s)]
*  probably, you know, took a little bit to share some of those thoughts and probably to verbalize [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2930.88s)]
*  some of that. You know, it's funny. I think there's these templates that are from the past. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2935.04s)]
*  You know, there's these templates like, Oh, you should get married. Oh, you should have a job. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2942.56s)]
*  Oh, you should go to college. And, and I'm not to make this about me. I feel a lot of times like, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2946.48s)]
*  like I've always felt like, man, should I be settling down? Should I be married? Or should I [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2955.04s)]
*  just, you know, be, you know, sometimes I do just want to be by myself. And sometimes I do just want [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2959.12s)]
*  to, you know, I don't, you know, I get, you know, I get scared of caring about somebody or I get [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2965.68s)]
*  tired of it and I don't want to have to think about somebody else, but I get, I guess I get [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2975.44s)]
*  selfish and I don't want to have to think about somebody else but myself. Um, you know, and I get, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2980.64s)]
*  you know, I get scared about if I have kids, am I going to fuck up my relationship and, and, and, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2987.68s)]
*  and, you know, and cheat on my spouse or be a bad dad or, you know, and I get scared of wanting to [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=2994.64s)]
*  take on those, even risk those challenges. And yeah, I can imagine. Yeah, I can imagine if you're in [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3001.2s)]
*  a place where some places it is more about family, which is a beautiful thing, you know, to have a [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3008.88s)]
*  family and see the kids and they're running around and they're fucking, you know, kicking each other [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3015.68s)]
*  and dude, I remember these two brothers, they used to, you know, they used to do this game. It was [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3020.32s)]
*  like, you know, it was called dirty rabbit because rabbits do this, you know, rabbits do those little [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3027.04s)]
*  poops kind of, and they would take a, they would each get a, um, uh, a tootsie roll, you know, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3033.36s)]
*  the minis do not them long daddies, bro. These are children and they, they would wrestle until they, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3042.48s)]
*  you know, hit the other one with the right in that new, you know, in that, in that little, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3048.16s)]
*  you know, in that little, that tight mouth in the back, that little boot, boot, that booty hole, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3053.52s)]
*  you know, and it first want to get that little tootsie roll up in the other one's booty. All [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3059.52s)]
*  wanted up, you know, there was a champion. Um, anyway, I don't know why I'm getting onto that. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3064.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's gotta be scary. You know, you remind, it's gotta be scary to like feel like, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3071.76s)]
*  oh, I'm just supposed to have a kid and I'm supposed to, are there other things I want to do? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3076.32s)]
*  You know, is it, is it an old design to just, you know, have children and, and pro, you know, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3080.48s)]
*  like our grandparents a lot in some areas, especially in the Midwest, like, you know, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3087.76s)]
*  you might have 10 kids two or three generations ago, cause only seven of them were going to live. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3091.6800000000003s)]
*  And so you needed people to, you know, take care of your crops and take care of your farm and, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3098.7200000000003s)]
*  and you needed kids as they got older to take care of the other kids because, you know, the, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3102.88s)]
*  the, you needed help around the house. It was, it was a different, it was a different animal [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3108.3199999999997s)]
*  and family was so much more, uh, I think it was families were stronger back then. I would assume [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3115.6s)]
*  I'm also romanticizing these types of things. You know, I'm Norman Rockwelling a bit here. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3123.12s)]
*  Um, but I can, I feel you when you say that, you know, I think sometimes, well, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3129.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, I could probably live a, a life that would be more fun for me. It would be more, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3135.44s)]
*  maybe would it be selfish to do that? Did I live my own life and never, you know, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3141.68s)]
*  settled down and have a family? You know, I think about, I would feel sad if I, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3146.08s)]
*  if I didn't give like my brother and my sister, like any, any extra nieces or nephews. I think [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3150.2400000000002s)]
*  about that. You know, I think about, you know, I would have the ability maybe to then have a kid [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3154.96s)]
*  and be able to love my kid more than I felt loved so that I'd be able to complete that thing inside [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3164.08s)]
*  of me. And I don't even think that from a selfish way, but you know, if I could have a son or a [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3170.4s)]
*  daughter and really love them, you know, and I could see and know that they felt loved and that [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3174.7200000000003s)]
*  they felt, you know, comfortable and happy and that they, you know, woke up in the morning and [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3181.2000000000003s)]
*  had somebody that, you know, was excited to love them and care about them all day. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3187.52s)]
*  And that they knew they never even questioned whether or not that I loved them. Unconditionally, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3192.16s)]
*  they just felt it in their, in their skin and in their veins and in their, even in their eyebrows [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3199.52s)]
*  all day, they felt their father's love that, you know, or their parents love that would that, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3204.3999999999996s)]
*  would that make me feel whole in the spaces where I feel like I didn't get that? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3214.08s)]
*  And I don't know if that's selfish to think of that about having kids that way. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3218.32s)]
*  And I'm thinking, obviously I'm thinking about my own situation here, but you made me think about [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3222.08s)]
*  my favorite movie, which is Bridges of Madison County. And I'll go toe to toe with any dude out [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3226.16s)]
*  there. You see some dudes out there saying they bad asses and you like Fight Club and shit like [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3231.6s)]
*  that. Well, how about the original Fight Club for your heart, baby? Fight Club for your emotional [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3237.68s)]
*  that's a Clint Eastwoods and what else is her name? Marilyn Street. And Marilyn Street is [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3243.68s)]
*  probably one of the top 70 or 80 actresses, you know, and man, it's amazing because she has, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3247.6s)]
*  she has a family and it's this regular life. And then this man comes through town and he's [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3255.04s)]
*  a photographer, you know, he's that Kodak, you know, he's that, you know, he's that, you know, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3258.96s)]

*  in his hair. He looks real swaggy. And she just has this one weekend with him where they ex, you [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3284.96s)]
*  know, they have an expedition. They just, they get involved in each other's lives. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3290.96s)]
*  And she's, it's just kind of like her one moment to try a different lifestyle. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3296.4s)]
*  And my problem for me, young lady, as you're making me think about this, I'm indecisive. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3302.56s)]
*  So I can't tell sometimes what is me thinking about something or what is me feeling a way that [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3307.28s)]
*  I really feel. And that gets extremely aggravating sometimes. But these are great, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3312.48s)]
*  you know, these are great questions and people can hit the hotline with some of these thoughts. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3321.12s)]
*  Nine eight five six six four nine five zero three. If you feel the, is it, you know, does she, she, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3324.48s)]
*  she sounds like, you know, she didn't even want to share this sometimes with her, with their spouse. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3330.48s)]
*  You know, it's yeah, wow. That's a, it's a, what a quandary, but what so amazing of you to think [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3335.84s)]
*  about it and to verbalize it. That's very brave. But I think we are in this time now where it's such [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3344.6400000000003s)]
*  a me time where, you know, where we're all, you know, where I think though that, that everyone is [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3350.7200000000003s)]
*  becoming so it's becoming so me and so automated. I think we're going to get back towards a family [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3362.08s)]
*  type of thing where family is extremely important because it is, it is the only place where a lot of [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3369.84s)]
*  us will get actual real connection. I'm starting to think that that could be some of the future. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3378.16s)]
*  But I appreciate you sharing. I don't know, you know, I don't really have a lot of time to [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3386.48s)]
*  share. I appreciate you sharing. I don't know, you know, I don't really have any suggestions [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3390.08s)]
*  except to don't feel hurried to make a choice. And if you're unsure about, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3393.92s)]
*  you know, if you're unsure, you know, talk to somebody that you know, really cares about you, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3400.96s)]
*  you know, and I care. I just don't know if I have the brains enough to be able to really help you [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3406.88s)]
*  think about this more. But I don't think that there's anything wrong if you don't ever have [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3412.4s)]
*  a child. I don't think that at all. You know, I don't think there's anything wrong if you want [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3418.48s)]
*  to go out and chase a dream and you want to be dude Amelia Earhart's the second, you know, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3423.36s)]
*  because Amelia, let's be honest, Amelia Earhart, that bitch crashed. Okay, she gets a lot of credit, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3430.8s)]
*  but where you at Amelia? You know what I'm saying? At least Amelia Bedelia, like she worked, you know, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3437.28s)]
*  she at least worked hard and got a couple of books out about, you know, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3444.08s)]
*  cleaning and like sexy outfits. But Earhart, you know, she gets a lot of credit, but she didn't [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3447.52s)]
*  really get it done. So you could really be the first Amelia Earhart. You could get out there in [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3455.44s)]
*  a jet, you know, in a little Cessna or something, and fucking take your chances. And if you land [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3459.84s)]

*  bad boys, you know, a couple little fucking water jockeys and get them out there. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3470.64s)]
*  But whatever you choose, it sounds like you're a very smart young lady and that you're emotionally [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3477.7599999999998s)]
*  aware. And then I bet you're going to make really great choices for yourself. And thanks for letting [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3482.08s)]

*  like that anymore. You know what I'm saying? I can help take care of my mother now. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3651.6800000000003s)]
*  And now I don't, I didn't offer to sit, you know, and I, and I told her, I said, if you need help, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3656.56s)]
*  I'm here. That's what I said. And so now my mother knows if she needs help that she can ask. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3660.8s)]
*  So then it puts her in a, it, you know, it lets her know a little bit that somebody is there. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3667.92s)]
*  She doesn't have to feel alone. Now in your situation, you have both your parents. I would [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3672.96s)]
*  go to your father, you know, maybe go to your father and say, Hey dad, you've done so much for [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3677.12s)]
*  me. I want to be able to help out some, you know, I don't want to tell mom because, you know, you're [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3683.68s)]
*  the man of the house. But as your son, you know, you've done so much for me that I would like to [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3690.8799999999997s)]
*  be able to contribute. Would it be okay with you if I contribute to you or, or something like that, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3699.04s)]
*  that way your father can still present it to the family if he wants to. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3709.36s)]
*  And it saves his face with your mother. Not that he needs that or whatever, but it just puts you in a, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3714.5600000000004s)]
*  it still keeps you in your space where you're requesting to help and you're requesting out of, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3720.1600000000003s)]
*  not out of obligation, but out of a desire, you know, out of desire because you learned it from [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3727.84s)]
*  your dad. You can even put it like that to him. Now, if your dad is the kind of guy you know, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3735.44s)]
*  is not going to allow that I respect it. Maybe you go through your mom and see if there's a way to [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3740.4s)]
*  do that. Unless you feel like if your dad found out, he would be very upset or you could even sit [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3745.84s)]
*  them both down. Cause you know, the real value, your parents, man, and I learned this from a caller. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3750.88s)]
*  This is a while back. A caller called in and said that the best thing you can do is, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3758.32s)]
*  uh, is just want to help. The fact that your parents know that you want to help, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3764.0s)]
*  that they raised a type of boy, Tim, that wants to help others and that wants to be a contributing son, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3769.84s)]
*  that's going to make them feel richer than anything you could give them. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3778.0s)]
*  You know, that's what they really want. They just want you to be happy. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3784.4s)]
*  That's what they want, I guess. And I've never been a parent, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3788.24s)]
*  but that's what they want. They really want you to be happy. And you could say maybe then, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3791.76s)]
*  well, one thing that would make me happy will be really being able to contribute to the household. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3796.32s)]
*  So those are maybe just some ideas are going about it, but I think it's sweet that you even care, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3802.8s)]
*  man. You know, a lot of young people, they just think, you know, they want to get an [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3806.7200000000003s)]
*  argument with their mom and then they want to leave. And I've been that person, you know, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3810.64s)]
*  and being angry at my mom for the way, but you know, I'll sit around when I had extra. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3816.16s)]
*  You know, and I wanted to hold a grudge against my mother or something like that. And maybe some of [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3821.36s)]
*  it was deserved. I don't know. You know, who knows different times in my life. But when I get to the [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3824.96s)]
*  end of my life and, you know, I look back, yeah, I just want to, you know, I guess you always want [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3830.7200000000003s)]
*  to have been able to help your parents some, but I don't know. Thank you for making me think about [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3837.12s)]
*  this, man. And, and thank you for caring about your parents, bro. I think it's really, really sweet. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3841.52s)]

*  on a group level. And I think it's great, man. When I was young, they had a dude, you know, they had [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3975.92s)]
*  they had this family, they had a trick or treating, you know, and they would put the stuff by their [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3983.2000000000003s)]
*  house and they had to walk across this huge field. It was about a half mile in the middle of the [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3988.2400000000002s)]
*  field. They had all these electric fences and you couldn't see them because it was dark. So you're [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=3993.52s)]

*  You know, it reminds me when I was young for Halloween, somebody tried to dress up like a [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4069.92s)]
*  deaf kid in our town. You know, and he wore a turtleneck and just, you know, I think that was [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4073.44s)]

*  language, but you know, he never pulled out a quarter, never pulled out a dove and people [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4108.08s)]
*  beat his ass because they thought he was doing bad magic. So if you got a deaf kid, you know, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4113.5199999999995s)]
*  buy him a dove, get him a 30 or $40 dove could save his life. But for Halloween, what am I going [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4119.28s)]

*  man. It's just been wild. And I've been having to stay humble and trying to humble myself and [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4190.48s)]
*  just make sure I know where I'm at in my own space. You know, just make sure I know what's going on [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4198.5599999999995s)]

*  You know, because then you got to think about your own situation. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4335.4400000000005s)]
*  It's nice not to let Casper know that he's not alone. You know, it's hard. I feel almost [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4340.08s)]
*  ashamed to even talk about this a little because, you know, because I still have my brother, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4345.36s)]
*  you know, my brother's alive. You know, my brother is, you know, my family struggled with addiction [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4350.88s)]
*  a lot. And but my brother's still alive. And I'm very sorry to you as well, caller, you know, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4356.96s)]
*  that you lost your brother. Wow, what a powerful statement to share that the memories right now [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4363.759999999999s)]
*  that are painful will be, you know, will be some of your most prized possessions at some point. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4371.36s)]
*  And you know what's so funny, man? You know, I was listening. You know, I'm sitting here. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4386.0s)]
*  This is the first time I heard this call. This is the first time our producer Nick put it in. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4389.36s)]
*  He told me the episode, you know, there's, you know, there's some, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4394.96s)]
*  you know, some real stuff in it. But when you said that your brother loves you, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4397.92s)]
*  man, that got me. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4407.52s)]
*  You know, and that's what just made there's something powerful in [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4413.4400000000005s)]
*  in being there for each other. There's something powerful in sharing our stories. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4419.12s)]
*  There's something powerful, not letting other people feel alone. And you called because you [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4423.36s)]
*  don't want Casper to feel alone, man. I think that's really, really beautiful. And I don't know [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4427.92s)]
*  your brother. I don't know Casper's brother either. But I bet he's really proud of you today, man. I [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4432.5599999999995s)]
*  bet he's proud of you always. You know, you care enough to call and say that sort of thing. That [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4441.36s)]
*  takes a man. That takes a man. And I will connect you guys whenever I talk with Casper. I'll [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4446.16s)]
*  connect you guys. It's very nice of you. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4455.2s)]
*  And I don't know what else to say. I think I don't think there is anything else to say on that. I [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4459.84s)]
*  think he said enough. You know, I'm gonna leave that where it is. You can always hit the hotline [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4463.599999999999s)]
*  985-664-9503. Let's go. Let's go to a call right here. We'll go to one more call. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4470.32s)]
*  And let's see what's going on. Onward. Hey, Phil. This is your boy, Kevin, up in Montana. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4484.48s)]
*  Hey, brother. Thank you for calling from Montana. Onward. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4490.639999999999s)]
*  Just want to let you know I'm a big fan. Going through some dark times right now. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4493.92s)]
*  Had a pretty bad problem with alcohol for the last many years. I'm 28 years old. 27. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4500.32s)]
*  I got a beautiful little three-year-old boy and I had a wonderful woman. But [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4508.88s)]
*  all my drinking and stupid decisions, I didn't put family first and pretty much severed the ties [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4514.16s)]
*  with a woman who once really adored me for who I was despite all my flaws. Trying to get sober, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4524.16s)]
*  straighten out my life, be that good dad that my little boy needs. And I just want to tell you, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4537.839999999999s)]
*  man, your podcast helps me get through the day every day at work. I just really appreciate [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4546.4800000000005s)]
*  all your insight and all your jokes, man. And yeah, I've been sober for five days now. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4557.68s)]
*  I guess five tomorrow. And I'm going to try to keep it going. And we're still living under [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4568.320000000001s)]
*  the same roof. We have a house together and it makes it hard when we're separated. This last [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4575.759999999999s)]
*  weekend I went on a 48-hour bender and I made some stupid decisions, man. And it just, that was it. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4580.48s)]
*  And it ruined, I think, any chance of us ever reconciling anything. And I don't know. I hope [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4588.0s)]
*  to hear from you, you know, suggestions, advice, whatever you got for me, man. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4595.679999999999s)]
*  Thanks for calling. Thank you for calling. Congratulations on the five days, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4605.44s)]
*  if you still have it. I don't know when this week this call came in. If you don't have it, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4611.44s)]
*  that's okay. You can start back over. The cool thing about sobriety and that sort of thing is [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4618.799999999999s)]
*  that it's always there for you. You could have two years, you could drink again, you could go back. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4625.36s)]
*  It's always there for you. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4630.64s)]
*  You know, one of the things that I don't believe in the world is that a leopard never changes its [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4636.0s)]
*  spots. I think that's one of the biggest misconceptions that there is. You know, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4642.080000000001s)]
*  I do believe that people can change. You know, I've seen it in my own life. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4648.320000000001s)]
*  You know, I grew up like I used to not care about, you know, I used to not have relationships and [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4655.52s)]
*  care about people because I didn't know how to and because I couldn't feel that others cared about [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4662.240000000001s)]
*  me. And that's changing in my life. And I feel it, man. And I see it happening and it's scary [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4667.92s)]
*  and it's amazing. And I never even imagined that that could occur. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4676.0s)]
*  You know, ironically, I feel like the calls that we got before with these men that lost their [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4681.92s)]
*  brothers, you know, like, you don't want to be that for, you know, you don't want your son calling in [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4686.88s)]
*  here, you know, 17 years from now, because we will be still on air, 17 years from now. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4697.52s)]
*  No, you know, you can do it, bro. I'll tell you, you can do it. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4708.320000000001s)]
*  You can do it, man. You can change. I love the fact you said that she loved you unconditionally, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4718.400000000001s)]
*  even despite your flaws and your faults. And that's not going to change. You know, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4724.4800000000005s)]
*  despite your flaws and your faults. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4731.92s)]
*  And that's not going to change. You can do it. It can get better. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4736.56s)]
*  I can't tell you if you are an alcoholic. I have no idea. I can't tell you if you really have a [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4744.4800000000005s)]
*  problem. I do not know. But I do know that that my life changed for the better [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4749.04s)]
*  and continues to do so the longer that I don't use drugs and alcohol. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4759.360000000001s)]
*  And it's obviously it's obvious just that you care, man. You know, you care about yourself. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4767.84s)]
*  You know, you know, you got somebody that loves you the hardest. Sometimes there's something wrong [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4775.04s)]
*  wrong with alcoholics where we can't feel people's love the right way. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4780.8s)]
*  We can't feel it. We can hear it and we can say, oh, I know you love me, but we can't feel it [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4791.84s)]
*  correctly. And so if we can't feel it correctly, we don't always behave like it exists. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4798.08s)]
*  And that is one of the problems. I remember I hear, yeah, people say, oh, I love you. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4805.36s)]
*  No, I care about you. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. You know, I care about you. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4810.72s)]
*  But I couldn't really feel it because there was something wrong inside of me. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4814.96s)]
*  And that continues to get better. That thing that was wrong continues to get better. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4821.44s)]
*  And I can feel people's love for me, bro. And there has been no greater [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4826.08s)]
*  greater. I mean, it's like Star Wars, bro. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4832.64s)]
*  You know, when I feel that, like, you know, when somebody tells me that they love me and I can [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4841.280000000001s)]
*  actually feel it. I mean, I didn't I didn't know that that's what that was. I didn't know what [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4846.320000000001s)]
*  that was at all. I didn't know how that worked. And, you know, through the program of getting help, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4857.2s)]
*  I'm able to feel that more now. And I still struggle, but I don't struggle as much as I did. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4867.2s)]
*  But you can do it, man. I promise you, you know, I'll check in with you this week and see what's [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4875.679999999999s)]
*  going on. You know, maybe if you're in an area where I know somebody, I could connect you with [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4880.16s)]
*  somebody or whatever. And if you don't want to answer my call and everything, that's OK, too. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4884.24s)]
*  You don't have to feel any obligation. I don't want you to feel any obligation. But [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4888.0s)]
*  but I do want you to be happy. You know, I do feel like you deserve to be happy. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4895.84s)]
*  And it seems like you want to be happy. And, you know, is the woman the right woman for you? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4905.36s)]
*  You don't know who knows, you know, there's a lot. I mean, a lot of that stuff that you can figure [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4910.32s)]
*  that out. But if you start to find some ways to take care of yourself, man, you're going to take [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4915.5199999999995s)]
*  care of everything else. You know, you got to take care of yourself. But I appreciate you calling, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4921.679999999999s)]
*  man. You know, sometimes I listen to the call now and I listen to the whole thing and, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4931.28s)]
*  you know, I don't even know what to say. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4937.04s)]
*  But it makes me think like, you know, I didn't know my dad very well, you know, because my dad [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4940.4s)]
*  was so old and I was such a just a little boy. You know, my dad was born in 1910 and I was just a [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4945.2s)]
*  little boy. And I think, you know, my dad struggled with alcohol. You know, he'd been abused a bit by [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4951.28s)]
*  some of the women in his life and not, you know, I think he might have had some issues. But, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4959.679999999999s)]
*  I think he might have had some issues. But, you know, sometimes I wonder if he would have called [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4965.68s)]
*  into a place and, you know, and said he wanted to be a better man for his kids, you know. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4970.400000000001s)]
*  And if I'd have known right now that he did that in his life, that would make me think of him a [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4976.64s)]
*  certain way. It made me think, oh, wow, he had a heart. You know, he was a caring man. You know, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4980.4800000000005s)]
*  he once called in and professed that he wanted to be a better man so he could care about me better. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4986.4800000000005s)]
*  And so you just did that. And that's pretty powerful, man. You know, so that's pretty powerful [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=4993.12s)]
*  that you are that kind of dad. You have that ability. I don't know if I'm making sense [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5003.52s)]
*  sometimes, but man, I don't even know what to say. You guys have kind of said a lot today. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5009.6s)]
*  You know, this one kind of went all over the place and I don't even [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5015.4400000000005s)]
*  let's take another call right here, man. Let's take another call right here. Here we go. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5017.92s)]
*  Yo, Phil. This is Nick. I'm from Philadelphia. What's up, Nick from Philly. And if you look at [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5026.96s)]
*  my hat right here, I got on that hood hat and they're not even one of our sponsors on this episode, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5032.64s)]
*  but I got that hood hat for instance, South Philly. And I got that hood hat on my hat. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5039.68s)]
*  But I got that hood hat for instance, South Philly. And you can go to hoodhat USA [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5044.96s)]
*  or follow them on Instagram. They got all these swaggy hats that are more based on your neighborhood [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5050.64s)]
*  than they are just like, you know, just instead of saying go Eagles or whatever. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5055.6s)]
*  Thanks for calling. Let's hear more. So I'm 23 years old and I just got open heart surgery. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5061.2s)]
*  Oh, dang. They cracked open in them a orts, huh? You got that open heart surgery. Damn, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5066.0s)]
*  what'd they find, bro? I bet there's a bat in there. Imagine if, imagine they crack you open [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5071.28s)]
*  and a bat flies out. Dude, that's Edgar Aorta Poe onward. So I'll be pretty immobile for the next, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5076.96s)]
*  you know, about seven, eight weeks. And what I used to do for a good time, you know, I loved [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5086.08s)]
*  going out to bars and grabbing drinks, but I don't think that's quite a good move yet. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5090.32s)]
*  So yeah, you can't say, I mean, you could tell a girl, look, you know, I want to give you my heart [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5094.88s)]
*  and you could actually crack that thing open and show her. Now that's a pickup line. Be like, oh, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5100.88s)]
*  yeah, you want another way to my heart? And she's like, oh, yeah. And you're like, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5108.16s)]

*  I think I would start doing some more reading. You know, people give, send me books a lot and [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5164.719999999999s)]

*  A good hobby for you. If you were in the hospital, you could flirt with the nurses bad boy. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5174.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? They got this thing on the internet. I think it's like, um, it makes it [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5178.48s)]

*  sheet down and they see that fricking, that Lincoln log, you know, looking around, they see that thing. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5223.76s)]
*  Oh, he might be dead, but you know, but his penis is still Abraham thinking about some [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5228.72s)]
*  Hwase, some real Hwase out there. But yeah, what is a good hobby? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5236.400000000001s)]
*  And I don't, you know, I don't really know, dude. I don't know. You got to, you know, I don't know, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5245.280000000001s)]
*  man. Honestly, I'm kind of overwhelmed with just some of the calls that came in today. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5251.92s)]
*  And I don't mean to not think about that, but think about your call, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5255.68s)]
*  but I'm just a little bit overwhelmed. Cause I don't know what a good hobby is. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5259.04s)]
*  You could probably go to the kids area in the hospital. If you're going to be in the hospital [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5267.68s)]
*  and draw pictures or something with them, what's a good hobby? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5272.08s)]
*  You can make a cool YouTube video about what your experience is like with getting a heart [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5280.48s)]
*  issue or like that, a heart surgery and put that on YouTube in case somebody else is scared about [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5285.84s)]
*  the experience. You can kind of let them know what it's like. You know, I think that kind of stuff [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5292.0s)]
*  does help people. A good hobby. I don't know, man, it's be good to yourself. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5296.8s)]
*  You know, just try, just try and find ways to stay humble, man. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5309.04s)]
*  You know, try to be true to yourself. Think about, you know, think about your life. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5316.08s)]
*  What do you want your life to be like? Do you want to have a family? Maybe one day. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5321.599999999999s)]
*  Do you not want to have a family? Maybe one day. Get in touch with the instincts. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5325.68s)]
*  You know, if you got a brother, call them and tell them that you love them. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5332.96s)]
*  You know, if you don't have a brother, but if you got a sister and she got some strong [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5337.599999999999s)]
*  sideburns or whatever, call her. Tell her, hey, if you were a man, I would love you like a brother. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5342.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, call your parents up and ask them if you could do something to help. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5351.679999999999s)]
*  Are they doing okay financially? Would it be okay if you helped some? If you can. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5356.719999999999s)]
*  And as I'm saying all these things, man, I'm not telling you to do them, but these are things that [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5363.28s)]
*  I'm thinking that I can even do in my own life. And these are things that I hear from these calls [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5366.56s)]
*  today. You know, I could talk to Alice and the sex worker and just make sure that she's okay with, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5372.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, why she's doing her job. You know, I didn't ask her if she's so angry at men that, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5379.52s)]
*  you know, she has to feel like it's some sort of a power thing. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5386.0s)]
*  You know, I could have asked her probably more if she ever feels lonely. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5390.8s)]
*  You know, I probably could have got into it on some deeper levels with her [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5396.64s)]
*  to see what was going on there. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5400.8s)]
*  Yeah, I can call my brother and tell him that I love him. You know, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5410.160000000001s)]
*  you know, I can, I can pray for my friends and family and, you know, other people that are out [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5419.92s)]
*  there that are struggling with addiction. You know, I can call my mom and just try and be [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5425.68s)]
*  loving and not try and be argumentative, even if I want to be somewhere inside of me. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5433.360000000001s)]
*  Because she's lived a long life and she's not a perfect person and neither am I. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5440.320000000001s)]
*  And when was maybe the last time I called up and didn't give her any grief about [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5447.68s)]
*  how she's spending her day or how she's spending her money or what her plans are. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5451.52s)]
*  But just let her know that I cared, you know, after if I could do something to help. I don't know. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5455.52s)]
*  Man, you know, I start these episodes, dude, and I don't know where we're at. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5463.120000000001s)]
*  And then I get to the end and I don't know. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5471.76s)]
*  And I. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5473.92s)]
*  I just feel, I just feel like I'm not alone. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5481.36s)]
*  Like in the beginning, I don't know where I'm at, but at the end, I don't know where we're at. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5488.16s)]
*  And man, that's a lot of work. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5496.56s)]
*  And man, that's a, it's, it sounds like we're still, it sounds like still lost. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5498.799999999999s)]
*  But before I was lost by myself and now I'm lost. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5504.4s)]
*  I'm lost as a group. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5509.5199999999995s)]
*  And that seems a lot more hopeful. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5513.2s)]
*  I got one more ad I got to do here. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5522.08s)]
*  You know what? I'm going to play this song and I'll do the ads after. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5524.8s)]
*  I feel like we can use this song right now. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5527.04s)]
*  This one's by Bishop Gunn as well. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5530.56s)]
*  I ain't seen home in about a hundred days. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5554.8s)]
*  I can almost hear mama pray for my restless soul. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5558.72s)]
*  And I ain't made a dollar I ain't spent, but where it's going ain't killed me yet. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5566.0s)]
*  I still get where I'm bound to go. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5571.92s)]
*  I'm making it, I'm making wrong feel right. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5574.56s)]
*  I'm making it and if hell's where I'm headed to, I'm making good time. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5588.400000000001s)]
*  And most all of my plans slip right through my hands and wind up next to me broken on the ground. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5604.56s)]
*  If this bottle was an hourglass, I'd say that I'm about an hour past the minute. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5623.120000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5629.4400000000005s)]
*  I should have put it down, but I'm making it. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5630.24s)]
*  I'm making wrong feel right. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5639.92s)]
*  I'm making it and if hell's where I'm headed to, I'm making good time. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5645.679999999999s)]
*  Making good times, man. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5655.84s)]
*  Making good times. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5659.68s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5663.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just, you know, I feel bad. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5668.08s)]
*  Like, you know, some of the people out there that are struggling, I wish I could help more. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5672.64s)]
*  But just know that people are thinking about you and that you are not alone. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5680.72s)]
*  And life is tough sometimes, but you are making it. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5684.4s)]
*  And that there is a reason that you are going through what you're going through. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5687.599999999999s)]
*  Wherever you are in your life is where you're supposed to be. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5694.48s)]
*  And it's part of your journey. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5700.0s)]
*  And I believe you know that that this all ends really, really well. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5703.5199999999995s)]
*  Even though it can be tough right now, it all ends really, really well. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5710.24s)]
*  And that could be that you see your loved ones on the other side, you know. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5717.04s)]
*  But if you got a chance and you can still see them here, man, then you see them here. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RQKinUJvhs&t=5729.5199999999995s)]
