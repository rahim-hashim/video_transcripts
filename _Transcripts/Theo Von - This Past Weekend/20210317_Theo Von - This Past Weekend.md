*  I've always been a bit more ability to ramble [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1681.7s)]
*  And be that dusk in the wind [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1686.82s)]

*  So I think there's probably some nerves when it comes into um [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1701.3s)]
*  When it comes into [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1708.74s)]

*  so [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1749.3s)]
*  Um, what else do we have man, uh, you know, let's get into a little bit of news, uh right here [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1751.94s)]
*  Uh bill burr upset people at the grammys they said [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1761.3799999999999s)]
*  He said [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1765.3000000000002s)]
*  And I saw what he said and he didn't he didn't really upset anyone [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1766.5s)]
*  He didn't really even say much really [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1771.7800000000002s)]
*  um [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1774.66s)]
*  And you know what I started to realize [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1777.22s)]
*  What's going on a lot in the news these days is a reverse, uh psychology [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1781.22s)]
*  Basically [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1788.64s)]
*  You know bill burr didn't really say anything [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1791.7s)]
*  But suddenly there's an uproar and then it becomes a thing but the uproar is just created because uh [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1795.3000000000002s)]
*  That way people go see the clip right we know that kind of stuff [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1803.3000000000002s)]
*  People go see the clip whether it happened or not [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1807.7s)]
*  But then I started to think like at some bigger stuff, you know, I started to think about um, the dr. Seuss thing [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1811.38s)]
*  And here's my theory on dr. Seuss [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1819.0600000000002s)]
*  So [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1821.06s)]
*  For one I started to think that [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1823.3799999999999s)]
*  I bet I bet someone had a lot of dr. Seuss books that the sales on them had probably slowed down [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1827.46s)]
*  Because I don't know if people are buying as dr. Seuss as much [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1835.54s)]
*  You ask kid these days if who dr. Seuss is they think it's an actual doctor. They think it's an indian guy [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1839.7s)]
*  Let's be honest [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1845.54s)]
*  So, um [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1848.1s)]
*  I think the big deal is somebody I bet probably had too many dr. Seuss books. They couldn't sell them company whatever [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1851.1399999999999s)]
*  So they said well, let's let's create this blurb. Let's create this hubbub [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1857.78s)]
*  Let's make it so that oh these [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1861.78s)]
*  These books are going to get discontinued. Let's influence whoever we can to get these books discontinued or banned or whatever [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1863.86s)]
*  So then suddenly everyone goes and buys the dr. Seuss books [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1873.7s)]
*  Everybody's [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1878.5800000000002s)]
*  Now everybody's catting the head it up everybody's hammed and greened [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1879.78s)]
*  You know and everybody's fucking hearing hortons in the distance, you know, it is what it is [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1883.6200000000001s)]
*  But now they've sold more books than ever [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1888.9s)]
*  Just because so people can be like why you know [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1891.8600000000001s)]
*  Is so the whole thing is just a trick really whoever is discontinuing the books they don't really care [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1896.42s)]
*  In the end, they're just trying to sell some books [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1904.42s)]
*  I think the same thing was true with the mr. Potato head. They said oh mr. Potato. They're just trying to sell fucking [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1908.98s)]
*  Plastic veggie apples, bro [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1915.6200000000001s)]
*  That's it [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1917.78s)]
*  No one re it's all a trick [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1919.0600000000002s)]
*  Once they have us clicking on whatever boom [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1923.0600000000002s)]
*  Then we've are then our time our attention [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1926.8200000000002s)]
*  You know once you give your attention to something that's it because that's your value is your attention [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1931.3000000000002s)]
*  Um [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1938.66s)]
*  So anyway, yeah bill burr didn't say anything [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1940.18s)]
*  And if you looked at the clip, he didn't say anything [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1943.46s)]
*  Oh some cis white male. I didn't give it seemed ridiculous the the category they haven't given him but it just [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1945.78s)]

*  He could be there wasn't a ton of opportunity for him [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1958.9s)]
*  To really emphasize his personality [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1962.26s)]
*  But you know [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIPtZaP63U&t=1966.3400000000001s)]
