*  He isn't the accused gunman what was described as the group's ringleader [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KK9-eKd1k&t=4382.400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, that's possible. But you if somebody sees that guy that was going to be a rap [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KK9-eKd1k&t=4507.5199999999995s)]
