*  Just 10. I mean we did we did probably about 13 minutes in there. Yeah [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=166.68s)]
*  We were in it. We had there's dual. I mean, I feel damn [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Fancy saying this there's two ice baths now [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=175.88s)]
*  Like what's even the purpose have you ever even had someone come over and do it with you before never this is the first time [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=180.84s)]
*  that was the closest thing I've ever been probably to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  Kind of queering around with somebody [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=192.32s)]
*  Don't know if that's good or just not I don't want to say that that was probably the most [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=196.72s)]
*  The bravest thing I've done with another man [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=201.56s)]
*  It's like 32 degrees out too, so it's not even warm when you get out dude, I just feel like it's got to recover for a minute [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=206.44s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like a bunch of snow just tried to fuck me [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=214.52s)]
*  That's what I kind of feel like the weird thing though is you feel like when you're in it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=217.88s)]
*  You feel good after the first two minutes you feel like I was gonna swim in there [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=221.52s)]
*  I was saying that oh [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=225.68s)]
*  Yeah, I like if a seal would have swam up over it like oh, hey, I [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=227.68s)]
*  Feel like it would have been very we say are separate [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=232.04s)]
*  the two ice baths, yeah [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=235.08s)]
*  There's nothing I don't think is there anything [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=240.44s)]
*  Is there anything more homeless homoerotic than two men in one ice bath together? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=244.84s)]
*  Dude do you think anyone okay? This is a weird question [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Do you think it's possible physically possible after ten minutes being the ice bath to get an erection? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=255.96s)]
*  In it you can't leave [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=262.32s)]
*  You can say anything that happened like any type of visual mental simulation you need [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=266.28s)]
*  Wow, that's a great that would be almost better. I feel like then Dana White slap fight [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=273.0s)]
*  I think you know watching that like it had an underwater cam [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=277.42s)]
*  pop [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=281.96s)]
*  And we're just the refs on the side [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=284.88s)]
*  But it would have to be a clear tank you know and also I think you'd have to get a certain like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=288.36s)]
*  It'd be so hard to get it all the way to the top. I [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=293.4s)]
*  Don't know sorry we were to send these ice baths. I got these blue cube ice baths [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=298.92s)]
*  They sent me one a while back, and then they sent another one [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=302.4s)]
*  And they're awesome. I've just never and now you can sit two men facing each other [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=305.96s)]
*  And this is the first time I've ever done anything like that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=311.88s)]
*  So thank you, dude. You're welcome. Thank you for having me. Yeah, thank you for having me I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=315.36s)]
*  And so we're yeah, it's just we're both really we just got out. I'll be trying to convince you do we've been hanging out [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=320.88s)]
*  I hope this podcast doesn't suck because we've been hanging out and talking for literally the last five those six days [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=325.84s)]
*  Yeah, Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday today's Tuesday. Oh [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=331.08s)]

*  But I've been trying to get you to get in the ice bath with me in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=342.48s)]
*  Florida where it makes sense [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=345.8s)]
*  Where it's not 32 degrees when you get out. That's true, man. We got out and it was oh, yeah [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=348.52s)]
*  It was like I just see I'm trying to think of what it does it definitely I was just talking about this with George [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=352.36s)]
*  Kittle it really heightened. It's like you don't want to do it. It changed my whole [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=357.32s)]
*  Moment though my whole energy's kind of changed now good or bad. I think good a little while ago [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=362.36s)]
*  I was feeling a little bit overwhelmed. I'd done a little bit of vaping [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=367.84s)]
*  You know, I was like shit was going south [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=371.92s)]
*  And now I feel a little different you're in your cabinet. Look you don't those cookies. Well, I yeah I was trying to get my [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=376.2s)]
*  Sugar is not very good right now. I think my blood sugar was either down or up [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=383.68s)]
*  Give it a cookie [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=390.12s)]

*  I guess I mean, there's only two things I ever say that things are [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=397.24s)]
*  I say sometimes I say they're insane. Oh, yeah, that's it. It was an insane trip [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=400.68s)]

*  We were like we're gonna see each other at hunting. Oh, that's true [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=408.88s)]
*  And then it got kicked down the road because I went to the hospital. Oh, yeah, and you lied about it [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=412.16s)]
*  I didn't lie [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=417.22s)]
*  I just you guys hit me with that stuff on the airplane where you guys surprised me you and not William Compton [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=418.32s)]

*  I feel like and there was a lot of like they were getting people hooked up to ventilators [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=433.56s)]
*  I was on a ventilator and you told me to pull the plug [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=437.26s)]

*  They're like you want a battery want a trach. I was like, I'll take the ventilator [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=466.44s)]

*  We see a bunch of turkey talking playing like they were playing like badminton on the side of the road [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1694.04s)]
*  So then it's like alright, let's go kill one of these bastards. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Someone threw me a peace sign [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1699.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they're not. Yeah. It was like they they seemed to it was like I don't know [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1705.12s)]
*  I felt like the hunt had kind of ended a little bit. Yeah, it had [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1710.0s)]
*  And then also the thing about turkeys is dude these turkeys are they're two years old [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1714.32s)]
*  Well, they're fully mature [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1719.52s)]
*  That's what he told me. I don't really know but he said two years old is fully matured turkey. He's ready to die [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1721.56s)]
*  That's what he said [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1727.32s)]
*  But Kenny by so he can serve his country he can buy a beer [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1729.96s)]
*  But I just felt that was the part for me was a little sick like if like what if it was a two-year-old kid out [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  There you're hiding in the distance right making sounds, you know, like oh [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1740.36s)]
*  Give me that back, you know [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1744.58s)]
*  No, it's nap time. You start making shit and he comes over and then you shoot him with a fucking gun [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1746.8999999999999s)]
*  That's the part for me that wasn't adding up man [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1755.98s)]
*  It was like you do all this trickery to get him to come over and then they're only two years deceptive [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1758.6999999999998s)]
*  It's a deceptive business. Yeah, and then you literally blow the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1764.3s)]
*  Yeah, blue blue birds brains out [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1769.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was good there was some sad parts to it [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1772.04s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1774.0800000000002s)]
*  Also, dude, I shot that rifle the whole time my only concern was not a rifle as a shotgun [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1774.3200000000002s)]
*  The only concern I had cuz I think that was the only time my life of ever shot a shotgun [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1779.3600000000001s)]
*  I never shot a shotgun. I can't think of one time that I've done it [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1783.0s)]
*  Hmm. And my only concern was I had shot other guns at like the range or whatever [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1786.88s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and I was thinking every time I got earplugs [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1790.6000000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is gonna be loud like don't we need earplugs and it was like no, no, no, you're good [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1793.76s)]
*  Did I shot that thing dude, it's not like a bomb with I was like [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1799.1799999999998s)]
*  For like three hours the next day we went back. I wouldn't even hold a gun [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1805.26s)]
*  So bad when you're gonna hold a gun like these guys are insane and I said to him like oh, yeah [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1810.6599999999999s)]
*  We I was like we can't really hear that good anymore [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1815.4599999999998s)]
*  I was like he probably can't hear me right now and he literally said he literally said what? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1818.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1822.42s)]
*  We're gonna get some gobbler's [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1825.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was loud that's how I described it was loud but we ate him so I think that makes it like oh [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1827.92s)]
*  They cooked it up immediately and now look though. I mean it was a great experience. It was awesome. It was like [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1833.48s)]
*  It was interesting. You know, I didn't know what it was gonna be like, you know, I mean you go out there you kind of set up I [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1840.52s)]
*  Think I've always want to fight something hand-to-hand [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1847.16s)]
*  So I think it would to me it seemed like if I got a blade on me or a sword even I would go out [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1851.1399999999999s)]
*  There and fight a turkey, but I think you know, I think the little bit of like let me hide behind this tree [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1857.3s)]
*  Yeah, and make a sound of another, you know, yeah young animal and we didn't say this but the sound is [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1863.9799999999998s)]
*  like [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1870.6599999999999s)]
*  So it's basically a horny bird. Yeah, like we're supposed to be a hen [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1871.78s)]
*  We're pretending to be a hen right trying to seduce a horny [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1875.3s)]
*  Turkey, right? That's like say you're at a rest area, right and you go in the there's some dude out there smoking against the wall [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1880.58s)]
*  Right. He's out there just smoking a cigarette and you go inside the men's restroom or the women's right and the window [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1886.26s)]
*  He's smoking right outside of a window that get where you can inside of the restroom now and you're like, oh [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1893.82s)]

*  Yeah, and at first he's thinking oh that's some bullshit [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1913.8s)]
*  Really keep puffing his fucking Winston out there [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1917.8s)]
*  Yeah, and then finally you're just like you just start yelling like oh come and just snack on these titty nipples [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1920.72s)]

*  And that was really interesting [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1951.52s)]
*  It was fun the most fun to me about the whole chip that was by far just the in-betweens of the hunting [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1955.04s)]
*  Yeah, like going back we went on a walk. It was fun [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1959.98s)]

*  We saw some deers [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1997.9799999999998s)]
*  We saw you saying you saw some things trying to act like deers. It seemed like everyone was trying to act for us [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=1999.82s)]
*  I was putting on a show for us. It was like DE and all then they were cooking good for us [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2004.36s)]
*  They put us up and even animals sometimes they seemed like they were trying to do a show for us [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2008.58s)]
*  Yeah, well deers always act like every time a deer stops it like acts like it's like auditioning like it's like on a photo shoot [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2012.4599999999998s)]
*  You know like every deer even if it's like 60 yards away [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2019.3s)]
*  it's just like [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2022.38s)]
*  You know, it's just kind of like stop and stare. It's almost like they're modeling or something, you know [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2024.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's they were supposed to have ostrich out there [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2030.5200000000002s)]
*  That was one of the big selling points for me is you guys can come out here and you know gun down on a couple [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2033.5s)]
*  stretch out here [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2039.0800000000002s)]
*  And I don't know if our ostrich like trans birds or something they're very I [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2043.48s)]

*  I think that was an email the original email is that there was a couple stretch out there we could [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2054.86s)]
*  Pop off on but I'm just glad you did get to shoot those little baby hogs or at least shoot at them [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2059.58s)]
*  Or I mean, I'm not glad that you chose to shoot at them, but that you just got to shoot a gun [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2064.26s)]
*  Yeah, shooting the gun was fun. I wish we'd have spent more time shooting even just back at the camp [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2067.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it did make me want to buy a gun [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2071.06s)]
*  My biggest takeaway from the whole thing was that I was like, I'm gonna go get a gun [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2073.06s)]
*  My biggest takeaway from the whole thing was like you kind of wonder how you're gonna feel if you're this is my first time turkey hunting [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2076.06s)]

*  I was like am I gonna feel horrible afterwards or is it gonna be like no big deal and [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2090.64s)]
*  to me [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2097.12s)]
*  It kind of was like because we ate it and it was like kind of like why we're out there [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2098.56s)]
*  Wasn't a big deal to me it was a big deal, but I wasn't like sad. Yeah, does that make sense? Yeah [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2103.46s)]

*  Yeah, well, I think nature alone if nature they kill each other. There's a food chain, right? It's like they're not nature, you know [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2117.5s)]
*  Animals don't wake up in the morning be like, oh, I'm not gonna kill another animal funny [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2126.1400000000003s)]

*  There seemed a lot more to learn that we didn't learn and also the other thing is I think probably a lot of the enjoyment [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2206.38s)]
*  People get it from it is [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2211.1s)]
*  Michael kind of did everything for us [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2212.86s)]
*  Like we just sat there which I'm glad he did cuz we would have not got any we were we didn't get any turkeys as it [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2215.1400000000003s)]
*  Was right with the best turkey guy like if we just did it we would have got nothing, but he did do all the hard work [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2221.06s)]
*  He was [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2227.2000000000003s)]
*  Doing all the shit. So yeah, we were just sitting there with the guns. Yeah, he wanted to make it [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2229.5s)]
*  He made it as easy on us as possible [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2234.32s)]
*  I think if you got to do a grenade or you got to do like a little like a land like a thing they step on [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2236.02s)]
*  The landmine and you lay it out there some of that I would have enjoyed a little as well [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2241.7s)]
*  I think or also, you know, I've always wanted to fight a pig just with a knife. That's always been one of my goals [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2245.98s)]
*  The dreams are yeah. Yeah. Oh to jump out of a chopper or something fucking get a pig like that [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2253.54s)]
*  That to me. I just just the turkeys don't have anyone hunting on their behalf [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2260.62s)]
*  You're out there and you know, no one's gonna kill you [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2265.02s)]
*  Right, it would be cool if the turkeys had a couple weapons to like say if there was a turkey say if PETA [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2267.74s)]
*  They're like hey instead of just bitching about animals over here with some poster board every now and then yeah [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2273.3799999999997s)]
*  We are going to go out in the morning on behalf of the animals and set a couple of landmines out [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2279.66s)]
*  Or you just know that every day no matter where you are across the world [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2285.3799999999997s)]
*  You're hunting every single day after their shift outside of Canadian goose in New York City [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2289.7s)]
*  They're gonna take all those protesters put them in a helicopter and drop them with machine guns at one of the one of the hunting [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2295.12s)]
*  Sites, you don't know if it's gonna be your hunting site [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2301.08s)]
*  But that day they could show up machine guns and murder your ass [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2302.8399999999997s)]
*  Just give you like some type of edge like some type of we were just sitting out there kind of I mean as you kind of [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2306.3199999999997s)]
*  Go through periods of being bored a little bit. Oh, and you can shoot anything else that's gonna run by that's another problem [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2311.64s)]
*  I feel like at a certain point if you like when we didn't see any turkeys that second day [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2316.66s)]
*  That's when we started popping off on this pig [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2320.88s)]
*  It's almost like anything else that shows up is gonna get gunned down yeah, so but it was uh [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2323.8s)]
*  Yeah, I just I I don't know I mean it was it was cool. You know I had a long week [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2332.32s)]

*  I've always white noise should just be like somebody just like helping their kid with homework. It's just like [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2435.2999999999997s)]
*  Things that white people do [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2441.22s)]
*  Making a bundt cake [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2445.22s)]
*  It's just an older couple listening to Willie Nelson on their front porch [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2450.54s)]
*  I saw a couple goblins [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2455.62s)]
*  My what else dude good to see you again man fun. Yeah, I haven't seen you since [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2463.62s)]
*  All week every day [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2469.02s)]
*  That's what I'm saying like damn dude. I hope we have some talk about I guess we [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2471.02s)]
*  Always something to talk about yeah, what was um? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2475.18s)]
*  Your seasons rat for a Sunday conversation. Yeah, yeah, we do like [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2479.5s)]
*  so it's [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2484.18s)]
*  Sunday conversations started as a [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2485.4199999999996s)]
*  Segment on our pro football show like Sunday conversations CBS countdown or whatever their NFL show is mm-hmm [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2488.54s)]
*  We just added it Sunday conversation glenny balls eats a ice cream sundae. That was just the idea a little segment for our show [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2493.54s)]
*  So it ran their football season so for the first three years. We've done. We've done three years now three seasons [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2499.02s)]
*  We just ran it during football [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2504.2599999999998s)]
*  But now I feel like it's kind of take on of its life of its own a little bit where I'm not sure people [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2505.94s)]
*  I don't think people like do the math in their heads [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2510.54s)]
*  It's like oh, this is a football show mainly because we never talked about football [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2512.46s)]
*  And the people who are honored pretty much never football players, so it's not a football show really [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2515.78s)]
*  And so now I'm just thinking about like is do we really have to do it like because it's like [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2520.78s)]
*  25 weeks or something football [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2526.6600000000003s)]
*  Like 25 weeks in a row of doing that show I travel to the guests to make it easier on booking [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2528.82s)]
*  so like you know it's if they have to come to [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2534.6600000000003s)]
*  Where I live in you know Delray or if I was in Nashville that to come to Nashville makes a lot harder [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2538.9s)]
*  So I travel to the guests which is a lot yeah [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2543.2999999999997s)]
*  And I wonder if the show would be better a better quality show if we can focus on the bookings get really good bookings [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2545.3399999999997s)]
*  And just go to them knock them out and spend really good time on the edits and stuff [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2552.94s)]
*  and [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2558.06s)]
*  Then not have to worry about being during only football season 25 weeks in a row. Please do a year-round [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2558.98s)]
*  Sorry whenever we get a good opportunity to do it right so not so maybe just like it could be every two weeks or every three weeks [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2563.86s)]
*  Just yeah, it could be back-to-back. I don't know maybe people will hate that [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2569.38s)]
*  I don't know there is something to being the same time every week people can wake up to it definitely some to it [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2572.34s)]
*  But I'm kind of playing with the idea of just starting to release them as we can get them. I [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2576.94s)]
*  Don't know maybe that could be a dumb idea. I haven't tried it yet. That's kind of the direction. I see it going [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2581.98s)]
*  It's is it nice though to have like that break. It's like you have the time where you don't have to go [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2586.14s)]
*  It's like you can know okay for this 12 weeks in my life. I'm gonna go and capture episodes [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2589.98s)]
*  I do like that about football season because I think about like this is my season [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2595.38s)]
*  But the problem is is like get out now, so now I'm like in offseason, but I have a job like it's not offseason [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2599.1s)]
*  Like I still have to be doing stuff. What are you doing? You mean like I like I should [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2606.34s)]
*  I've worked for a company like they should I should be doing stuff still like I can't just like all right tell foot next football [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2610.7400000000002s)]
*  You're like I'll be training until then like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2616.26s)]
*  Take off like a week or something like I should still be doing stuff [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2620.14s)]
*  Yeah, and so and I am we're doing some different stuff and me and you did something this morning, but um I [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2622.62s)]
*  Think that going away from just being intense about it [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2629.7400000000002s)]
*  I do like that though [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2633.54s)]
*  I think it's a good point like it is fun to focus in on something for a long time [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2634.26s)]
*  But just and also like things get played out too if you don't it's already been we've already been doing it a long time [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2637.42s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and so I'm not worried about it getting played out [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2644.1800000000003s)]
*  But I think to avoid it getting played out like really making them the episodes really good and really quality [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2647.2s)]
*  And I think that takes a little bit more like thought and time [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2652.9199999999996s)]
*  Then just like really every week just ramping them out ramping them out right, but you've had some I mean you've had amazing guests [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=2655.2s)]

*  Or at least on 30 30 songs. Yeah [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=3982.86s)]
*  Like to come out after dangerous had to follow that up with the pressure so high [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=3987.1800000000003s)]

*  Yeah, dude, it's funny because even when I heard dangerous I whenever [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4002.94s)]
*  I went with morgan in his band. They were playing it at somebody's one of his producers houses [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4006.54s)]
*  They were playing it the first time i'd heard it [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4011.66s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know some of you know [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4014.2999999999997s)]

*  It's funny how it just I don't it's hard. It takes you a little bit to get to know a song [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4021.42s)]
*  Do I ever tell you a story about luke combs [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4025.34s)]

*  Stopped me if I've said this before but so whenever I was uh [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4031.9s)]
*  Me and luke went to high school together, okay, he was an offensive lineman [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4037.5s)]
*  He was a senior when I was a freshman [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4041.0200000000004s)]
*  so I played on the varsity as a backup quarterback and then uh, he was a senior offensive lineman and so [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4042.2200000000003s)]
*  He didn't play much and I didn't play at all [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4049.1800000000003s)]
*  And so we would sit and talk to each other on the sideline just kind of you know [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4051.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I've seen you guys. I haven't seen y'all but i've seen guys just like y'all on tv a lot [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4055.58s)]
*  It's like the guys who know they're not going in so they're getting really comfortable [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4060.06s)]
*  And they're really digging in their heels and having a good conversation like that's what we were doing [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4063.4199999999996s)]
*  And so I always kind of was good friends with him as much as you could be from a freshman and a senior [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4067.58s)]
*  And so he goes on to abstate [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4072.3799999999997s)]
*  And uh my dad died when I was really little so when I turned 21, I was at carolina. I got a secure social security [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4074.3799999999997s)]

*  Immediately like I had to get rid of this money. And so I hit up luke [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4093.64s)]
*  I you know, I was like, what can I do this? I want to like invest it [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4099.1s)]
*  You know, you're 21, you're like half a brain you're trying to figure out a finance the rest of your life make some huge business [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4101.42s)]

*  He was just he wasn't doing anything besides he was singing like the local bar [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4118.14s)]
*  And he had a facebook. There's when facebook was big and he was posting his videos [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4122.94s)]
*  He had this incredible voice and I was like bro. You are gonna be [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4126.86s)]
*  You could be something like you could you could be something and hit him up. I told him that [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4130.7s)]
*  And chase rice went to our high school too and he was already doing it [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4136.06s)]
*  So we kind of had that glimpse of [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4138.54s)]
*  Kind of just had that glimpse of oh this could really happen for somebody [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4140.54s)]
*  Because chase had done it out of our out of our high school [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4143.660000000001s)]
*  And so I told luke and I was like man, I would love to I got this money. I'm trying to blow [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4146.14s)]
*  basically [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4151.740000000001s)]
*  and I was like I would really like to uh [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4153.26s)]
*  I would really like to like figure out a situation like to invest in you [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4156.860000000001s)]
*  In your career dude, because I think you're gonna be like you could do something. You just need some money [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4160.780000000001s)]
*  He's like for what? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4165.5s)]
*  But uh, so anyways, we're like trying to talk about it. We're like, how would it work? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4168.38s)]
*  And he's like, well, let me send you some songs [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4171.42s)]
*  I'm like working on and I have the email exchange still and uh, he sends me like three songs [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4172.780000000001s)]
*  And I I listen to him and I've got this like cocky 21 year old [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4179.18s)]
*  I'm not being cocky, but you know, you just think you know everything [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4182.54s)]
*  And i'm like, oh well, you know, I don't know [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4185.740000000001s)]
*  I sent him back some notes. I was like, I like this one, but maybe we could do this and [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4188.9400000000005s)]
*  Uh, he could do this [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4193.82s)]
*  I'm financing it bro. He does whatever I want him to do, dude [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4195.98s)]
*  uh [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4199.98s)]
*  Anyway, so he sent me these three songs [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4200.78s)]
*  Long story short nothing ever happens of it because it's impossible to just give someone money [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4203.5s)]
*  And like what am I gonna get like what if I got like 10 percent of his career earnings? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4208.38s)]

*  And I was telling that story to somebody like a couple years later. I was like i'm gonna go back and find those emails [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4216.62s)]
*  Bro, I went back and by the way my notes were like this song maybe not it this song's pretty good [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4221.339999999999s)]

*  and then uh [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4231.0199999999995s)]

*  Probably yeah for sure, you know for sure which is crazy, but [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4813.82s)]
*  Yeah, that just kind of is what it is. Would you do it? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4818.46s)]

*  so i'll say this my uh [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4836.7s)]
*  My grandma [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4840.219999999999s)]
*  She watched fox news every night like religiously and what happened to her she passed away. She passed away [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4841.5s)]

*  She didn't remember it at all. I don't think she even knew he was [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4880.62s)]
*  But like just the fact he did it's like, you know, they're people too, you know, it's like I know [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4884.700000000001s)]

*  If where if i'd want to get that deep of someone who's that on one side of it, you know, but well [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4932.139999999999s)]
*  That's what I do. That's what happened to dave he interviewed trump [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4937.66s)]
*  And then they started coming out from the sex tapes came out. That's when you saw all the sex tapes [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4940.86s)]
*  That's when the new york times writes article. That's when business insider writes the article [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4944.7s)]
*  That's whenever he starts like and it hurts his business and like [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4947.66s)]
*  You can say like dave. I really don't think he cares about people's opinions. Yeah, I don't think he cares [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4951.26s)]
*  But it hurts the business. It's not good [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4955.74s)]
*  And it hurts your relationships [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4958.78s)]
*  You know his he has a good girlfriend and he's got all this crazy stuff coming out. Yeah [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=4960.94s)]

*  Oh, it's nice you go outside. There's just there's a breeze [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6541.820000000001s)]

*  You know [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6553.4400000000005s)]

*  It doesn't have that it doesn't have that energy in the air where it just feels like everybody's there for a good time [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6557.9400000000005s)]

*  That's more at the beach and it feels a little bit healthier probably down there I think it's a lot healthier [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6567.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean people a lot of stuff here is like, you know, people are drinking. It's a big drinking culture golf [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6572.839999999999s)]
*  So I think you have a lot of those things [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6580.4s)]
*  There was a moment in my recruiting [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6583.16s)]
*  I was still early hadn't thought about my strategy [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6584.839999999999s)]
*  But I was trying to tell you that people in Nashville are drinking too much and you need to move to Florida [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6586.759999999999s)]
*  I [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6592.8s)]
*  Ran the math in my head. I was like, well that might not be my best pitch [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6595.66s)]
*  Yeah, do people are both [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6600.900000000001s)]

*  But it's got they've got sun tans would you say your response was like, uh, yeah, at least these guys gonna get cancer and die [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6608.1s)]
*  These guys are good. Not gonna live for I don't remember you says. Oh, yeah, there's less cancer in Nashville [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6615.18s)]

*  What else I'm trying to think of being so general about it? [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6626.68s)]
*  Oh, it's I can't wait to go back at least and have another experience of this a relaxing experience [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6628.88s)]

*  That UFC in Miami, this is what this is my best pitch so far that I thought of that makes sense in Nashville [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6641.6s)]
*  I live here for six months. So I know what it's like [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbx861O_7Do&t=6647.9800000000005s)]
