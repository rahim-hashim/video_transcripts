*  Yeah, so I guess so then take me through that so like [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=182.68s)]
*  There's like a lot of rumors out there. Yeah, you were a fisherman and you got you were doing fishing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  And so then what happened like you're [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=190.88s)]
*  Yeah, take me how you kind of started the first one [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know is it's college business planning classes [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=196.48s)]
*  so I grew up working in restaurants and bars and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=199.36s)]
*  High school college and I was like the kid that did the lemonade stand in the neighborhood always entrepreneurial, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=202.12s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanted to open my own restaurant. Okay, but of a college student, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=207.64s)]
*  So I'm like I want to do something that caters to the students [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=210.44s)]
*  I wanted to hire students because I knew the work environment they wanted I knew college kids work hard man [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=212.48s)]
*  They'll bust their ass, but they need some somebody that cares about them. Let's listen some fun music [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=217.8s)]
*  You know, what's what's serve our customers make them feel good about coming in and spending their money with us [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=221.6s)]
*  But what's have a good time we do it's house one of the first restaurants that actually had music going on the background things [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=226.52s)]
*  Like that, but that was my vision and so for business planning class [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=231.36s)]
*  I had a partner then when I started and we wrote it for his business planning class at LSU got the worst grade in the class [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=234.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=240.0s)]
*  In there baby, but in the hair, you know, but that's fuel, right? Yeah. No, that's exciting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=241.0s)]
*  Especially so so if you get that though [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=245.52s)]
*  Do you feel like like were you guys deterred was the business pursue with a partner at that point? Yep [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=247.28s)]
*  So you have a partner I did back then he sold out after the second one [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=252.56s)]
*  He just wasn't a he wasn't a fryer cook cashier didn't make him happy, you know, but I love working drive-thrus [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=255.58s)]
*  I like working fry lines, you know, it's what I love which is important [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=259.64s)]
*  I tell these students down like whatever you go into making sure it's something you like to do [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=262.76s)]
*  You're passionate about because if not, you won't be successful at it, right? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, love what you do works comes down to a grind [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=269.38s)]
*  But if you love it, then you're always happy doing it. It wasn't the right business for him [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=272.04s)]
*  We've stayed dear friends, but he sold out to the second one [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=275.88s)]
*  but we have those memories together because worst grade in business planning class and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=278.2s)]
*  It's just a B minus. He wasn't a hard grader. Yeah, but it was the worst grade in the class [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=282.84s)]
*  But for me man, it's like okay. Tell me tell me I can't do it. Let me show you I'm going to okay [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=287.36s)]
*  Okay. So there you are [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  so you guys get a little bit of neglect there from the grading system and then what happens like [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=293.28s)]
*  So then where do you go from there? Yeah, so I thought you know, we needed money to do a spot, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  So took that business plan look I thought businessmen, you know needed to look the parts who bought a cheap suit, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=303.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah bought a briefcase from like office Depot the one with a little uh brass locks on it [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=310.08s)]
*  You know, I can look official right I go in like I like a little some of the locks you did never even open [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=315.32s)]
*  Dude, I had one once it never you couldn't even get in it. There was so cheap, right? Yeah [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=320.24s)]
*  I had it on the zero zero zero or crank it up bring it the business plan talk to him about this chicken finger dream [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=324.6s)]
*  I had right banks were nice enough, but every one of them were like hey, man [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=330.92s)]
*  You know, you might want to work in the industry for ten years [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=334.32s)]
*  You might want to do this that any other work you're not in a position for us to lend you money [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=336.84s)]
*  Once again, no no no makes you want to do it that much more [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=339.64s)]
*  But had you had any experience in that line of work at all? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=343.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I've always worked in restaurants and did it and knew it like I knew how much my aprons would cost [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=346.04s)]
*  You know what? I mean like I knew it so well [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=351.52s)]
*  But people had a problem back then of just a chicken finger only concept right because quick service [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=353.12s)]
*  What happened the business plan they said you didn't do your research because like McDonald's is adding all this variety and all these different things [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  You're doing the opposite you want to do just one thing these chicken finger meals [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=364.52s)]
*  It's not where your industry's going but I knew doing one thing and do it better than anybody else would always pay off [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=367.88s)]
*  Okay [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=372.68s)]
*  And was there that option out there at the time because I remember growing up they had Popeyes and that's turned more into like a place [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=373.2s)]
*  Where people fight I feel like these days it's more like a boxing. It's almost like a mini UFC over there sometimes but um [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=379.04s)]
*  Was there anything that was serving just that chicken finger? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=385.88s)]
*  Yeah, Guthrie's they had started Guthrie's chicken fingers to start it off in Auburn years years before and they did [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=388.96s)]
*  University of Georgia they did Florida State and so the model was out there just wasn't in Louisiana, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=395.55999999999995s)]
*  And so it's hard for them to see that vision and for me [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=400.84s)]
*  I just knew college kids like good food and if you can do that chicken finger meal [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=403.52s)]
*  Like I said, and our busy biggest business was the late-night business to start off with and it went into the days [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=407.76s)]
*  So I stayed I stayed true to it. I knew I could do it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=413.16s)]
*  This to me was like this is my dream, right? So I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shut down. I'm not gonna stop [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=415.92s)]
*  I'm never gonna give up [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=420.48s)]
*  So I got a job through a friend of a friend working as a bowler maker and refineries right to do turn-around shift work to raise money [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=421.36s)]
*  Okay, so boiler maker. What is it? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=427.52s)]
*  Well, you say like when they when a refinery needs one section to be fixed right put into equipment replace old stuff [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=429.52s)]
*  They'll get a group of bowler makers to go in and do all that grunt work [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=436.88s)]
*  Okay, but they pay you big money because you work long hours during the week and they want that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=439.72s)]
*  Section that refinery come back as soon as possible because it will be production going everything welding cutting trays out putting in new equipment [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=444.16s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty much everything and you have to learn it on the fly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=451.68s)]
*  But it's like they want that thing open as soon as possible to get that oil production going so you can make a ton [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=454.2s)]
*  Of money if you're willing to work hard. Okay, so you got down there [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=458.36s)]
*  So you're working to or finally so how long after you guys have this business plan that you're able to put it together and kind [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=460.68s)]
*  Full of two years because after my refinery stent I needed more money and I met a guy named wild bill total art [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=466.64s)]
*  No kidding. Everybody had nicknames. Mine was Hollywood longer story. Oh, do we had a guy? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=472.0s)]
*  I remember we start work used to work at this summer camp and they had a guy who would come down [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=476.36s)]
*  And I shouldn't even work in there man [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=480.16s)]
*  I was dating a girl and she got fired and then I was like they were like, oh you can work here, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=482.24s)]
*  And so then they had a guy would come and take pictures of all the kids swimming and stuff every day and his name was [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=486.2s)]
*  Wild Bill, right? So finally wild bill. Well one day I'm like, hey, are we ever gonna see those pictures from wild bill? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=491.9s)]
*  And the line like they're like who's wild bill and like the photographer like we don't have a photographer [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=497.34s)]
*  I'm wild bill and the photographer taking pictures of kids swimming, which was a little not not ideal [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=503.78s)]
*  So wild bills can be interesting. It can be this guy was a wild ass and he he earned his nickname [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  But he said look, you don't you don't mind working hard and you're trying to raise money for this chicken finger dream [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=514.22s)]
*  These Buller makers were incredibly encouraging to me man [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=519.18s)]
*  Like man, you're gonna open your restaurant while bills in the summers commercial fishing in Alaska [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=521.14s)]
*  So were you running around and saying like chicken fingers chicken fingers? I mean you were just chirping about it [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=525.38s)]
*  Yes, man, like that you think my passion right? I was on chicken finger dream, dude, you know [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=529.02s)]
*  So it's like everywhere and everything and so people weren't just just encouraging but they're more like hey you got a degree [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=532.42s)]
*  You know, you should do this. You should do that. Maybe later in life you come back [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=538.3s)]
*  But you've been like I'm like no this is what I want to do those Buller makers were the most encouraging people [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  I'd seen a lot of really all of them like man you go for your dreams [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, they saw me working hard next to him every day. They're like, yeah here for your chicken fingers and uh [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=548.66s)]
*  Anyway, and so while Bill said look you can you can cut it go work [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=553.02s)]
*  Go up to knack neck Alaska and get a job in Bristol Bay [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=556.42s)]
*  Gilnetting for sockeye if you want to make some real money go up there and I did caught a float plane to King Salmon [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=560.06s)]
*  My sister gave me her freaking flyer mouse flying to Anchorage [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=565.14s)]
*  Got hit King Salmon hitchhiked up to knack neck went in tent city [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=568.06s)]
*  Took a month to get on a boat talking to captain into it spent that month that summer commercial fishing in Alaska is crazy [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=571.94s)]
*  What uh, so what was that time like up there like are the what? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=577.74s)]
*  Are you working with like a lot of Inuit? Are you working with like a lot of just local? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=580.98s)]
*  People like that are kind of hiding out because it's almost like the like the the icy Key West [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=585.7800000000001s)]
*  I feel like Alaska is almost that strange kind of like place where people can go to kind of get like really get away [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=590.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a mix so in you it's an in units hold the permits right the original boats [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=596.46s)]
*  So you have the Inuit population but a lot of fishermen from? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=600.82s)]
*  Washington, you know Oregon things like that and they go up to spend the summer to make money and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=604.2600000000001s)]
*  They're highly motivated because you can make a ton of money [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=608.46s)]
*  Most of these people just work that summer [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=610.86s)]
*  But then it was interesting because when I got on the boat I realized how motivated they are right [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=612.34s)]
*  So there's like you can go out and during the peak of the season Sam salmon are born in a stream [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=616.34s)]
*  Right they swim out to the ocean [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=620.9000000000001s)]
*  There's beautiful silverfish all of them have a cycle between four and like seven years [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=622.98s)]
*  Okay, they know to come back to the original river up the same river they spawn and they die and it's like it's crazy [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=627.5s)]
*  Yeah, so when they're coming into the summer man, it's droves of fish. And so it's like a boomerang almost [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=633.38s)]
*  Yeah, man, boom and boom and so then we were fishing with sockeye salmon [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=638.58s)]
*  The Japanese were buying like 95% of it paying top dollar [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=642.5400000000001s)]
*  And you can't keep going out into the ocean intercept these fish, right? You have a Loran line you couldn't cross [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=645.5400000000001s)]
*  So if you set your net on that line in front of another net, you just made like ten times more money, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=650.94s)]
*  So but is there a lot of jockeying for position out total jockeying man you picked it you nailed it man [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=656.42s)]
*  So it's like you will play chicken with other boats because you want that better set for your net and these captains are motivated [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=661.5799999999999s)]
*  Man, we ram boats boats ram dust. My partner went out with me then his boat ram his captain ram another boat and sunk it out [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=667.14s)]
*  There man, it's so crazy stuff man [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=673.86s)]
*  People were dying out there all this stuff because you're working 20-hour days during the peak right and it's not just four hours of sleep [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=675.78s)]
*  It's like an hour here and there go take a nap [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=681.86s)]
*  You're working so hard so people get tired and then they they get lazy they get not careful and they get thrown out with the nets [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=683.78s)]
*  Or whatever is going on [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=690.38s)]
*  So imagine a kid on a chicken finger dream the back of this 36 foot boat [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=691.3s)]
*  National Geographic is going to film the madness [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=696.22s)]
*  Medical helicopters are taking people out you're hearing so-and-so boat just had a death and all this and you're filling up the boat with fish [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=698.88s)]
*  Waves are crashing over the side. You're scared. You're gonna you're gonna you're gonna crash [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=705.0s)]
*  You're gonna you're gonna you're gonna get hit or you're gonna sink when I was out there for that chicken finger dream [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=708.26s)]
*  Dang it's almost like that's almost like the UFC out there. It sounds like the ultimate fishing champion championship or something like [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=713.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I can't even imagine people jockeying and the the the hours that you're on those boats [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=720.7s)]
*  Like what's that kind of time like the hours that you're on those you just stay out and so like, you know times money [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=725.1s)]
*  So if you have to go into the dock, you know, I mean you're missing money [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=730.4200000000001s)]
*  So they have tinder boats that you drop your fish off to so you just live out there [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=733.34s)]
*  You're staying on the boat [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=736.26s)]
*  Oh, so you're out there now the and then the little boats come by and you guys fill and you guys will just fill them [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=736.98s)]
*  Up with fish fill them up fish. Yeah, you take the tender boat [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=740.78s)]
*  Take your nets off boom put it back in and you go right back at it [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=742.9s)]
*  Now was there any drug use or anything like that on the boats? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=745.3399999999999s)]
*  Cuz I could imagine some people would be adderall up or something during it, you know back then [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=747.9399999999999s)]
*  You know adderall hadn't hit its hit its stride, you know [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=751.8199999999999s)]
*  So you just you just work and your body just gets conditioned to it man [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=754.52s)]
*  You become so hard like when I came back [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=758.18s)]
*  It was hard to get back in this society a little bit because you're just like you have to just constantly work [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=760.8199999999999s)]
*  Then it gets cold and it gets that you get beat up and they're like I came back [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=765.4599999999999s)]
*  Like man, I don't know. I don't know if I fit in just that a couple weeks later. I got soft again, you know [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=769.16s)]
*  Yeah, but uh, are you really hope again? Yeah, exactly now, so that's interesting [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=774.42s)]
*  So what do you think about like because that takes a certain type of person, you know to go and do [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=779.0s)]
*  that type of work that type of grueling environment where it's almost like a [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=784.8s)]
*  testament of your will in addition to [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=789.2s)]
*  You having to be employed at the same time [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=792.4s)]
*  Doing a job but you're also have to have this internal kind of thing going on where you were gonna hold the line you are [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  Going to keep going [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=801.28s)]
*  do you think that that was something that was always with you even as a child like [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=803.04s)]
*  were you always just kind of like a [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=807.12s)]
*  Not a sucker for punishment, but were you always somebody that wanted to be like in the fire or when you look back on your youth? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=810.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you see moments where? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=816.92s)]
*  You kind of understand your behaviors then and you still see them in yourself now [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know a lot of it and so I use sports as example, right? And so just playing something like football, right? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, what's on the football team? I was I mean look I went to 2a private school [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=831.64s)]
*  So I'm like like we're gonna have plays not like everybody plays [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=834.9s)]
*  So it's not like I'm saying I'm some great athlete, right? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=837.64s)]
*  But like I wanted to be the leader on the team, right? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=839.76s)]
*  Like I wanted to be leader so I could have played receiver or running back or whatever [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=841.64s)]
*  But I want to be quarterback because I want to man the offensive to a football also played on the defensive side [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  Went to defensive end but I wanted to be in charge and then I knew I could pull the most out of everybody, right? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=849.0s)]
*  So the best thing about playing to a private ball is everybody plays you can get the most out of them [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=853.88s)]
*  So I knew how to motivate them versus chewing their ass. It was like in their face was we're gonna do this man [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=858.04s)]
*  We're gonna do good [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=863.16s)]
*  And I think those leadership things and that hard work because I left everything on the field also want to do well [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=863.76s)]
*  School, you know and things like that [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=869.68s)]
*  So that determination was always there and really paid off later in a big way when I wanted to start this dream, right? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=871.32s)]
*  You know, right cuz yeah, I guess now that's something you notice in some people some people are just good motivators [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=877.4s)]
*  You know, you feel like that's probably one of your strongest suits [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=882.16s)]
*  Yeah, because look man, you know when I went and worked in high school college and restaurants [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=884.28s)]
*  It was more of a you're doing wrong [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=888.38s)]
*  Yell at you, you know and it's negative reinforcement doesn't work in my business [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=890.04s)]
*  If you go through a raisin canes, you're gonna see a bunch of happy smiling people [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=893.9s)]
*  But they're gonna crank out your food as quick as they can good quality [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=896.48s)]
*  But it comes from positive motivational management look like I go through my kitchens go see my crews all over the country, right? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=899.76s)]
*  But I go through the kitchen. Hey, that's nice toast right and you think tell the college kid [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=905.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just grilling toast big deal. They're like, hey, thanks. Hey, thanks for the hard work y'all appreciate it hearing good things [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=909.0799999999999s)]

*  You know [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=998.84s)]
*  I have so many of them and here's the thing when it's so hard to start something [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=999.52s)]
*  You build a culture of appreciation like every restaurant matters to me every crew member matters to me every box that goes out to [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1003.84s)]
*  Every customer matters to me. And so when you have this appreciation all these moments [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1010.5s)]
*  So like going through there and seeing a crew working hard. I'm like, hey go get them some cookies [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1015.52s)]

*  And so if I added different things, right? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1471.3799999999999s)]
*  Added spicy have added these one. I wouldn't be as quick in the drive-thru, right because the choices go down [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1474.7s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to cook it cook to order like if you come through our line [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1479.78s)]
*  We have a cook-to-order system that literally goes through [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1483.02s)]
*  I have that whole fry line set up to deliver that quality meal right with the best quality you can get [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1485.7s)]
*  But if I added all these different things bone-in chicken takes different times [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1490.02s)]
*  I'd have whole times my quality would go down my speed would go down and it wouldn't be our concept our concept is quality food [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1493.22s)]
*  Spurred with fast food speed and convenience and adding different things and losing focus would lose why we're special [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1498.8600000000001s)]
*  So when you even say the choices so you're even talking to the minutia of the fact that somebody then at a drive-thru [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1504.7s)]
*  Is having to make choices absolutely that's gonna take more time. That's gonna take more time, right? Wow. It's interesting [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1510.98s)]
*  I've never thought of the time it takes not only on the time on my side of the counter as [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1515.84s)]
*  The as the as the company but the time it takes the other like managing the time [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1520.74s)]
*  I'm gonna turn showing up without even real without them even really realizing it [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1526.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1530.06s)]
*  I mean we're over 60% drive-thru people want to come through and they want to get it quick [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1530.26s)]
*  Right people know their order of canes box no salt extra toast extra sauce boom sweet tea [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1533.26s)]
*  You're out the door or you're out through the drive-thru and so we want to keep that time to a meal [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1537.66s)]
*  So even like not distracting things, you know that are going on like so even we have like right now [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1542.3s)]
*  I did this restaurant recovery show [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1547.62s)]
*  But I got you know a picture of me and snoop helping this one restaurant out [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1548.58s)]
*  Even that makes people stop for a little bit and go do to do maybe ask a question in the window [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1551.58s)]
*  Then we're like, hey, we need to rethink this right? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1555.4199999999998s)]
*  I want them getting through because I got 20 cars behind them. Yeah, you know Wow [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1556.98s)]
*  Well, it's interesting man. Was there now was there ever a moment along the way where somebody's like hey, man [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1562.26s)]
*  You know you guys need to do [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1567.82s)]
*  Always always huh always the the experts are always like hey [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1571.3s)]
*  You know you guys really need to add a chicken finger salad [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1575.7s)]
*  You know the health trends on the da da da this that and the other and when I was younger [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1578.9s)]
*  I listened a little more because I'm like wait, maybe these people are smarter than me [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1583.18s)]
*  Maybe they know more than me and look I'm always constantly learning [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1586.5800000000002s)]
*  But my gut said no because if I do that chicken finger salad chicken your salad the quality is not not really there [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1589.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's not the same thing [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1596.0s)]
*  It won't be craveable and they want to come back and so that people told me but they scared me they were like [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1597.4s)]
*  Well, you're gonna get the the cancel vote like if one person the car one of the parents wants it [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1601.6s)]
*  They're not gonna go to you to go somewhere else [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1606.72s)]
*  I'm like no if the kids are gonna push them because they want that quality right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1608.04s)]
*  Staying true to what I've done [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1612.32s)]
*  Not listening. I know who I am and I'm not trying to be all things to all people [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  Right because if you try to be that man, you're gonna you're gonna not not be anything to anybody, right? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1618.9199999999998s)]
*  I want that craveable [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1623.0s)]
*  Customer calm canyacs and it's paid off brother. Yeah, and I thought it was cocaine at first man [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1625.0s)]
*  Cuz I remember the first time I ever did cocaine was down at LSU man, and I took a run [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1630.6000000000001s)]
*  I thought it was performance enhancing drug [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1634.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't know that it was like a drug for just night use or whatever [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1636.16s)]
*  So I went on a run down by blue bonnet down by the railroad tracks, dude [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1639.76s)]
*  I probably ran almost 15 miles [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1642.88s)]
*  Still sometimes I can still feel my heart feels like it has a horse hoof in it man [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1649.04s)]

*  Before people knew that I was funny [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1711.2s)]
*  I mean some people knew but before like a decent amount of people knew [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1713.44s)]
*  Man, cuz then you had the element of surprise, you know [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1717.28s)]
*  There was something nice about the element of surprise like you're gonna be surprised, you know [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1720.56s)]
*  You can be surprised when I lay this joke, but yeah things right, right? Yeah, and now people probably expect it, right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1726.16s)]
*  Yeah, now people expect it which is great. But it it's you can now you can't really replicate that when you when they didn't know [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1730.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1738.3600000000001s)]
*  Was there moments like I noticed in my business as my career goes on that there are times where it's like my [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1740.52s)]
*  career feels like it's on a little bit of like a [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1746.08s)]
*  You know on Elon Musk's golf cart [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1749.24s)]
*  Like it's really cruising, you know [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1751.6s)]
*  And then there's times where it kind of has lulls and I start to wonder what's going on [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1753.08s)]
*  Take me through some of the trajectory of how you guys got out of one location [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1756.76s)]
*  And then what started to happen and if there were times where you felt like [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1760.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay, this is where we've kind of maximized [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1765.04s)]
*  Did you get into the business like how do you have to transition from being at the place to then getting more into the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1767.3600000000001s)]
*  Business side of it. Mm-hmm, and just take me through some of that, please. Well, except for me, you know [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1773.28s)]
*  The whole business been one series of getting [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1778.16s)]
*  Getting your butt kicked and learning from those mistakes, right? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1780.72s)]
*  So if you're not making mistakes, you're not getting out in the middle of things, right? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1783.28s)]
*  And so, you know one restaurant to the second was the hardest growth we ever had, you know [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1786.0s)]
*  I grew too quick, you know, it was other side of campus the one only drive. You probably went to that one, too [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1790.32s)]
*  I probably fried your chicken late night there and but but I wasn't I didn't have my staff ready [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1794.96s)]
*  I didn't have all my people together and like I saw some people wouldn't show up on shifts [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1799.44s)]
*  I'm like, wait, I can't be at both restaurants and then getting butt kicked there. That's actually when my [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1802.72s)]
*  Partner ended up saying hey, man, this isn't for me. Wow, so it really rattled the cage a little well [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1807.1200000000001s)]
*  He just was like look, you're okay coming back all the time and like when I have time when you have time off [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1811.6000000000001s)]
*  You'll go work on schedules and doing learning better training programs. He's like, I want to go back read the Wall Street Journal [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1815.92s)]
*  He was just more that business side of it, you know [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1820.4s)]
*  But like going from there then I grew five restaurants in five months [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1822.56s)]
*  These old drive-throughs double drive-throughs and baton Rouge were going once again. I stretched us too much [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1825.76s)]
*  We did a good job opening up in Lafayette, which is the first one Lafayette, Louisiana first one out of the market [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1830.56s)]
*  Crushed it there. But then I'm like I gotta hit Dallas and Houston. There's LSU grads there, but I grew in both those markets [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1834.96s)]
*  I didn't set them up properly. I grew too quick [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1840.72s)]
*  I'm a butt kicked in both of them lost a bunch of money till I could bring it back up [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1842.96s)]
*  Series of things like that and now what so if there was suggest so how would you have done it different? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1846.24s)]
*  Looking back on it a little bit if you could have done it different well, just so people can learn. Yeah. Yeah [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1851.12s)]
*  So for me personally it uh [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1854.9599999999998s)]
*  And now with the scale of the business is it was actually good for me to go and make those mistakes because now [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1856.9599999999998s)]
*  Like I know it sounds like a hundred locations Dallas a lot, but look I'm 25 years in the business, right? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1861.84s)]
*  We're at that point I can open quality locations. So if I didn't learn the hard way, that's the way I learn [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1865.84s)]
*  You know, but if I if I didn't have to learn the hard way [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1870.6399999999999s)]
*  When I moved to Dallas and Houston to put those restaurants in there, I would have slowed down [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1873.76s)]
*  Made sure I had the right team and that they were properly supported [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1877.68s)]
*  I mean these people more people didn't have the right support for me. They worked themselves to the bone [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1880.64s)]
*  That didn't feel good, right? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1885.52s)]
*  I would go on the right way taking my time done it right now still quick [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1886.88s)]
*  You know and got open and did the things this but I would take a lot more time setting it up [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1890.64s)]
*  Plus the branding in those areas. I thought you just open the doors and everybody knew you and came in no [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1894.16s)]
*  No, it was like a ghost town [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1898.16s)]
*  Now i'm back on the streets trying to get people in and so I would have taken my time built up more streets [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1900.16s)]
*  I would have taken my time built a more strategic plan and then grew from there [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1904.8s)]
*  But that helped because when I went to new markets still to today look i'm coming into Nashville now [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1909.44s)]
*  I got the food truck here. It's going around to see people like seating the location [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1913.68s)]
*  I'm here personally people getting to know me things like that [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1918.0s)]
*  Those things have stayed with me and our openings since those times have been a lot more successful [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1920.8s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to hear some of that like uh, jimmy john or john leato [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1925.04s)]
*  You know he came he's been on the podcast and he stopped by this morning to say hey to you [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1928.24s)]
*  Which I thought was really nice. We'll go and um [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1931.52s)]
*  He talked about whenever they first started franchising [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1934.32s)]
*  How it just got away from him and the stores weren't how he needed them to be and [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1937.68s)]
*  He had to go on like a cross-country tour to all of the locations [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1942.16s)]
*  Yeah, and this and and either buy them back from the people if they felt like it wasn't really the right fit or [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1946.24s)]
*  To keep them, you know to inspire them and kind of you know [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1952.16s)]
*  Give actually put his stamp on on the way it should be done right and to help them, you know [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1954.8799999999999s)]
*  And uh, I thought that was pretty fascinating that that seemed like a moment where he really had to get back out there [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1959.92s)]
*  And almost do more work than you had to do in the beginning [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1964.88s)]
*  Absolutely, because you know entrepreneurs you're excitable and you want to grow and you want to build you create look [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1967.2s)]
*  That's our art. Our art is our business is growing right and spreading it [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1972.48s)]
*  We get happy when new people become braving fans of our brands [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1976.3200000000002s)]
*  It's it's it's what our gift of the world is [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1979.3600000000001s)]
*  And uh, but you get you get sucked in and you grow too quick and then you gotta go back and fix it [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1981.6000000000001s)]
*  It's way harder to fix it than to go in the right way [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1985.92s)]
*  Yeah, and so the right way would be what just a little bit just be a little more patient [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1988.48s)]
*  You think like let things take longer than you think they're going to yeah look go in with the right team [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1992.96s)]
*  And so look so my growth i'm i'm just about all company restaurants in the united states [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=1998.24s)]
*  I got the franchise. Sorry just so we know well so like so most of the people at quick service are franchise models, right? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2002.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes, you have corporate they have you know, all the intellectual properties the name like mcdonnell's is a franchise model franchise model, right? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2008.08s)]
*  Subways franchise model taco bell and so they have the systems and processes then you go with [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2015.04s)]
*  Local franchisees who basically license or franchise your concept and then they go run those restaurants and they do it [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2020.24s)]
*  You lose a lot of control when you do that, you know [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2026.48s)]
*  You have to have a real good franchisees [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2028.4s)]
*  And so for me, I would rather open company restaurants because I can control them. I mean I want these things run [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2030.0s)]
*  Exceptionally well is all personal to me and so I have more control and I choose to partner with the restaurant [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2036.06s)]
*  Partner I have at that restaurant who he or she is like working their butt off [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2041.9199999999998s)]
*  They're the todd graves in their trade area where they live and so for me is it's a lot more debt [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2046.1599999999999s)]
*  You know people from corporations will franchise because the local franchisees will have to put in the debt on the building and [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2051.2799999999997s)]
*  You know all the startup money and things like that. I'd rather take that on with my credit facility partner with my internal people [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2056.96s)]
*  Let them become [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2063.2s)]
*  Wealthy and and their family get to enjoy that and to do it [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2064.72s)]
*  But so but taking your time is setting it up getting the right people during your restaurant whether it's a franchisee or its company [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2068.08s)]
*  You know, you need to set those people up for success [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2075.44s)]
*  You need to train train overtrain [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2077.2s)]
*  You need to have so much support going in to get them started because it's hard to get get that [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2079.36s)]
*  Cash flow going it's hard to get that buzz going in your community. So slowing down being strategic with growth [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2083.2799999999997s)]
*  And i'm glad you're bringing this up because this is someone might be listening right now [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2089.2s)]

*  You will have to come back and fix it and then you'll slow down your growth so much [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2095.44s)]
*  Set it up with the right people train properly then give them support [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2099.8399999999997s)]

*  Damn, I believe that man. I remember those days. They always had the combs in that little cup [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2223.86s)]
*  I thought that thing remember that blue liquid or whatever. I was sitting in there. I always felt like it was for your dad [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2228.98s)]
*  You know, yeah [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2234.02s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. What was that? I don't know. It's that dust. Yeah [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2240.9s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, it was a little bit school. Yeah, it was a little bit [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2248.1s)]
*  I always left out of there looking like benjamin franklin a little bit. I feel like [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2251.46s)]
*  Um, we got a question that came up right here for you. Uh, let's get into it [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2255.14s)]
*  Hi, todd and theo, this is ethan from long beach, california [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2260.2599999999998s)]
*  Todd i'm a huge fan of your company. Everyone at your stores is always in such a good mood and is so friendly [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2263.64s)]
*  Um, I would love to hear more about this restaurant recovery project you're doing [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2269.32s)]
*  It sounds like an awesome cause to support small businesses [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2273.4s)]
*  And yeah, I really think it's going to be a great thing for especially during this time. Have a great day [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2276.6800000000003s)]
*  Thanks brother. Hey, thank you [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2282.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so when the pandemic started our business sales actually went up. Okay. Okay, so we have drive-through format [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2284.36s)]
*  So that became a thing [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2290.68s)]
*  I don't know if you remember when it when it started of course you do but [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2291.7999999999997s)]
*  It was like essential business and like people couldn't go to restaurants, but they could go through drive-throughs [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2294.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. So drive-through was suddenly just the luckiest thing on earth, dude [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2298.8399999999997s)]
*  Exactly. And so many like our sales go up, but we're up like 10 even up to 20 percent, right? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2302.44s)]
*  It didn't feel good because where we're getting that business from was these family-owned independent restaurants and predominantly dine-in [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2307.56s)]
*  As I thought what we could do and I mean I got on social media and stuff like support small business [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2314.2s)]
*  Think about going to them their suffering us chains are fine, you know, and it's like what can I do? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2317.96s)]
*  I've done tv before I understand the the power of it and I said well, you know what being an entrepreneur [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2322.6800000000003s)]
*  I said look I went hired up a production company started restaurant recovery [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2327.08s)]
*  I knew I could do it during that time. My team was good. So I picked 10 markets where kane's [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2330.6s)]
*  Markets are so I could use our help with our people pick these [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2335.1600000000003s)]
*  legendary [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2338.6600000000003s)]
*  Restaurants these family restaurants are just really going through a hard time took in a team kind of like an extreme home makeover deal [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2340.12s)]
*  Got him exposure involved a lot of my celeb friends to come help out too, which was really special and yeah [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2345.64s)]
*  I saw rob schnider did one. Yeah. Yes. I was nice enough to come out and do uh the phoenix episode and like just this family [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2350.2s)]
*  She's a pakistani lady and does the business with her son omar and I mean look they they they serve just really really good food [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2356.2799999999997s)]
*  But they're in tempe and the university shut down no classes. They're [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  Gone, you know overnight and so I brought rob in uh, also deandre hopkins came in [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2368.68s)]
*  Oh, that's cool dude. He came in the monday after the catch and his famous catch in the end zone [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2373.3999999999996s)]
*  And so I got him to come out and these are just community guys, right? So [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2377.8799999999997s)]
*  Uh rob's like yes, i'll help out deandre's like yes i'll come out so deandre fired up my team [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2381.16s)]
*  We had to get this thing done in 48 hours. So he started off. They were like wow [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2385.8799999999997s)]
*  Work production even went higher than I could think because this group works real hard [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2389.8799999999997s)]
*  And then rob came in with a family like look there you just see the stress on their face [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2393.3199999999997s)]
*  But him coming in funny guy caring they're laughing like look what's what's we're gonna get through this together really great man and [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2396.44s)]
*  Basically, the thing I was able to see more than anything else is they're all pretty predominantly dining room business [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2403.16s)]
*  That was gone taken away. So I needed to put them into like make them a to-go machine, right? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2408.92s)]
*  Which sounds easy, but it's not like to do it, right? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2413.96s)]
*  You got to have mobile ordering you got to have curbside delivery takes a lot of technology, right? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2416.52s)]
*  Right. It's not something a restaurant owner is just trying to keep the business open every day doing [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2420.52s)]
*  Racking up credit card debt keeping their people employed. Yes, but you could do that, right? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2425.3999999999996s)]
*  Especially if it's not a man like a you know, you think of a small business guy [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2429.56s)]
*  He shows up [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2432.36s)]
*  He puts the pot on the stove in the morning and starts making the gazpacho or whatever it is like [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2433.0s)]
*  so yeah that person isn't going to go from that to having that app or that ability to to uh, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2437.64s)]
*  To make things move they don't have the resources for that right so I could go in and help them do that and then preserve [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2442.7599999999998s)]
*  These places right? I mean look [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2447.72s)]
*  You know, i'm a chain and I like getting business obviously right we do a good job and we work hard for it [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2450.2799999999997s)]
*  But we have all the advantages. I got a huge marketing budget, right? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2456.12s)]
*  I got big shiny buildings right in the best locations and people see that and it's that constant state of mind [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2460.12s)]
*  So what I try to tell people is hey, i'm glad you came to canes [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2465.16s)]
*  But look think about that neighborhood restaurant that you love like they need your business [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2467.96s)]
*  They don't make that much money and when they're gone they get replaced by high rise or a chain [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2471.96s)]
*  And we don't need any more of those [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2477.24s)]
*  We need those legendary restaurants diversity of thoughts small business go to that small hardware store [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2478.2799999999997s)]
*  You got to go to the big box to get some stuff go that little hardware shop go [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2482.92s)]
*  Go support that small business a background backbone of our country plus different thoughts it makes things great [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2485.88s)]
*  They're the cultural centers of our neighborhood. We need to support them. Yeah [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2491.0800000000004s)]
*  Do you worry about I know like minimum wage increase and stuff like that [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2494.44s)]
*  Do you worry about that affecting businesses like I I hear stuff about like that. Do you worry about that affecting small businesses? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2497.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I worry about the people that just don't have enough sales to support it and might not have as sophisticated pricing strategies [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2502.76s)]
*  Okay, so for me [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2509.7200000000003s)]
*  You know quick service restaurants might make between five and ten percent bottom line [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2511.56s)]
*  Okay, so everybody that comes in you're doing good if you made five cents on a dollar [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2516.6s)]
*  Ten ten cents on a dollar you're doing great [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2520.92s)]
*  And so that means if somebody spends a dollar you make ten cents you make doing well [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2523.0s)]
*  It's usually five between five cents and ten cents. So there's just not much margin there [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2526.44s)]
*  Right and between that five and ten cents for every dollar spent there [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2530.6s)]
*  When you have commodity pressures and things like that, which the price of chicken goes up [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2534.36s)]
*  Then it just goes down and so you just got slim margins. That's four before taxes [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2537.96s)]
*  That's five cents to ten cents a dollar before then you go get the taxes [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2541.8s)]
*  So if I spend ten dollars at a raising canes or at a what's quick service you talk? Yeah quick service fast food [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2545.0s)]
*  Okay, so if I spend ten dollars at a quick service restaurant [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2551.0s)]
*  Then if they're making ten cents of that so if they're making a dollar out of ten dollars that I spend then they're doing well [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2554.44s)]
*  Doing well, that's ten percent doing well then that's before taxes. Wow, and that's real numbers, huh? That's real numbers [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2560.6s)]
*  And so when you think about it [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2565.48s)]
*  we don't have margin to share right because [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2567.8s)]
*  um [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2571.0s)]
*  If labor prices go up, right and you got to do it you have to pass it on to the customer [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2572.04s)]
*  There's no way that you can just apply because if it goes below five percent and gets lower [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2577.08s)]
*  You can't lose money. Well, and then you can't go you're not going to go put the [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2581.8s)]
*  Investment into build and grow and create more jobs and do it right? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2585.22s)]
*  So the next location the ros not there and so you one you wouldn't spend the money and two the banks are gonna be like [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2588.12s)]
*  Hey, you're not making return on investment [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2593.0s)]
*  Like we're not going to continue to lend you money. And so just the margins are that small but so for me it doesn't [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2594.6s)]
*  It doesn't hurt canes because you're gonna eventually pass it on right? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2600.12s)]
*  Wages go up then you're gonna raise the price of the chicken finger box, right? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2604.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just gonna go up and we have and you can't do that overnight [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2607.4s)]
*  You have to stage into it. And so we're we just have a lot of resources man [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2610.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean like I have a strategy for pricing [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2613.96s)]
*  The tough part is for small business that don't think about that pricing and then they don't want to do it [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2616.44s)]
*  The next thing you know, their their margins go too small, but look it's going there $15 an hour minimum wage [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2621.08s)]
*  We're going there. I just I give advice to small business [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2627.88s)]
*  I'm like you have to pass it on and we're going to go up but plan your pricing strategies [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2630.44s)]
*  Ease into it and let your customers know. Hey, look just it's it's labor labor prices and so it goes up [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2635.32s)]
*  So it doesn't really concern me [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2640.68s)]
*  It's a pricing strategies for small business right because you have such a broad such a breadth of [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2642.68s)]
*  Of information you can pull in you can look at it and you can like plan on a big scale [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2647.8s)]
*  But for someone who's just kind of like made their menu and it's very basic and they're not thinking like oh [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2652.1200000000003s)]
*  Well if the cost of this goes up 50 cents [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2657.0s)]
*  Then I don't even make any money until probably six months down the line when they look at their books and like what happened [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2659.32s)]
*  What happened? That's exactly what happens and they don't these all these small business owners [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2664.2000000000003s)]
*  They are so reluctant to take price increases. They don't want their customers to pay them like I know you have to or you're gonna be out [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2667.6400000000003s)]
*  Of business, you know interesting about that about that about sometimes about [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2672.28s)]
*  People don't want to charge like I get that way sometimes like I don't want to make my tickets real expensive [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2676.76s)]
*  You know, I don't want to [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2681.7200000000003s)]
*  Even though sometimes i'll see other people like holy smokes, you know that guy's tickets that price that's crazy, you know [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2684.76s)]
*  But i'll get nervous about that. I I don't know if you know if it's nervous. I don't want to bother [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2690.52s)]
*  I don't want to [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2695.08s)]
*  I don't know what it is. I know I think I might take a crack at it [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2696.6s)]
*  You started from nothing and you appreciate every fan [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2700.12s)]
*  And it means something to you so it's you take it personal right and so you generally hold back same with small business [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2704.04s)]
*  Right, they started from nothing. They've scratched it clawed and now they have a a living and they don't want to pass that on [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2709.4s)]
*  They're like I don't want to do that to my customers. I would imagine you're probably the same way [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2714.92s)]
*  Yeah, and it's exact opposite in big corporate america, especially in restaurants like those cevo types are like they already have their pricing [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2718.04s)]
*  Da da da da. It's not a personal decision. It's all a financial decision that they're doing. It's different for people that that care, you know [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2724.28s)]
*  Is it interesting at a certain point as you grow and as things turn more from like sit like manning a fryer to um [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2731.8s)]
*  To like [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2742.36s)]
*  Business like I noticed with business the more business I start doing the more business I have to do [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2743.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know and so it's tough because [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2748.6800000000003s)]
*  You want to grow and you want to make things bigger and give other people opportunities? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2751.7200000000003s)]
*  but it also like [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2757.64s)]
*  It's it's tough to be like how much is enough business, you know, how much is enough [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2760.2799999999997s)]
*  Revenue like how much is enough? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2765.48s)]
*  You know have there been moments in your world where you've kind of battled with that kind of stuff or yeah, absolutely [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2767.08s)]
*  You know all on the way and so [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2772.6s)]
*  What I had to set for myself was my personal goals and what ultimately I see happiness being for me [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2775.64s)]
*  Okay, and so I set the vision for raising canes and this is our vision statement [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2783.3199999999997s)]
*  Is to have locations all over the world be known as the brand for quality chicken finger meals [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2787.8s)]
*  Okay, great crew cool culture and active community involvement. Okay, so that's me happiness, right? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2792.6800000000003s)]
*  And so look I believe god made me good at this for a reason and that's to be able to help people right? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2799.48s)]
*  But when I set that vision you think about it's not just I want to have locations all the world [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2804.28s)]
*  There's nothing about I want to make a bunch of money. I know that all these things in there. It's literally [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2807.48s)]
*  Wow went to canes great food then oh wow friendly crew cool culture [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2812.04s)]
*  And then they give money back and they work in the communities. So that's guided me, right? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2817.3999999999996s)]
*  And so when I know what I know I need to do that then i'm going to grow it [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2821.16s)]
*  And so mine's an infinite vision like I I won't see it all over the world [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2824.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean i'm gonna we're starting to grow but I can't develop the whole world, you know [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2828.12s)]
*  I mean by the time i'm you know [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2831.96s)]
*  God willing i'll live a long life, but you know those things are going so that's helped to guide me, right? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2834.2s)]
*  And so I passed up my financial goals really early on and so for me is when time hits the grind hits and it always hits [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2838.92s)]
*  It kept me motivated when I didn't have the team around me that helped support me [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2847.56s)]
*  I always had people that worked hard and did but I couldn't afford the teams I do now, right? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2851.32s)]
*  I knew I'd get to this point and look by the grace of god right now [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2855.64s)]
*  I got really really solid teams very most more smarter than I am and in the respect of things they do [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2859.32s)]
*  So we're a stronger team and I feel like now just now and i'm pushing 50 i'm 49 now almost 25 years in business just now [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2864.36s)]
*  That i'm not like waking up every morning with that thing in my belly, but i'm i'm hitting that vision. So uh, wow anyway [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2871.8s)]
*  But different times it hit i'm like, oh my god, todd, you know [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2877.0s)]
*  You're so stressed out, you know, you haven't you haven't [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2880.44s)]
*  Relaxed or you haven't done time family and things like that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2883.64s)]
*  And then I was like but look that vision puts me through ultimately it's going to really help people [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2887.0s)]
*  And and you just kind of stick with it and go, you know [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2890.76s)]
*  And so that was just my personal thing [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2893.48s)]
*  And so that's paid off by setting real goals like people need to set real goals and real vision [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2894.92s)]
*  Because then you what you're working for some people get beyond that and look they don't want to grow like me all over the world [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2899.56s)]
*  They want to do certain things in all walks of life and then they get lost in [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2903.64s)]
*  Wait a minute. This isn't what I really wanted to do and it wasn't what I wanted to do to be happy, right? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2907.32s)]
*  So now they're bigger they're this but they're not happy right and that it's kind of a heartbreaker [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2910.84s)]
*  You know at times, you know, something people need to think strategically. Where am I going? You know? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2915.0s)]
*  It's interesting man. Yeah, I think about that sometimes like I think one of our original goals with podcasting was just to kind of share [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2919.4s)]
*  What we're thinking and feeling and then to we started getting in like helping and like giving back [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2924.6000000000004s)]
*  And we do some stuff for single moms and things like that where we try to [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2929.0s)]
*  We haven't gotten it like incorporated yet so we could make it like a real non-profit, you know that that arm of it [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2932.1200000000003s)]
*  But I certainly hope to at some point. Um, but sometimes I have to remember that that's what's kind of important [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2937.96s)]
*  You know, yeah that's leaving something positive [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2943.08s)]
*  You know, it almost feels so stale to make money if there's not some positive part of it in a way [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2945.96s)]
*  There's got to be something greater than us to go do it, right? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2951.4s)]
*  And look man, i'm at a point now where I can do a lot of things and with the scale of business and do it giving [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=2955.48s)]

*  Yeah control deal and i'm extremely detailed and this is my baby [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3293.48s)]
*  And so over time it really hindered me it really did it hurt our growth it hurt our [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3297.1600000000003s)]
*  Creative thinking because I was just overly overly controlling and then I learned it's kind of a maturity thing right over time [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3302.84s)]
*  Then you say hey you look at a series of getting screwed up and getting beat up and getting tired and all those things along the way [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3310.52s)]
*  You're like look I need to bring in people and the biggest strength as you build your team [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3316.28s)]
*  Does bring in people that are smarter than you you know, not a threat bring in people that are good at their own respective ways [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3320.04s)]
*  And then you do it, but it doesn't mean not being a detailed oriented [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3325.4s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're not into the details and you're not helping people say like oh just delegate like just delegate [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3328.52s)]
*  What kind of word is that? No, it's it's work with great leaders, but still be in the details [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3333.96s)]
*  But then it helps to scale you so I had to learn that way and I tell you it's the best [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3338.2000000000003s)]
*  Of my workload thinking about right now six other locations. We'll do 100 next year [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3342.84s)]
*  But my workload is better than it ever has been in my balance of life because i've trusted my teams [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3346.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm into the details, right? I'm still doing that [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3351.1600000000003s)]
*  But i've trusted people to come in that are better than me and grow so that was a big big maturity learning for me [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3354.36s)]
*  Man, it's hard. It's hard. Is it hard and then you screw up again? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3360.2000000000003s)]
*  and then you run people off because they're like I don't hear about things and so [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3363.7200000000003s)]
*  I finally and like I said now i'm pushing 50. I've really kind of matured into that doing but it's interesting interesting too [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3367.8s)]
*  It's like and it's really important. It's not details. You should be in the details [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3373.6400000000003s)]
*  So people used to tell me the experts again like you just won't know what these things are going on [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3377.48s)]
*  You can't do these things when you get big right? Well, i'm bigger than all of them now, right? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3381.96s)]

*  They said you can't keep writing notes to people he wrote a thousand notes the other day, right? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3390.44s)]
*  He's like i'm going to take my time and do the things because i'm going to scale [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3394.6s)]
*  you know, um [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3399.0s)]

*  There was just this rampant spending on bottle waters. No one was looking at he said look [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3416.12s)]
*  it's not just the bottle waters our company makes billions of dollars, but [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3420.04s)]
*  That carries over to everything else him staying in the details like most successful people I know stay in the details, but they trust people [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3423.64s)]
*  Interesting balance. It's hard [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3431.16s)]
*  It's hard man. It is hard and then you get your butt kicked so many times and finally you kind of [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3433.0s)]
*  Settle into it and see the see the strength of it almost out of exhaustion, huh? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3437.72s)]
*  Were you surprised whenever you started to trust people how things flourished were you almost shocked? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3441.48s)]
*  Absolutely, and it was also trial and error me getting used to it and also trusted some people that weren't [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3445.94s)]

*  Because oil is gonna dry up one day, right? You know what I mean? Like working women, you know [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=3854.04s)]

*  And they would have all their clothes draped over them that they were going to wear after the after they played [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4147.88s)]

*  Okay [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4198.92s)]
*  The people I think are coolest in this world are the ones that are working hard and they have good values, right? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4199.080000000001s)]
*  I don't know many successful people [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4204.52s)]
*  That don't that aren't good people, you know, jalen ramsay's here in town. He's a superstar on his deal [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4206.76s)]

*  But it's all about that stuff [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4223.72s)]
*  and so it makes me feel good about our country because when you have I like supporting celebrities and their kind of charity because [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4225.4800000000005s)]
*  It gets amplified and that mean where people say if these superstars have this humility and they got these values [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4231.0s)]
*  Then I want to be I want to be like them right role models just like you you will not believe your influence [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4237.320000000001s)]
*  That goes through to other people and the things you're doing just like our man nate just said [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4242.92s)]
*  He really appreciates you and an inspiration to him [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4246.92s)]
*  And I think all of us whether you're chicken finger famous or here are are are in your world [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4249.5599999999995s)]
*  We need to be good examples [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4254.92s)]
*  These things that matter man some of these things that don't matter. They don't matter in those people's lives. We need we need inspiration [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4256.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's uh, especially these days. It's tough because a lot of mainstream media seems like it battles against that [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4262.84s)]
*  They don't you know, it's not like and that could just be not even true [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4267.48s)]
*  I mean, but it seems like there's a lot of dark arts that are more out there at play [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4271.16s)]
*  yeah, so it almost seems like a time better to kind of lean into the good and [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4275.0s)]
*  Uh and just try our best more than ever right now leaning to the good leaning to the positive support each other [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4278.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah as a society but like pitting people against each other and making sensationalism out of it making money off people being against each other [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4292.599999999999s)]
*  Wrong move for our country wrong move. It's gonna get [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4300.44s)]
*  So bad that they don't have to cycle back because people are stuck [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4304.360000000001s)]
*  They're not listening as much to the to the negative and the sensationalism. They're starting to figure it out [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4307.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think that's pretty cool to see um when so when you look to your horizon of life like, uh [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4313.320000000001s)]

*  Not take a break, but i've achieved [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4322.76s)]
*  I've achieved you know, I think there's a thing inside of entrepreneurs like some girl asked me the other day [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4326.360000000001s)]
*  She goes how is your life like now? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4331.24s)]
*  You know you kind of have some of the things that you want or you've achieved some of your successes some of your goals [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4333.24s)]
*  And I was like man, it's not really [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4337.96s)]
*  That different the gas pedal that's always kind of had me be like I want to do stuff [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4340.679999999999s)]
*  Has never really [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4345.8s)]
*  The foot never really comes off it. I don't think it's always kind of this [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4348.2s)]
*  Now what kind of thing like not always in a bigger way, but now what? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4352.679999999999s)]
*  Maybe in a more important way or now what? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4357.0s)]
*  Um in more of a human way, you know, it might have it has evolved some but um was there a moment where you kind of realized? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4359.96s)]
*  Okay [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4365.96s)]
*  Ah, you know a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, so [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4367.639999999999s)]
*  uh financially right so [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4370.599999999999s)]
*  We we hit on this earlier but like growing it meeting my wife [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4373.5599999999995s)]
*  Didn't go through now. I got kids. I'm highly leveraged [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4377.639999999999s)]
*  I want them to go and have things now. I'm not talking rules royces and stuff, but like education [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4381.16s)]
*  Decent house, you know things like this and so [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4387.74s)]
*  That was a big one because I was leveraging the business too much and the big lesson to me is I had 28 locations when hurricane [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4390.62s)]
*  Katrina hit all south, Louisiana [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4396.54s)]
*  Okay, mostly south, Louisiana 21 to 28 those went down [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4398.62s)]
*  I had levered the business what I was doing is banking back then was was was a lot more lenient [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4402.299999999999s)]
*  And what I would do is i'd go in a community find a community bank [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4408.139999999999s)]
*  Then i'd have a a sub debt investor meaning subordinated debt to the bank [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4411.98s)]
*  I could go raise 100 200 000 [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4416.299999999999s)]
*  And give them a subordinated note to the bank means the bank gets their money first [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4419.82s)]
*  And but i'm gonna pay you a 15 return [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4424.0599999999995s)]
*  This is just kind of my entrepreneurial financing what I did and the banks would actually kind of use that as equity saying what? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4426.0599999999995s)]
*  You got two hundred thousand dollars. It's like an equity thing terrible thing. You're just totally leveraging yourself [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4431.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. It's a lot [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4436.139999999999s)]
*  But I was able to do all these locations and ding ding ding and I don't want to sell [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4437.5s)]
*  I didn't want private equity partners [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4440.379999999999s)]
*  I wanted I wanted to own it and control it [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4441.5s)]
*  And but when it went down so like our restaurants and open a restaurant [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4443.58s)]
*  So first paycheck to crew members is two weeks [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4447.74s)]
*  I got sales coming in pay the vendors 30 days, right pay rent in 30 days [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4451.26s)]
*  So I was creating cash right like I didn't have to do my expenses [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4456.38s)]
*  Sales are coming in. So when I kept opening these locations [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4459.9s)]
*  I kept creating cash for the company and kept growing highly levered it totally stupid by the way because also that katrina comes in [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4462.38s)]

*  I mean and I would have bounced back and came back but it wouldn't be what we are today [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4474.0599999999995s)]
*  Wow, but we were able to rally our troops [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4477.74s)]
*  We were the first ones to open our business survived and did well [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4480.0599999999995s)]
*  But i'll never forget that deal and then it stayed with me that ache in my belly like because i'm putting everything towards canes [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4483.42s)]
*  Everything's leveraged. I mean monsters debt and I just didn't have that nest egg for my family [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4489.339999999999s)]
*  You know, what does something happen to me? You know what I mean? What happens to mom or whatever? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4494.46s)]

*  Yeah [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4504.62s)]
*  So it that felt good when I was able to put money aside and do that and put it away [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4505.34s)]
*  But you know and and so that was like a [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4509.74s)]
*  But with that vision and what I want to do like to me is I keep working hard for that vision because I know it's my purpose [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4512.14s)]
*  Right, right, and I believe with people like us. Okay, like when you create and do [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4518.06s)]
*  You're never going to stop creating and doing because it's part of what you are [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4522.94s)]
*  It's part of your dna and I do I do firmly believe this if you're not going ahead [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4527.259999999999s)]
*  It doesn't need to be this but if you're not moving forward on things if you're not [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4531.74s)]
*  Creating if you're not working you're not doing things then you're sliding behind [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4535.259999999999s)]
*  There's no coast like in all my life's experience is you always got to kind of do if we're this way [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4539.0199999999995s)]
*  Whether it's this or this we have to keep going like if you stop you slip back [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4545.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and look at people that which I think is retirement, you know, if some people want to retire [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4549.26s)]
*  I think that's when they're hey, i'm gonna go fishing more i'm gonna do all those things is but if you're staying in the game [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4552.540000000001s)]
*  You're always gonna go [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4556.860000000001s)]
*  Never being satisfied and that's a terrible saying right but like always wanting more is better way [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4558.780000000001s)]
*  And that's how you said it is is a good thing because you want to push yourself if you're satisfied and you say this is perfect [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4563.580000000001s)]
*  This is saying we've we've achieved it [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4569.900000000001s)]
*  You know like that's the second you think you bait it is a time to be showing the door, right? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4571.5s)]
*  You know, you gotta push and do because you don't want to go back [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4575.66s)]
*  And you want to keep creating and doing good things and it keeps you sharp and it keeps you going [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4579.18s)]
*  But it's important to celebrate your successes. And what we won't do is we'll do all these great things with our business [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4583.42s)]
*  But we won't stop and say hey [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4588.54s)]
*  Let's celebrate. I mean it's for an hour. I feel like nick saving after after damn Alabama wins again [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4590.3s)]

*  You're right man, somebody told me that the other day said man [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4604.299999999999s)]
*  Sometimes you got to look you you always want to do more for other people and want to make people feel good [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4606.54s)]
*  And you don't even look and realize [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4611.82s)]

*  Then you'll go do more. Yeah [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4620.86s)]
*  you know, I thought it was really interesting how you said where your vision meets your [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4622.86s)]
*  vision and purpose and how they kind of can interchange and how [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4625.9s)]
*  I think it'd be really interesting to just kind of have that in people's minds and hearts like [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4629.179999999999s)]
*  As almost like a a graha a chart or something where it's like, yeah, well your vision and your purpose [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4633.820000000001s)]
*  Because those are two different things, but they're very [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4639.820000000001s)]
*  This they're similar, but they're [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4642.3s)]
*  One is almost more of a divine and one is almost more of a will. Yeah, and I think it's interesting. Um [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4644.54s)]
*  That's well well said if you can tangle those up almost braid them in a way [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4651.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, um, I braid them just by I know what my purpose is and the vision with the business is going to get us there [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4655.820000000001s)]
*  Right [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4662.139999999999s)]
*  Then setting setting goals, right? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4663.339999999999s)]
*  So we're kane's is going to be 25 in august and they're like how you want to celebrate? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4665.339999999999s)]

*  But setting those personal goals too, then then you get a plan behind it. What can we do with these things, right? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4675.58s)]
*  So that's that vision strategy the will other side the purpose is more divine. Why are you here? What is your purpose? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4680.7s)]
*  Yeah, and ask ourselves that and answer it honestly to ourselves too, you know [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4688.06s)]

*  You just have to rise above it. You know, you just have to believe in what your purpose is what your goal is [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZZzuUVyhM&t=4922.780000000001s)]
