*  Mr. Louis CK. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=100.56s)]
*  I sweat more when it's cold, weirdly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=112.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=131.64000000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=138.84s)]
*  We used to have a buddy, I was sitting about sweating, but it made me think about reptiles [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=140.48s)]
*  that I used to work on this farm and we had a dude after it would rain, he would go lay [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=143.88s)]
*  on the concrete up there. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  He'd take his shirt off and go lay on the concrete. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  Like a reptile kind of guy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=151.76s)]
*  Because he felt good. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=155.2s)]
*  It cools off. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=156.2s)]
*  That's like what dogs do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=157.2s)]
*  They sit on the hearth, you know? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=158.2s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=159.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=160.56s)]
*  They sit somewhere. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=161.56s)]
*  They find cool spot on the floor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=162.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=163.56s)]
*  I think it just felt good on his skin. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=164.56s)]
*  After it would rain, he would take his shirt off. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=165.56s)]
*  He's with a guy, he's with a dude named Lance. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=168.28s)]
*  He was really in touch with what made him feel good. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=171.28s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people won't do that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  But he's like, I know that feels good so I'm going to do it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=182.0s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is kind of nice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=184.0s)]
*  I think there's probably more stuff people would do in public if they were less probably [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=185.0s)]
*  inhibited or whatever about it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=191.96s)]
*  I was in a… [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=192.96s)]
*  We move this a little closer on you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=193.96s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I was in. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=195.24s)]
*  I think, you know, those places that are like [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  it's like a chain restaurant, but it's a little bit, you know what I mean? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=202.4s)]
*  A little better. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=205.24s)]
*  Mm, yeah, like like like like BJs. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that kind of thing. Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=210.16s)]
*  I forget what it was, but it was daytime and it was really dead in there [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=211.28s)]
*  in some, I don't know, Akron, Ohio or some horrible place. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=214.8s)]
*  And and some big lady came in, you know, off the street. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=218.16s)]
*  And you could tell they were like, OK, like they they have something [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  where they just like just let her come in. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. Let her come in. Let her smell everything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe they she's got stopped at the door one day and it got [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=232.12s)]
*  so you don't even consider like, OK, you see they went to the manager. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  He's like, it's OK. It's OK. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=238.32s)]
*  It wasn't enough customers in there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  She came in and she just started walking through the restaurant [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=241.52s)]
*  and she takes the creamers, you know, the those metal tin creamers [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=244.24s)]
*  that are on the kind of places. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=248.0s)]
*  She starts drinking cream and then she leaves. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  And I thought. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=254.96s)]
*  If I wasn't worried about how that looks, I might do that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=260.32s)]
*  Yeah. Like this something about creamers is like as a kid, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=262.12s)]
*  that's kind of magical. That's ice cream. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=265.32s)]
*  Maybe she knows the time they just poured them, so they're nice and cold. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=267.76s)]
*  But if you'd had no concern about right, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=270.8s)]
*  you might walk by a restaurant, go, I bet they got some nice cold creamers [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=274.2s)]
*  and I'm going to have myself. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=277.44s)]
*  Yeah, I can see that coming through and just kind of sniffing the creamers [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=280.68s)]
*  just having some just being always want to like touch people [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=284.0s)]
*  on the back of their neck. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=287.8s)]
*  Yeah. Wow, that's an interesting one. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  Because I feel like it's like the most kind of like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=291.76s)]
*  it's almost like a real parental place. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=294.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's caring. It's yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=297.12s)]
*  So you mean you're the parent? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=299.68s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, maybe I would dress up in a suit or something, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=302.08s)]
*  but I don't know if I would be like the parent, but I just [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=304.4s)]
*  yes, sometimes I want to do that even when I'm just talking to people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=309.12s)]
*  I want to like almost like if I put my hand on the back of their neck, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=312.04s)]
*  we would know more about each other or something. Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=316.0s)]
*  You'd be closer. You'd be an arm's length away. Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=318.16s)]
*  When I was in school and middle school, that moment. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to escape it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=324.36s)]
*  So then I think you're there with like the honesty of whatever's really going on. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=325.48s)]
*  When I was in middle school, if you got in a fight, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=331.12s)]
*  they made you stand in the hall all day and hug each other like this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=332.88s)]
*  No shit. Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  Like what do you mean? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=338.68s)]
*  Like hands on each other's shoulders, each other's shoulders, slow dance. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=339.32000000000005s)]

*  But yeah, we were out there and the kids would come through during the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=360.72s)]
*  like, and you try to be kind of cool, like while it was a while it was like [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=363.68s)]
*  while it was in class, you would try to like just like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  be like you was kind of relaxed and be cool with each other. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=371.72s)]
*  And then when the kids with the bell would ring and they would switch classes, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=374.32s)]
*  you'd be like, this is fucking gay, dude. Right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=377.32s)]
*  You know, you would like. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=379.44s)]
*  But then you're alone out there during class time. Yeah. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  So you'd have to get to know each other. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=383.0s)]
*  So you really would talk, probably. Right. Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=384.44s)]
*  I mean, there'd be like a period of just like, man, fuck this. Fuck you, man. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But then you start going. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  So what would you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  like, what are you doing after school or where you, you know, is your [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=395.16s)]
*  you have sisters, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=398.76s)]

*  So I like that. I think, yeah, there's something about that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=403.32s)]
*  Smart idea. The only that pose of hands on shoulders. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=406.44s)]
*  It reminds me of when I was I mean, that was middle school. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=411.8s)]
*  So this was fifth, sixth grade kids, boys and girls started [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=414.76s)]
*  saying they want to be boyfriend, girlfriend, you know, they started to be that thing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=420.2s)]
*  And it was only the cool kids that could do that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=424.24s)]
*  Like anybody that was below, you know, in the nerdy or just not popular. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=426.36s)]
*  Anybody that glasses on was out. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=430.04s)]
*  And I had no currency. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. But all the cool kids got to hook up. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=433.48s)]
*  Yeah. And so they would be like Mike McDougall and Samantha [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  Amanda Stebbins, these real people are going to kiss. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=441.68s)]

*  You didn't just walk up to like I did. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=447.24s)]
*  I walked up to girls and said, you want to be my girlfriend? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=449.04s)]
*  They're like, yeah, flag of the play, buddy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=451.24s)]
*  That's not how it's done. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  That's like somebody coming off the sidelines and just getting in the play. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=455.52000000000004s)]

*  are going to be a couple. Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=467.56s)]

*  And they'd have to go to some place and kiss the tree or something. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=473.68s)]
*  Yeah. And they would stand like that with hands on shoulders, just that exact. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=478.04s)]
*  And they'd be like looking like trying to look to the sides and everybody's going, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=481.96000000000004s)]

*  your teeth. I never heard that your school must have. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=510.59999999999997s)]

*  I just saw him a couple of weeks ago. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=519.32s)]
*  And I thought, but I'll do that thing just to. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=520.96s)]
*  You should just once in a while. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=524.2s)]
*  It should be a regular thing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=526.96s)]
*  One shining moment. Yeah. Just saying a little. Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=528.44s)]
*  I'm it almost reminds me of Lord of the Flies, what you're talking about, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=532.84s)]
*  because it really was I never thought about it like that, like the whole tribe [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=535.84s)]
*  kind of had to agree that Scott and Jessica were going to kiss. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=538.92s)]
*  That's right. And then like if you were like, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=542.48s)]
*  like a little bitch, I would stand there and kind of like just like watch. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=545.0s)]
*  And like some people were right up there, like, you know, nudging him in. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  But some people in the back just yell and. Right. You know. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=550.68s)]
*  No, things were very tribal, medieval. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  There's microcosms there at those ages. Oh, yeah. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=558.92s)]
*  I had a friend who was very popular, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=562.28s)]

*  like in Lord of the Flies, you ever see the movie? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I did. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=702.48s)]
*  Well, it ends with just like this boot, this adult boot in the foreground. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It just stops all the madness. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=707.3199999999999s)]
*  Shut it down. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. In their own world, they're, you know. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=712.68s)]
*  It's so wild to think about that because, yeah, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=716.04s)]
*  I really get infatuated with those kind of times, man, like [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=719.28s)]
*  I love that kind of stuff. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=724.12s)]
*  I love growing up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  I love like the mystery of all of it, like how everything was so crazy. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=726.12s)]
*  And it was just. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=730.88s)]
*  And the things you could do, man, we used to [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=732.92s)]
*  like, I remember the first time I ever touched a girl's breast, right? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  They had this girl. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=739.68s)]
*  They had this dude in our neighborhood. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=740.8s)]
*  He was Elvis impersonator, right? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=742.12s)]
*  And like on stage or just in life. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=744.36s)]
*  I would say a little more life. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=749.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he walked around dressed like Elvis. Yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=752.48s)]
*  OK, he walked around. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he did as he did as good as he could to get, you know, to be there, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=756.92s)]
*  you know, and and anyway, yeah, he but he had. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=761.4s)]
*  Well, it's something happened to him. He got hit by he something. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=764.8399999999999s)]
*  He broke in a leg or something, and they said it like in a they got it set. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=768.12s)]
*  Just he got it set locally, basically had it like somebody do it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=771.92s)]
*  So when it broke again, he had like a [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  he had a natural. Yes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=779.04s)]
*  So he was halfway to Elvis right there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=780.64s)]
*  He had so that he started with that and he was like, hey, man, thank you very much. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=782.36s)]
*  I started getting into it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=786.48s)]
*  Yeah, he's just a nice guy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=787.92s)]
*  I don't think even Elvis got started like that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=789.0799999999999s)]
*  So at least you could say it was grassroots. Right. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  So or maybe he had a moment in the mirror where he's like this [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  because I could either walk around like this or I could put. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe it was a way to save it, you know. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=799.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think it probably saved him some face because he was probably very, very [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=802.04s)]
*  embarrassed. So anyway, his daughter, his kids, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=804.68s)]
*  he made him stay in the yard, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=808.48s)]
*  He had electric fence on their yard and they were Pentecostals. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=809.96s)]
*  And one of the girls let me touch her breasts through that fucking fence, dude. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=813.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, and she wore a mother's nightgown. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  I remember she wore like a like an adult woman. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=821.08s)]
*  And I missed the connection. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=824.5600000000001s)]
*  Who is she to the daughter? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=825.72s)]
*  OK. And how old were you? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  I was probably 10 or maybe 11. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=831.16s)]
*  And she was what? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=833.8000000000001s)]
*  Mm hmm. I don't know. 40. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=835.28s)]

*  I mean, it was a not a kid's breath. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. Well, yes. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=846.0799999999999s)]

*  Oh, yeah. The the electric chain link fence. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=862.28s)]
*  No, it was like a wire and it's not a barbed wire. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=865.92s)]
*  Pull up an electric fence, Zachary, if you don't mind. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=869.84s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's like on wood, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=872.0s)]

*  It wasn't like you were touching fence. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=883.88s)]
*  No, but it was so and this came up to the fence. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=885.64s)]
*  Yeah. Wearing her mother's nightgown. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=888.48s)]

*  I just want a little context. OK. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=897.32s)]
*  Like before and after. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=899.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because when I'm picturing with this, this picture that you're showing [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  of like this fence in his field, which is where electric fences [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=903.44s)]
*  are usually in a desolate place. Right. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=906.84s)]
*  This was on. I just pictured this girl with like wind [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=909.64s)]
*  flapping around this thing, and then you just come and then you just do this. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=912.72s)]
*  This was like the way you get, you know, like a scanning your hand [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=917.72s)]
*  so you can get into the into the chamber. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=920.88s)]
*  But I mean, I wasn't like, did you make a plan or did you see her across? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  Did you see her across the fence to go, hi, Becky? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=928.48s)]
*  And then you came to talk and then she said, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=931.0s)]
*  would you like to touch my breast? Was it like that? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=933.1600000000001s)]
*  I knew she liked me. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=935.36s)]
*  And I knew that they couldn't get out like their dad did not let [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=937.0400000000001s)]
*  like they didn't have a babysitter, so they would just lock the gate or whatever. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=940.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. This is the kind of those times. Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=943.2s)]
*  And so those times for some people. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean, it was like, yeah, in our area, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=948.08s)]
*  I think if you had a gate, that was your step. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=951.6s)]
*  That was like your dad. OK. You know, for a lot of people, Lachki kids. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=953.76s)]

*  Yeah, she knew I liked her. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=962.0400000000001s)]
*  And I guess I think she'd been a little bit somebody had she had dated. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=963.52s)]
*  I think she'd been on a date. OK. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=967.76s)]
*  So she had maybe a little more experience. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  I felt like she had that was at that age. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=971.64s)]
*  There was that thing where some of us had done it and some of us hadn't. Yeah. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=973.48s)]
*  Oh, and it was such a. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=977.48s)]

*  So then we were all in middle school or about to be in middle school. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1000.8s)]

*  of being in a child, especially when like sexualization came into things. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1271.96s)]
*  Just a giant. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1275.76s)]

*  And then you come out and you and you withhold. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1738.56s)]
*  He's Mexican and he had a weird sort of traditional. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1742.0s)]

*  And you saw him somewhere and he had another girlfriend. Yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  And she let us stay at her house. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1857.64s)]
*  He only ever had baloney and colic. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1858.76s)]
*  Oh, I'd never had brisket. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1861.0800000000002s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1862.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I was. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1863.48s)]
*  Yeah, I never even I never even couldn't imagine it. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1865.44s)]
*  And then he was walking down the hall [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1868.64s)]
*  and I thought he was going to like have sex with his at night time [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1872.28s)]
*  and I would sleep on their living room on the living room couch. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1874.84s)]
*  And then he literally. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1877.3600000000001s)]
*  He was sick and he defecated all over himself. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1880.96s)]
*  And it was like one of the scariest and craziest things that ever happened, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1884.48s)]
*  because I remember watching him and thinking, wow, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1887.3600000000001s)]
*  my dad's going to. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1890.48s)]
*  Like be with this lady, you know, and she was like wealthy [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1893.0400000000002s)]
*  and I don't even know why she even liked us, but she did. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1896.0400000000002s)]
*  And then he was sick, you know, and then I was so afraid to try to go [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1899.5200000000002s)]
*  to help or anything because he was like he had cancer and he was getting real sick. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1904.2s)]
*  I didn't know. Wow. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1908.6000000000001s)]
*  But it was that way anyway, that story took kind of a weird term, but [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1910.48s)]
*  yeah, that's just life, you know. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1914.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a moment where there was just a lot of life at once. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1916.44s)]
*  But so one interesting way you put it is you say what she didn't know why she liked us. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1919.1599999999999s)]
*  So you and your dad were like a unit. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1924.8s)]
*  You were like a team. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1926.3999999999999s)]
*  Like so did when he left, when your mom and when your mom and him divorced, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1927.1999999999998s)]
*  you went with dad. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1931.1599999999999s)]
*  No, I stayed with my mom, but I always felt like my dad was just more loving. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1932.32s)]
*  Yeah. My mom has like kind of like an emotional kind of autism. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1935.8s)]
*  Like she can't show you affection kind of. That's hard. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1938.56s)]
*  And a lot of parents like that. It's hard. Is there? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1941.6799999999998s)]
*  So it was just kind of like, but she's a hard worker and stuff. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1945.96s)]
*  But anyway, it was so then and I was kind of infatuated by my dad [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1949.08s)]
*  because nothing he did. He was older. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1953.4399999999998s)]
*  So everything was awful little. It didn't make sense. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1955.36s)]
*  And it was kind of I think it was more fascinating, you know, being around him. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1959.6s)]
*  Yeah, I felt that way about my dad a little bit [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1963.12s)]
*  because he wasn't like any of my friends, dads. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1965.6399999999999s)]
*  He was a strange guy, a Mexican and a very serious dude. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1967.32s)]
*  Yeah, a bit like a European Mexican, you know. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1972.12s)]
*  There's a lot of different kinds of Mexicans. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1974.72s)]
*  I lived there till I was about seven. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1977.16s)]
*  Oh, nice. But but yeah, he was weird. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1978.76s)]
*  So I kind of like I was fascinated by him, but he didn't show much interest. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1982.72s)]
*  He I just remember him always looking at his eye level. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1987.72s)]
*  He didn't look down at me much. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1990.56s)]
*  I just always looked up at his face and he was looking that way. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1992.36s)]
*  Wow. And it's that dude. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1995.76s)]
*  Well, it's hard, but I feel more bad for him [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  because he didn't he was alone up there. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2002.84s)]
*  I didn't think about that. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2005.24s)]
*  I do now because he's, you know, very, very old and in a chair like this. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2006.72s)]
*  And he's alone. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2012.28s)]
*  No, we don't we don't go see him much. Me and my sisters. Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2013.52s)]
*  And my mom, I mean, when she was she died in her last year of life, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2016.6799999999998s)]
*  when she was, you know, we were like there and kept her in our houses [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2021.3999999999999s)]
*  and kept took care of her till the last second. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2025.56s)]
*  She had us all around her. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2027.6799999999998s)]
*  Never alone, because she just was a loving person. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2029.92s)]
*  And she, you know, you wanted to be with her. Oh, wow. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2033.3200000000002s)]
*  But my dad was all fucked up in his own head and he was, you know, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2036.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, narcissism is like it's a sickness. Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2039.48s)]
*  And it's isolating. It's very sad. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2042.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, I feel bad for him now. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2044.48s)]
*  I'm able to feel bad for him because he was it was painful to be his kid, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2046.0s)]
*  you know, physically and mentally. So. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2050.84s)]
*  But I'm past that 55 years. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2054.12s)]
*  It takes a long time to, you know. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2057.32s)]
*  We surprise how long it took to get past that kind of stuff, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2058.88s)]
*  because I find it interesting. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2061.4s)]
*  A lot of audiences like kind of guys that kind of like are still figuring things out. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2062.7200000000003s)]
*  It's kind of like a lot of late bloomers. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2066.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think it and no judgment to any of the listeners. But [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2067.92s)]
*  yeah, I think a lot of young men are stuck in this time where it's like, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2072.04s)]
*  you know, we're fake. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2076.92s)]
*  It's almost like you're figuring your shit out, your parents shit out. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2077.8s)]
*  It's like it's almost come to like this kind of like curve in the pipe [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2080.6800000000003s)]
*  where it's like we got to kind of figure this shit out in here. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2084.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2086.48s)]
*  And I think it's hard. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2087.64s)]
*  I don't think you can rush it. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2089.92s)]
*  I don't think I think it happens later because something comes loose. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2091.68s)]
*  It just does. It's nothing you can figure out. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2095.72s)]
*  It's nothing where you can go, oh, I mean, you think about it once. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2098.52s)]
*  And also, you spend a lot of life avoiding it. Right. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2102.12s)]
*  So like my when I was a young dad and so I just pushed my dad away. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2104.3599999999997s)]
*  I just didn't want to think about it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2108.16s)]
*  So I just decided he doesn't matter anymore for years. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2110.2s)]
*  And like when I was little, I remember he was spanking me once, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2113.6s)]
*  which is now to me, a really odd thing is a man's hand spanked [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2117.28s)]
*  that fucking bare ass of a child, a little bony. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2121.08s)]
*  I can't fathom it now. Yeah. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2124.84s)]
*  Put pants on that kid. Yeah. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2127.08s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2129.64s)]
*  It's really gay and weird and upsetting. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2130.7200000000003s)]
*  But I remember being spanked so fucking hard. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2134.2400000000002s)]
*  Like it was it was like blackout spanked, like I can't handle this. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2138.48s)]
*  And I remember thinking to myself, I think I was about nine. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2141.84s)]
*  I thought the day I get a wallet, like that was the magical thing. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2145.84s)]
*  The day I get a wallet with that money in it and cards [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2150.2400000000002s)]
*  and that set of keys, the second I have that, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  I ain't never going to look at this person again in my life. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2158.48s)]
*  I'm getting away from this guy soon as I have those. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2161.92s)]
*  That's all you need. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2165.6800000000003s)]
*  So you had a lot. You were really you were really. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2167.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I really didn't like being around him. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2170.1200000000003s)]
*  And my mother divorced him when they were when I was 10. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2171.88s)]
*  So then I had a lot of years just with mom where he was around [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2174.32s)]
*  and he would ask for attention sometimes. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2178.1600000000003s)]
*  And I didn't I wasn't afraid of him anymore. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2180.0s)]
*  But I but he made me uncomfortable. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2182.96s)]
*  I didn't like being around. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2184.52s)]
*  There's a lot of good things about my dad and I owe him a lot. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2186.32s)]
*  Yeah, totally. You know, and he created you. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2190.36s)]
*  He did. And he also devoted a lot of life to, you know, he was Mexican. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2192.52s)]
*  And he is our family in Mexico. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2197.7200000000003s)]
*  They do OK. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2199.84s)]
*  And they have some influence and they have, you know, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2201.32s)]
*  he had a better life there, but he moved to America. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2203.88s)]
*  It's sort of the opposite of most immigrants that he went from Mexico, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2206.6s)]
*  where he was pretty well established to America, where he had no tools [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2210.12s)]
*  to survive and where he didn't get the culture. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2214.0s)]
*  But he did it because my mom was the strong one in the family. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2216.6s)]
*  My mom worked really hard and she she raised us and supported us. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2219.08s)]
*  So so he is picking my mom instead of somebody in Mexico. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2223.44s)]
*  And that's how I got to be in the land of opportunity. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2227.88s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2231.7200000000003s)]
*  It's interesting, man, how a lot of times it's our [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2233.12s)]
*  of a previous generation had to kind of take an L and had to like really. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2236.52s)]
*  That's right. So you could have it. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2240.2s)]
*  You know, it's hard to imagine. Imagine that in your own life. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2242.2s)]
*  I'm going to do something shitty. Yeah. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2245.08s)]
*  Well, I'm a move to Toledo, so my son. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2247.24s)]
*  No, fuck you, kid. Good luck. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2249.36s)]
*  I'm going to do something. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2252.44s)]
*  I'm going to go to Vegas and just keep trying to win. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2253.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'd rather sell my ass on the Internet. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2255.72s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck that. Take my chances. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2257.8s)]
*  But I then I so I went through years of like not wanting to think about him. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2259.96s)]
*  And then I once in a while, they would check in with him [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2264.36s)]
*  and see maybe we have something and he'd feel the same. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2266.4s)]
*  And I got to want and he didn't even seem interested sometimes. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2269.4s)]
*  And that was shitty. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2272.04s)]
*  But then and my mom, meanwhile, took care of him. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2273.28s)]
*  She after they divorced, she kept because he was kind of a mess. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2276.84s)]
*  And I learned from that from watching my mom all the way to the end. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2280.44s)]
*  You know, my mom, when she was dying, she provided for him and stuff. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2283.76s)]
*  And I learned about her from that. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2286.84s)]
*  And I asked her about it because because she had no reason to be with the guy [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2288.56s)]
*  anymore. They had been divorced since I was 10. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2292.7999999999997s)]
*  And now, you know, this is a few years ago. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2294.72s)]
*  And she said, I want to send a message to him with she was leaving him some money. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2296.92s)]
*  She said that he's I want to send him a message that he's not alone in the world. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2302.08s)]
*  Now that I'm gone, somebody gives a shit about him. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2306.12s)]
*  And because that's a that's a promise she made him when she married him. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2310.32s)]
*  And even though they divorced, she's she's still honored that promise, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2314.7599999999998s)]
*  even though he didn't stay to his side or whatever. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2318.04s)]
*  And so that helped me like I was a that was a [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2321.36s)]
*  that was a role model for me, my mom later in life. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2325.24s)]
*  And then after she died, I was about to say left my [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2329.4s)]
*  after she'd left after she'd left me by ceasing to breathe. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2334.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. Yeah, guys probably think that. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2339.8s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck you, mom. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2342.2s)]
*  I needed you, bitch. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2343.92s)]
*  After she died, my sister and I who were were at her [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2346.08s)]
*  a memorial that we had for her and he came and neither of us had seen him [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2351.2799999999997s)]
*  for a long time. And we were talking, we were standing in a room talking about [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2354.4s)]
*  we we should where we're going to put him so we don't have to be near him. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2357.64s)]
*  And then he walked up with a cane and we're both like, fuck, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2362.48s)]
*  come here. And we sat with him. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2366.6s)]
*  And then we had this interesting affection for him because mom is gone. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2368.12s)]
*  She would have wanted us to be good to him. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2371.68s)]
*  And he was so weak. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2373.88s)]
*  And he was so and I just felt bad for him. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2376.2000000000003s)]
*  And I felt a tenderness for him. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2380.04s)]
*  So I go to see him once in a while in this place where he lives. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2381.88s)]
*  And the last time I saw him, I just let I let go of everything. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2384.88s)]
*  It just all went away. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2387.44s)]
*  And now I just feel this tenderness. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2389.0s)]
*  I just feel so sorry. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2390.6400000000003s)]
*  Sorry for the guy. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2392.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm all this left, all anger and guilt, all those bad feelings. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2394.32s)]
*  They burn away with time. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2399.28s)]
*  They all burn away completely. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2401.04s)]
*  And so I'm just left with who's I sort of fascinated by him now. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2403.88s)]
*  I look at when he taught he struggles to talk and I look at his face [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2407.36s)]
*  and watch it struggle, you know, and I feel I feel for him. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2411.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, anyway, long answer. Sorry. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2415.32s)]
*  No, but it's kind of a beautiful answer. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2417.76s)]
*  It's about how life is, you know. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2419.12s)]
*  It's like it's funny when you go back to see like kind of the dragon, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2421.12s)]
*  whatever the dragon is, and time has affected it and it's changed. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2424.0s)]
*  And yeah, it's all time. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2427.88s)]
*  It's going to be for your listeners that are struggle with it. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2428.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like you can't rush it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2431.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's OK if you have blocks and stuff. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2432.76s)]
*  You'll you'll mean you can trust yourself a little bit. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2436.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? You'll get there. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2439.2000000000003s)]
*  You'll get there when it's time. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2440.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think I have I had a lot of like I was ashamed of my dad a lot, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2442.4s)]
*  I think because of his age. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2447.0s)]
*  And so I think I had for a while, I had some issues with that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2447.92s)]
*  But even over time, that kind of went away. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2450.84s)]
*  You notice how I would kind of like probably look at him [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2453.2400000000002s)]
*  or I would introduce him to people as my grandfather, just little things that it's like, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2456.4s)]
*  you know, I start to think, well, I wonder how that affected him or [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2460.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2464.6000000000004s)]

*  I just love all that kind of stuff, like how people relate to one another [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2466.84s)]
*  and and especially from our parents growing up. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2470.7200000000003s)]

*  Oh, and that was one of the first place he would take me there with him. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2603.36s)]
*  And I was like 11 or 12. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2606.68s)]
*  He even let me drive him because he was fucking like, you know, at that point, he's 82. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2607.72s)]

*  And then I would stand on the table [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2619.7599999999998s)]
*  and like bark at people to come over and get the credit card thing. Yeah. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2621.04s)]
*  And I think maybe that's where some of like my first semblance of [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2624.12s)]
*  like getting on stage or saying stuff or whatever kind of came from. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2627.6s)]
*  But yeah, that kind of stuff, man. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2633.24s)]

*  You know, I wouldn't have traded my dad for other dads. I wouldn't have. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2656.12s)]

*  But now I realize, wow, this was all part of the plan. That's right. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2680.48s)]

*  You couldn't come. That was. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2717.12s)]
*  That's right. I remember that the cinemax and that stuff that I remember. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2718.72s)]
*  Home box office. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2723.0s)]
*  HBO is the first thing. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2724.2799999999997s)]
*  And I mean, I don't know how old are you again? I'm 42. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2726.12s)]

*  And I remember first there was just television. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2731.12s)]
*  I don't know. You probably don't go back that far. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2733.84s)]
*  It was just terrestrial. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2736.0s)]
*  I mean, there was just the antennas, antennas. Yeah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2737.44s)]
*  And no TV got really good reception. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2740.7599999999998s)]
*  No TV on the in the world. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2744.0s)]
*  Really? Got a reliable picture. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2746.08s)]
*  I mean, that's the way I remember it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2748.64s)]
*  It was just always maybe some rich people, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2749.6s)]
*  but you're still beholden to weather, you know, phones didn't sound so good. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2752.7999999999997s)]
*  Like everything was a little wonky and [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2756.92s)]
*  the channels were, you know, whatever different cities. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2761.08s)]
*  It was usually like two, four, five. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2765.56s)]
*  And so it was like ABC, CBS and NBC. Right. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2767.6s)]
*  And then Fox came along and it was like, that's interesting. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2771.24s)]
*  And then you have this UHF channels, which was this other dial. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2774.2s)]
*  You'd put the your your dial that is seven numbers on you. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2778.6s)]
*  And UHF had like 50 channels that were a different frequency. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2782.88s)]
*  And those were local stations that had like like movie. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2787.24s)]
*  Like a lot of them showed the local sports would be there. Right. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2791.04s)]
*  In Boston, it was Channel 38 was the Red Sox. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2794.72s)]
*  And then they had movie loft where they'd show old movies. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2797.48s)]
*  So that's where you can see stuff like that [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2800.56s)]
*  with thousands of commercials and stuff. Right. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2802.48s)]
*  But then HBO came along and it was a box that you put on top of your television. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2805.2s)]
*  Oh, that's why they call it home box office. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2810.36s)]
*  Yes. Home box office. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2812.08s)]
*  And also the idea of like a box office, like you're going to a movie. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2813.28s)]
*  And and it had an antenna, I think. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2817.32s)]
*  And it had it, but it's scrambled. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2819.96s)]
*  And it brought in a HBO is a scrambled channel. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2822.04s)]
*  And this thing was the decoder. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2825.16s)]
*  I think it was still by antenna at first. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2826.96s)]
*  And they had like dirty movies, violent movies. Wow. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2830.04s)]
*  Standup comedy with cursing. Yeah. And boxing. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2835.7999999999997s)]
*  And it was fucking incredible. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2839.6s)]
*  And then another company called Star Case came along and they were competitors. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2842.2799999999997s)]
*  But they both and then they then they had a cable that it was like, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2845.52s)]
*  we'll bring it to you in a cable. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2848.2s)]
*  And then cable TV was like everything coming in on this crazy cable. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2850.2s)]
*  Hundreds of channels and all that stuff all at once. But [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2853.9599999999996s)]
*  but that was that thing that HBO did was like, you know, you could see anything here. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2857.36s)]
*  That changed the game. Yeah. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2861.84s)]
*  Because otherwise you wait till the movie comes through town. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2863.08s)]
*  Right. There wasn't, you know, and around then then VCR started up [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2865.44s)]
*  and then you could get it, you know, those cassettes. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2869.04s)]
*  And yeah, we had VHS is our. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2872.04s)]
*  I remember we had to ride our bike to go get it. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2874.0s)]
*  And they had that porn room. Remember the room? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2877.04s)]
*  Sure. I worked at a video store. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2879.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, you did. When I was a kid, when I was in high school. Wow. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2880.92s)]

*  too quickly exposed, like, I mean, we had a porn room. Oh. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2886.56s)]
*  And I would run with the guy that run the on the store was just [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2890.0s)]

*  Like he made me run the store. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2894.12s)]
*  I so yeah, after I would wait, I would like to look at the clock waiting for it. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2895.92s)]
*  Like I just wanted to close so I could go in the back room [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2900.0s)]
*  and his office and just fucking just jizz everywhere. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=2904.92s)]

*  Yeah, people would go into the woods. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3043.6000000000004s)]
*  It's almost like, you know, you'd bring it back to nature. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3045.0s)]
*  I mean, my dad, I remember caught us jerking off one time [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3049.44s)]
*  and made us bury it in the yard, bury the semen in the yard. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3051.84s)]
*  To make it like. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3054.36s)]
*  Respectful or something. Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3057.36s)]

*  How did he cut? Wait, first, you said he caught us jerking off. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3061.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess it was there was a it was just me, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3064.7200000000003s)]
*  but I say I don't feel alone, I think. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3069.96s)]
*  I do that a lot. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3073.56s)]
*  Sure. That makes sense. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3074.7200000000003s)]
*  But so he walked in and you would you would just come on yourself. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3075.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, my mother caught me. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3079.56s)]
*  And then she so she went to him and said he's been jerking off. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3081.2799999999997s)]
*  She told him, yeah, she would always kind of rat me out about stuff like that. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3084.16s)]
*  Yeah. But was the jizz doesn't stay like how did he know? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3086.7599999999998s)]
*  But he just said, wherever this is, you need to take it and put it in the yard. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3089.16s)]
*  And that was it. So you just kind of went like that. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3092.7599999999998s)]
*  And it was on a sheet. Oh, it was on a sheet. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3095.56s)]
*  OK, so the thing you came on had to be buried. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3098.16s)]
*  But I would kind of it maybe created respect for him, I think, like as a [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3101.7599999999998s)]
*  and it gave me a kind of an a fair bit of respect for him. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3105.16s)]
*  Kind of an affinity for nature. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3109.3599999999997s)]
*  Sure. You fucked nature in a sense. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3113.48s)]
*  Oh, do you remember my buddy would come over and we would just fucking mount [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3117.08s)]
*  our pillows in the different corners of the room? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3119.96s)]
*  Yeah. The one you have teenage or preteen boys when they start preteen. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3122.72s)]
*  Yeah, there is there is like camaraderie in that stuff. Yeah. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3126.48s)]
*  I had a friend who used to we used to tell each other stories about girls. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3130.3599999999997s)]
*  Like I sleep over his house and he'd sleep on his bed. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3133.92s)]
*  I'd sleep on the floor and we called it telling each other juicers. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3137.28s)]
*  That's what we called it. Juicer. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3141.0400000000004s)]
*  So like he would tell me he'd say, you know, pick a girl and I'd say, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3142.8s)]
*  you know, Gretchen and he'd say, OK, so you and Gretchen [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3147.2000000000003s)]
*  are in school and, you know, you're like you decide to walk home together. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3151.48s)]
*  You go to her house and he just walked me through this story. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3155.2000000000003s)]
*  For good. And then I do it for him with whatever girl he wanted. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3159.28s)]
*  Oh, I can't even imagine you all did that for each other. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we did. It was. Yeah. And I don't think that's awesome. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3166.28s)]

*  I think it was just about squeezing it and getting this like getting this feeling [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3173.0400000000004s)]
*  and just listening to what he's saying and just it didn't occur to us that. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3177.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about girls. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3181.28s)]
*  We didn't feel weird about it. We we were good friends, you know. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3183.0s)]
*  I liked him. He was a good kid. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3186.7200000000003s)]
*  Sounds like it. Yeah. He was, you know, it's something you do for a buddy. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3188.6000000000004s)]
*  Dude, if I laid on a bunk bed right now and another man laid on the floor [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3192.1200000000003s)]

*  It's so much more real than having to just jerk off to something you see on a screen. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3200.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's no good. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3204.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that's one of the things that I miss. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3205.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I think, dude, I remember when I first got an erection, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3207.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought it was poop coming out of the. Whoa. Front. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3210.96s)]

*  And and I told this teacher and. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3218.16s)]
*  Then I think the teacher might have been like a gay man. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3223.28s)]
*  And so then I got this totally weird reaction from him. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3226.44s)]
*  But I remember thinking that poop was coming out of my. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3230.8s)]

*  We only we had we rented the bottom half of a house. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3464.48s)]

*  it was hard to hide it because I was just in my room and whatever stuff was going on. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3476.08s)]
*  And they all kind of became aware of it. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3481.28s)]

*  You know, right. Like she I had Playboys hidden, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3500.56s)]
*  like hidden as hard as I could hide them. Oh, yeah. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3504.24s)]

*  But I was a boy, so sometimes I would just jerk off and then just leave the room. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3510.52s)]
*  And so one day I came home and my mom had cleaned my room [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3514.8799999999997s)]
*  and she stacked my Playboys for me, like stacked them nicely. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3517.72s)]
*  And I was it was just an acknowledgment [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3522.72s)]
*  of my sexuality that I did not I was not OK with. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3526.0s)]

*  We don't we it really is. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3537.52s)]
*  It's yours. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3540.04s)]
*  And it's like kind of the only thing that you especially like an American culture, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3541.8s)]
*  you know, it's very hidden. It's like. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3546.08s)]
*  I don't know, it's the only thing that I had like I remember. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3549.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3553.4s)]
*  Some whatever you're saying, it kind of makes me feel something. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3554.72s)]
*  It's like that's my thing. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3557.24s)]
*  I think I felt a lot in the world like I didn't have a [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3559.84s)]
*  like everything else was up to someone else. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3562.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. Like the environment I was put into, the family I had to live with, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3565.8799999999997s)]
*  the financial circumstance, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3570.64s)]
*  the, you know, pedophiles or whatever in our area, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3574.3999999999996s)]
*  all of that shit was somebody else is doing, you know. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3577.3199999999997s)]
*  But this thing that's mine, it's mine. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3580.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's a very profound thing you're saying. It's very true. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3583.68s)]
*  And so I think because I've always had a tough time with [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3586.7999999999997s)]
*  like sexual connection, you know, like like in my 20s, I couldn't even like [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3590.2000000000003s)]
*  I had like so much sexual anxiety in my 20s. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3595.08s)]
*  It was like hard to even engage, you know. So it was like. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3597.32s)]
*  But man, yeah, it's just interesting to hear that kind of stuff. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3602.08s)]
*  Yeah, because then you have you take this, you discover this thing [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3604.4s)]
*  and it is yours in a wilderness, in a world like you're saying. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  I think it's like that for any kid that age. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3610.36s)]
*  And then you have this weird task of taking that into the world [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3613.84s)]
*  and offering it to somebody else. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3617.52s)]
*  Right. And bringing it to their mind and combining it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3619.0s)]
*  And that's very scary. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3623.96s)]
*  And everybody has a hard time with that, I think. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3626.2s)]
*  I think that's fundamentally why people have like societally [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3628.28s)]
*  societally issues with sex and why there's always sexual [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3631.16s)]
*  puritanicalism comes from one place or another. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3635.76s)]
*  Yeah. Is because everyone has is just not sure how to handle that thing [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3638.56s)]
*  because it's so tender. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3643.32s)]
*  It's like a very. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3644.8s)]
*  Like I did once, and it's not something I talk about a lot [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3647.16s)]
*  because it's very private for me, but I did [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3649.7999999999997s)]
*  the psychedelic drug like therapy once, you know, like treatment with. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3654.3199999999997s)]
*  Like ketamine? No, it was MDMA. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3658.6s)]
*  And I did with mushrooms, too, but I put on, you know, a blindfold. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3661.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's not like Molly where you're at a party or something. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3665.8399999999997s)]
*  But I went in deep and I saw this version of my sexuality, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3668.3999999999996s)]
*  which was like I saw myself as this baby like floating in space. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3673.48s)]
*  Kind of like with nothing around. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3677.12s)]
*  And then not directly from the dick part, but kind of like the umbilical cord, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3679.12s)]
*  like somewhere in between was this like purple like cord. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3683.72s)]
*  And I saw it as kind of like a lifeline, but also an outgoing thing, you know? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3689.08s)]
*  And I saw it as like incredibly fragile. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3694.6s)]
*  And like if you could have taken a bow from a violin and and rung on it, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3699.04s)]
*  it would have like made a crazy like, you know, this sorrowful sound. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3704.16s)]
*  Like it was just like and I saw it as like this deep want. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3709.04s)]
*  But also something ancient about it, like to be I thought. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3714.8s)]
*  And the thought I had in my head was you need to respect that [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3718.12s)]
*  and you need to pay it like at the same time. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3722.84s)]
*  It helped me a lot to look at it that way and to see it as something that [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3727.04s)]
*  just be careful with that. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3730.44s)]
*  It comes from a very deep longing, but also a weird wisdom. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3731.68s)]
*  Like there's so much shit mixed in that. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3736.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And it's so like you passed out the first time that you encountered it. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3738.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like it's just so much. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3743.64s)]
*  And you're given it as a boy, as a fucking boy. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3746.16s)]
*  You're going here it is. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3749.2s)]
*  Here's the craziest thing in the world. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3750.44s)]
*  And it's yours now. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3752.3999999999996s)]
*  But it is it's it's yours. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3753.8799999999997s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, to take that. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3756.08s)]
*  And and and and combine it with somebody else and say, I want to share this with you. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3758.4s)]
*  That is big stuff, man. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3764.64s)]
*  And most people where they wear a lot of armor when they do it. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3766.4s)]
*  Yeah, they wear a lot of armor. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3769.44s)]
*  They would do a lot of they become somebody else kind of people sexually a little bit. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3771.08s)]
*  Or you you play a role or you do something to to to come at it in a way that you know, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3775.04s)]
*  you're going to survive it and be OK and be you know what I mean, but satisfy it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3780.88s)]
*  It's it's it's untangible. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3784.2400000000002s)]
*  Untangible. It's a fucking mess for everybody. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3786.4s)]
*  Wow, it is. It is untangible. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3789.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I had I had a girl just kind of break up with me. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3792.52s)]
*  Reese, I just started kind of dating and we just kind of started and she fucking shut it down. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3794.84s)]

*  I I remember being like [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3802.96s)]
*  the part that kind of upset me the most was I told her that I liked her. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3806.44s)]
*  And it was like it was just so much risk in that for me. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3810.6s)]
*  Like, yeah, admitting that I. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3814.0s)]
*  Yeah, for some reason, it was just so much vulnerability around that. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3817.8s)]
*  Like, I'm going to say. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3821.6s)]
*  I like you because I was afraid that the truth would be that she didn't like me. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3824.04s)]

*  And he's got a little stick on his head with a glowing thing on it. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=3997.76s)]

*  But that's actually the woman. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4008.1600000000003s)]
*  So what happens is crazy. What's fascinating. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4009.2000000000003s)]
*  I just saw this the other night on a show. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4011.44s)]
*  That fish floats around with that thing on her head. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4013.08s)]
*  And the dude is really small. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4017.84s)]
*  The dude is like the size of like her jaw. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4020.56s)]
*  And the dude sees that and also gets the smell. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4023.88s)]
*  She puts a smell in the water and he follows her and he sees the light. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4027.16s)]
*  And these folks live in total darkness. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4031.04s)]
*  They're in that they can't see that they're so below the surface. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4034.24s)]
*  There's no light. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4036.88s)]
*  And they're still coming down there. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4037.88s)]
*  They're still down there having a fight. Yeah. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4039.08s)]
*  So so she she floats around just like this with those fucked up eyes in the dark. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4041.2799999999997s)]
*  And this dude sees when he sees that glow, like he's in darkness. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4046.8399999999997s)]
*  And then he sees that glow and he's like pussy, pussy. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4050.4799999999996s)]
*  And it's the odds are so low for him, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4053.7999999999997s)]
*  because if he's not a fucking great swimmer, he sees the glow. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4056.9199999999996s)]
*  But then he watches it fade and he's fucked and he dies. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4061.04s)]
*  But the best of the anglerfish is how they select. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4064.8399999999997s)]
*  He can get to it and he smells. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4068.3199999999997s)]
*  He he uses the smell and the light. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4070.24s)]
*  And then he latches himself. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4072.8799999999997s)]
*  He's got teeth that latch under her belly. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4074.52s)]
*  And he keeps biting and biting. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4078.6s)]
*  And she fights him because she only wants the best. Yes. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4080.2s)]
*  Exactly like Marv Albert biting that ass. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4083.6s)]
*  He didn't know what he really was, you know. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4086.4799999999996s)]
*  And then he finally latches on. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4088.64s)]
*  And then his face becomes part of her belly and they fuse. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4091.0s)]
*  What? And then he's fused to her by the mouth for the rest of his life. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4095.12s)]
*  And where's this happening in Vegas? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4100.24s)]
*  I mean, for you could get anything in Vegas. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4103.08s)]
*  No, that's what then her bloodstream is feeding him. No. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4105.08s)]
*  And she she eats. She does life. And it goes into him. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4108.36s)]
*  And he just laid he just sits there and comes. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4111.48s)]
*  He just constantly comes out of his mouth into her belly and gets food back. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4113.96s)]
*  And he's done. He's like, I don't need a fucking thing. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4119.16s)]
*  This is, yeah, like the ultimate fucking that kind of guy [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4122.44s)]
*  who finds a woman and latches, he just latches on. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4125.32s)]
*  And they need that lifelong connection because it's so hard to find each other. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4128.839999999999s)]
*  Because of the darkness. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4132.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So she can't because she can't keep looking for new guys. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4133.879999999999s)]
*  So this is it for them. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4136.2s)]
*  God, dude. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4138.08s)]

*  It's kind of weird, right? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4141.48s)]
*  But it's that glow. So I don't know. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4142.799999999999s)]

*  I know it's not very long at all. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4319.68s)]
*  Does it feel is that true when you say that? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4321.44s)]
*  That's a really short amount of time. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4323.72s)]

*  Yeah, I'm starting to feel like that. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4327.76s)]
*  I realize that I need to get out like I love telling stories. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4328.76s)]
*  So I love telling stories and and like Jerry Clower is like my favorite comedian. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4331.84s)]
*  I'm familiar with him, but he was like he's one of the best selling comedians [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4336.400000000001s)]
*  ever, like of like albums and stuff. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4339.8s)]
*  But he was like the Southern. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4342.2s)]
*  He was like this kind of Southern storytelling. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4344.360000000001s)]
*  But I love that kind of stuff. But that's him right there. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4346.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know that face. Yeah. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4349.92s)]

*  This is what I felt like walking out of your show. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4357.84s)]
*  Like are my beliefs intact? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4360.24s)]

*  Like, do you find like is it still the humor that gives you the kick? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4368.92s)]
*  Is it an uncomfortability? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4371.64s)]
*  Is it like a control? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4373.76s)]
*  Do you have any sense of that kind of? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4375.64s)]
*  I think it's a lot of things all at once. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4377.88s)]
*  It's probably why I like it, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4379.96s)]
*  because there's a shitload of things firing at the same time. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4381.68s)]
*  You know, it's a lot. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4384.68s)]
*  And but I'm in control of it. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4386.4s)]
*  And in the ways that I'm not are exciting. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4388.24s)]
*  It's like sailing in a way. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4390.4s)]
*  It's like I know how to do all this stuff, but I'm still, you know, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4391.679999999999s)]

*  OK. On January 20th, and I'm live streaming that show on my website. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4420.0s)]

*  Then I'm taking it down. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4430.12s)]
*  I just want to share that night. Wow. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4431.04s)]

*  I haven't been there in years and I don't want to return that to that. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4435.36s)]
*  I don't want to be an arena comic. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4439.24s)]
*  I don't like the kind of pro circuit thing anymore. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4441.24s)]
*  I just want to do stand up because I love it. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4443.759999999999s)]

*  I'm doing it in the round. I'm standing in the center. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4448.56s)]
*  And so I want to just do that one night so I can really appreciate it for what it is. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4451.16s)]
*  Because when I used to do it a lot, it was like I just take the subway [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4456.320000000001s)]
*  and do the garden. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4458.4800000000005s)]
*  And I and there's a sadness that I didn't see how great that was. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4460.12s)]
*  And now I understand how great it was to have that opportunity. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4463.200000000001s)]
*  So coming back there, calling that special back to the garden. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4467.52s)]
*  And so folks can live stream and watch it during the show. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4471.52s)]
*  And then I'll leave it up for like 10 days just to stream. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4475.92s)]
*  But then it'll come down and go away. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4479.08s)]
*  But what I shot last night is it'll be the same material. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4481.280000000001s)]
*  But that's be my that's the special for this year. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4484.0s)]

*  And that's insane for somebody to say these days, watch anything again. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4496.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4499.64s)]

*  Like that's what Saturday night felt like. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4541.76s)]
*  And everything was just I didn't have to think about anything. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4544.08s)]
*  And it was the the perfect thing for me is when I'm really feeling [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4547.44s)]
*  the things I'm saying 100 percent, I'm not in my head about how's this show going? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4551.719999999999s)]
*  What comes next? How do I say this is the pace good? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4555.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm really thinking like, here's what I feel about Jesus. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4558.28s)]
*  Like, and I really feel it. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4562.0s)]
*  And it was it just was sublime and great. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4564.12s)]
*  And last night was not as easy. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4568.32s)]
*  Like coming off of that was hard. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4571.12s)]
*  That's hard, too, because you can't you can't replicate the you can't [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4573.16s)]
*  cheat your brain to know that you weren't on that. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4576.96s)]
*  No, you can't. That high. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4579.44s)]
*  You can't. And you and you have to. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4580.72s)]
*  I mean, it all comes with experience. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4583.04s)]
*  So some early times in my life, a great show could ruin a bad show [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4584.52s)]
*  because the bad one, I just go, what where are you? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4590.08s)]
*  What happened? But once you know, like to me, it's like the show's [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4592.04s)]
*  going to be as good no matter what. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4594.96s)]
*  I'm going to get the same outcome every single show. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4597.2s)]
*  The difference is going to be how much do I have to work for it? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4599.72s)]
*  You know, how hard? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4602.12s)]
*  So last night it was like, all right, you fucks. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4603.12s)]
*  And I had to really more. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4605.4800000000005s)]
*  I felt like I had to really try harder. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4607.4400000000005s)]
*  And probably when I edit it, the second show [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4610.4400000000005s)]
*  probably be the better show for watching, because it's not fun [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4613.88s)]
*  to watch a comedian be like, hey, man, this is great. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4617.88s)]
*  It's not the comfort of a comedian is not funny. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4621.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's watching the guy test the water to see if it's cold. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4625.28s)]
*  It's not as much the guy sitting in the hot tub. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4627.6s)]
*  That's right. And but the thing, I guess, one of the things I love is going places [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4629.400000000001s)]
*  because there's some places where you know the laughs are. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4634.08s)]
*  There's some places we know everybody laughs at. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4636.16s)]
*  And it's fun to say those things and be good at them and get the laughs [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4638.52s)]
*  that you knew were common. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4642.28s)]
*  But I like taking people places where they they don't even like to think about. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4643.88s)]
*  They don't even like to let alone talk about it or let alone hear about in a show. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4647.12s)]
*  No. But I know what's going to come. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4650.92s)]
*  I know it's going to be OK. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4653.44s)]
*  So I don't I'm OK with it. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4654.96s)]
*  There's great power as a comedian and being OK with uncomfortable feelings, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4657.08s)]
*  with being OK with that. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4662.16s)]
*  You just brought something up and they're like, fuck. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4663.12s)]
*  And then it gets tight in there. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4666.2s)]
*  And I know that that tightness is useful [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4667.599999999999s)]
*  and that there's a place to take that. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4670.599999999999s)]
*  And then when they start to calm down a little bit, they're like, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4672.88s)]
*  I don't even know where I am now. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4675.16s)]
*  This is a weird this. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4676.36s)]
*  You see it in their faces like like I've never laughed at this before. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4677.799999999999s)]
*  And so now I'm in a new place in my mind. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4682.599999999999s)]
*  That's, I think, a very powerful thing about comedy. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4686.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because it's an opportunity to say stuff that's not appropriate. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4688.719999999999s)]
*  That's not all a comedy is on some level of saying something you shouldn't have said. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4691.839999999999s)]
*  It's either you're saying something because it's too private, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4696.28s)]
*  like it's to your oversharing or which people love that you're just going to. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4699.24s)]
*  I'm going to tell you this fucked up. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4704.36s)]
*  You do that a lot. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4705.56s)]
*  Just like I'm going to tell you something really personal. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4706.52s)]
*  Yeah, you need to know. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4708.76s)]
*  So you shouldn't have said that because usually in a real regular [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4709.6s)]
*  conversation or in politics or whatever, you don't say things like that. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4713.64s)]
*  The other you shouldn't have said is because it's so stupid. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4717.0s)]
*  Just a stupid thing. Everybody knows that's not true. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4720.0s)]
*  What are you saying? Yeah. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4723.160000000001s)]
*  The other one is that's fucking crazy. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4724.52s)]
*  That's crazy. That doesn't make any sense. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4726.120000000001s)]
*  These are all different kinds of humor, but they're all based in saying [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4728.64s)]
*  something you shouldn't have said. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4731.76s)]
*  And then the other one is like, man, that's not cool. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4732.4400000000005s)]
*  That's not cool to say that nobody likes that. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4735.44s)]
*  That makes people mad. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4738.72s)]
*  And then there's just like that's wrong. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4740.5199999999995s)]
*  That's that's morally wrong to say that. Yeah. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4742.12s)]
*  And all of those things, if you can take people to those places, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4745.64s)]
*  which are all fear places, fear of intimacy, fear of the insane, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4749.56s)]
*  which is a good interesting kind of fear, you know, fear of the of of truth [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4755.0s)]
*  or fiction, you know, and and fear of of [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4759.88s)]
*  castigation by the by the masses, you know, and fear of morality, of of badness. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4764.44s)]
*  If you can take people to those places and make them laugh, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4770.4s)]
*  make them happy to be that give them a make them feel like this is OK, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4773.599999999999s)]
*  then suddenly they're there safely. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4776.959999999999s)]
*  And that's expanding where you're willing to go with your mind. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4779.08s)]
*  Because these are just this is a cage, you know, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4782.599999999999s)]
*  and it keeps you from seeing life. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4786.0s)]
*  There's so much to life [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4788.12s)]
*  outside of what you're supposed to be thinking about. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4790.28s)]
*  That's a that's a narrow trip, man, you know. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4793.0s)]
*  So either way, the trip life is short. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4795.24s)]
*  Right. If you could do short, narrow or you can do short, broad. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4798.28s)]
*  I mean, it's a little highfalutin, but it's how I feel about it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4801.72s)]
*  No, it's honestly how I feel about doing standup. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4804.68s)]
*  It makes sense here. You say that in watching you. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4808.12s)]
*  And sometimes also, it's just Joe. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4810.6s)]
*  It's just I love the mechanics of jokes. Yeah. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4812.0s)]
*  I love like I just got a new fucking joke. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4814.52s)]
*  Oh, there's nothing better, dude. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4817.44s)]
*  It's literally like pulling something out of your ass [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4819.44s)]
*  and getting ready to smell it. And they like it. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4821.24s)]
*  And they like it. And now you're like, I have this. Yeah. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4822.92s)]
*  I always think it was going healed, you know, like in the old west. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4825.92s)]
*  Like when I once I have a set, like after I put this special out, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4828.48s)]
*  it'll be I'll be I'll be fucking naked again. I have nothing. Yeah. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4832.32s)]
*  But when you go back to the club and start getting [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4836.0s)]
*  then you got to set together and you put the gun belt on like I can go anywhere [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4838.16s)]
*  now, you know, it's just there is there is a power rush to it, I think also. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4841.24s)]
*  And it makes me feel proud of myself. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4846.44s)]
*  Like I used to think [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4847.96s)]
*  for some comedians, it's about love. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4850.12s)]
*  It's about feeling accepted and loved. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4852.0s)]
*  But for me, it's not that really, because I feel weird about that. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4853.639999999999s)]
*  I feel weird when I feel like when people stand up or they show a lot of adulation. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4857.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know what to do. Like, it's not comfortable. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4861.639999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. That doesn't feel human. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4864.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. I can relate to that. Yeah. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4866.679999999999s)]
*  What I feel that's the big thing up there is. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4868.679999999999s)]
*  Like, I'm doing I'm so I'm good at this. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4873.839999999999s)]
*  This is I'm nailing this. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4875.919999999999s)]
*  I'm now making them happy. Everybody's happy. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4877.32s)]
*  The show's good. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4879.5599999999995s)]
*  That's just I mean, that's you're making something good. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4881.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's very satisfying. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4884.2s)]
*  You know, and I get better and better at it. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4885.799999999999s)]
*  I tried something I didn't think would work, you know, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4888.0s)]
*  like when I keep notes in the beginning of when I'm starting to build a set, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4891.28s)]
*  there's always a section that's like long shots, you know, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4895.5599999999995s)]
*  stuff that's never going to have long shots. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4899.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's well, the thing is those long shots, like things that when I first [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4901.799999999999s)]
*  did them, the bottom would feel like, oh, the crowd's like, no. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4905.36s)]
*  And I'm like, this is one this one's going to be hard. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4909.639999999999s)]
*  But every long shot I ever did ended up being the big bits. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4912.16s)]
*  Those end up being the solid killer. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4915.759999999999s)]
*  Never fails. The memorable great bits. Yeah. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4918.5199999999995s)]
*  The bits that I'd start with that were like this is that's a slam dunk. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4922.719999999999s)]
*  That's the stamp. They start fading as the set gets more mature. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4925.679999999999s)]
*  Because you don't love them as much. No. I mean, you like them. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4929.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're whores, but they're not fucking wedding. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4932.32s)]
*  Fucking whores. Yeah. Yeah, you're all right. But yeah, you know, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4934.08s)]
*  come over if I don't get anybody else. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4937.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow, dude. Yeah, I, I can. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4941.48s)]
*  I could totally understand that. I could see how. Yeah, it's about. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4944.72s)]
*  It's interesting that it's not about the affection. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4948.2s)]
*  It's about getting creating something that makes you feel pride in yourself. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4949.92s)]
*  Yes. Pride in yourself. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4955.24s)]
*  I mean, it's a little more self-love than it is love from them. Yeah, I guess. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4956.32s)]
*  But that's OK. That's what we need. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4960.32s)]
*  You know, we're all just trying to like find some way to, you know, to feel OK. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4961.8s)]
*  Yeah, I notice I just started telling more jokes, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4967.6s)]
*  like talking more about Jews and stuff in my set a little bit. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4969.52s)]
*  Like, has that always just been a fray? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4972.08s)]
*  Because in L.A., you can't even say the word it feels like. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4973.2s)]
*  Like you just feel scared. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4975.52s)]
*  But I didn't hear just now when you said it. Yeah. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4976.72s)]
*  I just didn't have any Jewish people by us growing up. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4978.64s)]
*  So to me, it's just like, but my Jewish friends are like, dude, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4980.72s)]
*  this fucking shit is great. It's like. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4983.52s)]
*  But for so long, I was just so scared to even. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4985.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, here's why your Jewish friends like it, because they never hear it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4988.360000000001s)]
*  And the thing is, the best way for people to get to know each other [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4991.08s)]
*  is to hear the voice of somebody who finds they're alienated from a group [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=4995.280000000001s)]
*  and talking about them like. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5000.68s)]
*  Like, I remember years ago, Tracy Morgan, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5003.6s)]
*  and I want to like get him in real trouble, whatever. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5005.88s)]
*  Oh, he'll find a way. Yeah. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5008.4800000000005s)]
*  He did a joke about if his son was gay and he said, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5010.68s)]
*  I'm going to love him if my son is gay. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5016.280000000001s)]
*  I'm going to love him like any father loves any son. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5018.96s)]
*  But if he comes in the room and is like, hey, daddy, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5021.84s)]
*  I'm going to stab that little in the throat. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5024.04s)]
*  Oh, I just caused 70 problems. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5026.08s)]
*  But the bit was so brutal. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5028.96s)]
*  And he got he was like an early version of like, you can't say that. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5031.6s)]
*  And he had to go to like homeless gay centers and listen to people [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5035.4800000000005s)]
*  that were, you know, suffering. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5039.52s)]
*  And he had to go on a big apology tour and they and they shut him down. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5040.72s)]
*  And I thought that was a shame because there's such an opportunity in that. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5045.04s)]
*  He's telling you what it's like to be him where he's from and be. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5048.0s)]
*  And by the way, he's describing a conflict. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5052.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm going to love my son, but I don't know how I'm going to handle him. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5054.96s)]
*  Acting effeminate, right, because my community, my community doesn't honor that. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5058.12s)]
*  And they think that is weakness. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5064.240000000001s)]
*  And yet I'm working and living in Hollywood where he's probably met [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5065.360000000001s)]
*  gay people who he looks up to now. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5069.88s)]
*  So that's why he's got a conflict now. Totally. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5071.8s)]
*  So he the way he dealt with the conflict is with comedy by punching through it. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5073.8s)]
*  With a funny, brutal phrase. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5077.64s)]
*  And there's so much to that. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5080.200000000001s)]
*  There's so much to be learned from that. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5081.88s)]
*  And it'll help people on both sides. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5083.8s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Yeah. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5088.200000000001s)]
*  So it's for it's it's fun to watch people that don't know group talk about that group. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5089.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because that's how you learn. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5095.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's how you see him. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5097.280000000001s)]
*  Huh? Yeah. Yeah, man. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5098.6s)]
*  That's how I see him. I mean, that's where I came. It's exotic. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5099.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's the joy of everything. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5102.72s)]
*  Yes. That's what gives me any fucking excitement in the world. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5105.08s)]
*  Like, I love things like I grew up in a, you know, black, white environment. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5108.24s)]
*  So I love thinking about race and how it interacts and just the surprises. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5111.04s)]
*  And I love that kind of shit. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5115.64s)]
*  It's what even made me want to get people to laugh. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5117.4800000000005s)]
*  Sometimes if you could get black and white people to laugh, it was like [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5119.8s)]
*  you were the best feeling fucking Elizabeth Taylor, dude. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5122.88s)]
*  Like you were doing good. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5125.52s)]
*  No, and you need to eat. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5128.4400000000005s)]
*  You need more of both for it to work. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5129.4400000000005s)]
*  Like if there's one black guy in the room, nobody white will laugh at a race joke. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5131.56s)]
*  Yeah. But if there's 50 black people in the room, they'll they'll laugh. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5136.200000000001s)]
*  And then everybody's laughing. Yeah. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5140.400000000001s)]
*  Because you got to bring 49 other black people yourself. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5142.64s)]
*  You need it for. Yeah. When I worked at a last time, that's not a worthwhile story. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5145.240000000001s)]
*  But at least you know that. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5150.120000000001s)]
*  See, that's the power of that's the power of the experience. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5151.280000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Let's cut bait with that one. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5153.4800000000005s)]
*  That's yeah. But I got to tell you something, because like last night. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5155.92s)]
*  So you know the feeling when you do like, I don't know how [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5158.92s)]
*  what level you work at with stand up, like what's a room you would work around? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5162.96s)]
*  Like, do you do theaters and stuff? Theaters? Yeah. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5167.96s)]
*  So but the comedy store. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5170.28s)]
*  But I mean, yeah, like I'll do a couple thousand seat venue, probably. OK. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5171.32s)]
*  So when you do a big show, that's like a concert, right? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5175.2s)]
*  It leaves me feeling this very dry feeling like there's adrenaline in my system, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5178.400000000001s)]
*  which is uncomfortable. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5183.04s)]
*  But also now I'm like suddenly you're backstage, you're alone. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5184.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's very strange. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5186.96s)]
*  Yeah, they're all couples. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5187.92s)]
*  I mean, some guys travel with an entourage, people that keep them warm. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5189.04s)]
*  I don't do that. Yeah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5192.88s)]
*  So I have opening acts, but everybody's off in couples [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5194.08s)]
*  and groups having fun and you're alone all of a sudden. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5198.24s)]
*  So I'm always left with this fucking and last night I felt it a lot [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5201.28s)]
*  because I had put a lot of pressure on last night's show [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5204.4s)]
*  because I needed to get clean up anything I didn't do right night one. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5207.16s)]
*  And it's for the special. Right. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5209.8s)]
*  So I was cranky and tired and exhausted. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5212.52s)]
*  And I went back to the hotel, I felt like shit. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5215.2s)]
*  And I thought, well, I'm doing this guy's podcast. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5219.0s)]
*  I don't I don't really know your work. Yeah. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5221.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, I know who you are. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5223.36s)]
*  I just automatically respect that you're successful because I know how hard comedy is. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5225.04s)]
*  But I thought, I don't know, I should hear I should hear [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5230.4s)]
*  I should hear his voice, you know, I should hear it. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5233.4s)]
*  So I'm kind of ready for bed. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5235.2s)]
*  I don't want to do anything, but I put my phone on iTunes. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5236.88s)]
*  I found one of your albums. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5239.599999999999s)]
*  It's like a picture of your face as a kid. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5240.92s)]
*  And the fuck is it called? Oh, yeah. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5243.56s)]
*  I want to say what it is, because [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5247.84s)]
*  what is this where Zack can help? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5251.4400000000005s)]
*  This is we tell him, you know, sorry, Musket Fire, Musket Fire. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5252.92s)]
*  So I put on Musket Fire as I'm kind of getting ready for bed. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5258.96s)]
*  And Jesus Christ, I mean, I was I was I was looking for a [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5263.4400000000005s)]
*  something to like, baby, I could pay him a compliment on something. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5268.08s)]
*  I mean, you know what I mean? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5270.08s)]
*  I just want to be respectful and know who he is. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5271.2s)]
*  And I was laughing so fucking hard. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5273.6s)]
*  I was I was just out. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5276.44s)]
*  I don't know how long it's been since a comedian has done that to me. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5278.08s)]
*  I was just laughing my ass off. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5281.24s)]

*  But you're so I mean, I'm just looking at the tracklist so I can remember the bits. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5299.04s)]

*  where the title comes from, where you said about your father being 70. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5306.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And that there you're you were the only sperm. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5309.88s)]
*  Yeah. And that you had to like shut the window. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5313.24s)]
*  You had to close up the nuts. Yeah. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5315.2s)]
*  And then you passed to like a skeleton sperm. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5317.44s)]
*  You had to sweep up and sweep the floors. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5319.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. It was so fucking funny. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5321.4s)]
*  And then this story about Brad Pitt. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5324.4s)]
*  I mean, you have a shitload of weapons. Yeah. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5327.84s)]
*  You have like, you know, like I think of comedians as pitchers sometimes. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5330.4s)]
*  Like some guys have a fastball. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5333.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Some guys are closers, so they just come with heat, you know, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5336.28s)]
*  and other guys have they can protect their fastball with off speed stuff. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5339.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5344.64s)]
*  I mean, you have long stories that you tell that are are that dizzying. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5345.68s)]
*  I don't know how you come up with it. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5351.36s)]
*  It's like an every story has it's like a Christmas tree with so many ornaments. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5352.92s)]
*  Oh, thanks. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5357.88s)]
*  But then also when you're just doing straight ahead observation [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5358.4800000000005s)]
*  about life and sex and whatever, just talking generally, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5362.12s)]
*  which is two two things for comics is speaking about their experience [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5365.16s)]
*  and their feelings and their experiences, one thing. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5369.4800000000005s)]
*  But then the other one is like, here's how I see the world. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5371.4400000000005s)]
*  And you do both with like a fucking it's strong as fuck. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5373.64s)]
*  I mean, thanks, man. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5377.36s)]
*  I listen to then I listen to the other album, the the the hamsters in the bag. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5378.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5382.24s)]
*  And then you called it Louisiana ivory or something like that. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5383.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The ivory of Arkansas. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5387.639999999999s)]
*  Arkansas. Yeah, because they busted a guy with hamster bones in our town. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5389.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You said you figured out it must have been like 2000 hamsters. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5392.92s)]
*  Yeah, something we had to have a lot. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5395.5599999999995s)]
*  And this story where you're in bathing suits with your friend, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5397.719999999999s)]
*  you're wearing wet bathing suits surrounding a bunch of monkeys [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5401.0s)]
*  in a Wendy's parking lot, which is a poem of a sentence. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5404.04s)]
*  Is there any truth to that story that really happened? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5407.44s)]
*  Yeah, that happened in because our town was where. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5409.88s)]
*  Thank you for the compliment. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5412.88s)]
*  That's nice of you. Sure. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5414.360000000001s)]
*  It probably one of the best comments I ever get. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5416.360000000001s)]
*  Well, it was shocking. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5418.08s)]
*  I was like, how do I not? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5419.12s)]
*  How have I never heard this guy? Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5420.72s)]
*  What? Fucking great. Thank you. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5423.04s)]
*  Well, it's crazy how we just don't get, you know, some people [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5425.4400000000005s)]
*  you don't know about people. Yeah. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5428.2s)]
*  You know. Yeah. Well, comedians are single. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5430.2s)]
*  We're not even like tennis players that are one on one. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5432.88s)]
*  We're just one. Right. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5434.84s)]
*  We're like kings on the chessboard, you know, you know, I can't. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5436.64s)]
*  You can't sit on the side by side squares. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5439.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's yeah, that's really interesting. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5442.12s)]
*  You kind of just marvel from afar. Yeah. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5443.68s)]
*  Which I think in a weird way is how I've always connected with people anyway. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5446.4s)]
*  It's just this space. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5450.64s)]
*  There needs to be this space, you know, to have a connection. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5452.64s)]
*  So getting even closer, even more vulnerable, even with comedy and stuff, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5455.72s)]
*  is a thing that's like how that's one thing I'm watching you. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5459.08s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, how what part of this dude is even talk? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5461.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, how is this guy speaking from the bottom of a fucking wishing well of himself? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5465.84s)]
*  Like, where are what? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5472.04s)]
*  Like you're and it's like, I don't even know what part of me is listening to you. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5474.84s)]
*  It's like it's like a fucking violent baby that likes to fuck. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5478.72s)]
*  And and he he's front row and he has no diaper on. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5485.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but he's fucking right there. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5491.84s)]
*  And I'm like, where has he been? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5494.04s)]
*  I didn't know you was in me. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5495.64s)]
*  And then I see couples watching you. Yeah. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5496.88s)]
*  And I'm like, does Louie I almost feel like he marvels at their ride home in the car. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5499.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I do think about that. Yeah, that's what I do. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5503.64s)]
*  How does the what do the groups say to each other? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5506.52s)]
*  What do two guys say to each other? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5509.12s)]
*  You know, because there's that that's hard for people to talk about something like that. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5510.68s)]
*  After, I think they don't want to they don't want to be the first to say [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5514.240000000001s)]
*  they liked it or didn't like it. Yeah. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5517.72s)]
*  So people don't like me in my audience. I can see it. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5519.72s)]
*  Well, I see faces of people going like. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5522.32s)]
*  This is not cool, man. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5525.12s)]
*  And they can't I appreciate that they came. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5526.2s)]
*  Like I used to think like, why the fuck are you here then? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5528.28s)]
*  Well, because you don't if you need to look at a bunch of faces just loving you. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5530.44s)]
*  But it's interesting to look at people that are just like, you know, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5534.599999999999s)]
*  and it's interesting to me that they came because they came to see what goes [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5537.12s)]
*  to something that they don't want to go into a fire, but being like kind of like. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5540.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, people do. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5543.96s)]
*  People like to they want to see they want to see that. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5545.92s)]
*  I think that's different about comedy than music. Wow. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5548.599999999999s)]
*  Music, you're a fan. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5551.44s)]
*  Otherwise, you don't waste your time. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5552.48s)]
*  But when a comedian gets bigger, I think there are people who are like, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5554.2s)]
*  well, I want to find out. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5557.32s)]
*  I don't like him or I haven't. I don't like what I've heard. Yeah. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5558.799999999999s)]
*  But and there's also people that I used to have it more. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5561.839999999999s)]
*  But you see that there's people who just came because you're you're you're a name. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5565.04s)]
*  Right. And they really didn't pay attention. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5569.44s)]
*  And some of those people are horrified. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5571.839999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, at the height of my career, I had people. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5573.839999999999s)]
*  I could see people leave because they're like, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5576.48s)]
*  I didn't know he was going to talk about any of this shit. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5578.2s)]
*  And it was weird because the buildup to it is just only people who loved what I did. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5580.56s)]
*  It's when you get at the first stage of getting notoriety [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5584.64s)]
*  is only devoted fans who love what you do telling their friends. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5589.68s)]
*  Right. That grows exponentially. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5595.0s)]
*  But it's still people they only tell a friend they know will like it. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5597.0s)]
*  So you have just a perfect crowd for a while. Oh, yeah. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5600.76s)]
*  But then if you get more popular, people start coming because they heard about you. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5604.160000000001s)]
*  You start being more accidentally noticed. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5607.88s)]
*  Yeah. People want to yell. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5610.24s)]
*  Sometimes people just want to come and yell. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5611.16s)]
*  So they just want to be in a thing. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5612.5199999999995s)]
*  So you're starting to get more kind of like casual fans and they don't. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5614.16s)]
*  And they're not fun. They're not into it. Yeah. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5617.92s)]
*  And it starts getting you feel the way it starts getting heavy. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5620.16s)]
*  You start getting the whole thing gets a little waterlogged. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5622.2s)]
*  There's I think it happens to every comedian. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5624.96s)]
*  I think there's a couple of a couple of a few years of my [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5626.84s)]
*  career where I felt like I was starting to get a little shitty because I just wasn't. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5630.48s)]
*  I was losing my bearings, you know. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5633.8s)]
*  That's fascinating, man. It really is. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5636.48s)]
*  It's interesting to hear because, yeah, I've had experience where it's like [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5638.24s)]
*  you get so many fans and podcasts and help create that. Yeah. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5640.679999999999s)]
*  And this other alternative world, you know, like because you you had a I mean, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5644.4s)]
*  one thing that you'll be able to say for yourself, I think even as a human, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5649.679999999999s)]
*  by the time you get to the end of your life, is you've gotten to have almost every experience. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5652.84s)]
*  Do you think so? I think so. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5656.96s)]

*  What do you mean? I mean, I don't know about all your experiences, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5660.84s)]
*  but you've gotten to have success. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5662.96s)]
*  You've had success like in the mainstream version. Yes. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5664.599999999999s)]
*  And then this other version. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5667.16s)]
*  And I don't want and I'm paraphrasing myself because I don't know exactly what I'm saying, but [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5668.96s)]
*  this other version of success, like kind of in this alternative [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5674.48s)]
*  in this, you know, do it straight to your fans. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5679.08s)]
*  Yeah. Straight to consumer. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5682.04s)]
*  The movie, the Fourth of July, like, yeah, dude, unbelievable. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5684.32s)]
*  I was sitting there sending Joe List messages like, dude, you are so fucking good. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5687.68s)]
*  He's good, right? Oh, and it just captures who he is. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5691.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, how do we get this special piece of Joe? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5695.88s)]
*  That's like. Yeah. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5700.28s)]
*  Just so like perfect, you know, that was the exercise. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5702.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it was it was awesome. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5705.68s)]
*  It made me in spot. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5710.0s)]
*  It just I can't believe you guys nailed the ability to capture everyone. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5711.36s)]
*  But you've gotten to have and we'll talk about a Fourth of July in a second. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5714.68s)]
*  But you have everything now through your website and you can. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5719.04s)]
*  But what has that been like? [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5722.32s)]
*  Because you had this mainstream success that is very glitzy and glamoury. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5723.36s)]
*  And it's like a lot of us chose podcasting because there wasn't that opportunity there. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5727.24s)]
*  So this alternative universe kind of was created. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5732.04s)]
*  What is what has one been like in the other been like? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5736.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, I had first so many years of just struggling, you know, like [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5739.08s)]
*  I started when I was a just 18. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5743.799999999999s)]
*  I think the first time I ever did it, I was 17. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5747.24s)]
*  But I started really trying at 18 in 1985. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5748.96s)]
*  It was a long fucking time ago, 38 years now. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5752.28s)]
*  But from 1985 and when I was 18 till I was, you know, I was a Boston comedian [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5755.0s)]
*  for years just trying and failing. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5761.04s)]
*  And and and then I moved to New York and I started to get some sense of power. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5763.719999999999s)]
*  But but I tried writing for TV as a way to make a living because I just wasn't [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5767.96s)]
*  making it as a comic. But as a standup, I worked until it wasn't really [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5773.5599999999995s)]
*  till I was like 40 that I started to really like hit. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5778.44s)]
*  So I had all those years. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5781.36s)]
*  So that's like a whole other. Right, right. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5782.8s)]
*  People kind of forget about that. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5784.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, I wasn't trying to discredit you. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5785.52s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5786.96s)]
*  No. But after that, then I had. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5788.6s)]
*  Yeah, I had this big and the biggest part of it was the standup. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5790.88s)]
*  I mean, that's what fueled it all was that I was selling out theaters all of a sudden [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5795.12s)]
*  and they couldn't be big enough. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5799.0s)]
*  Like I would double the size and sell it out. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5800.8s)]
*  I would put a show on sale and it would sell out in a minute. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5803.32s)]
*  And and there wasn't a room in the world. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5806.56s)]
*  Like there wasn't an indoor space in the world I couldn't book. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5810.88s)]
*  Like we would me and my agent would talk about where you want to play. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5814.0s)]
*  Like, let's go to London. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5816.6s)]
*  Royal Albert Hall, if you feel like it, Wembley Arena. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5817.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Any place. Stonehenge. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5820.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking Madison Square Garden. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5822.12s)]
*  Weird amphitheaters in Athens. Mr. McGregor's garden. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5824.12s)]
*  Yeah. Anywhere. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5827.64s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5829.52s)]
*  Like I remember I was talked to one point about playing Central Park, you know, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5830.68s)]
*  like Simon and Garfunkel did. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5834.32s)]
*  Like it was crazy. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5836.24s)]
*  And then the TV thing, you know, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5837.88s)]
*  I mean, I had that show and it hit. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5840.6s)]
*  But it wasn't like Friends or something. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5844.04s)]
*  It wasn't like, you know what I mean? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5846.72s)]
*  It wasn't a network show with a huge reach. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5847.68s)]
*  There's still a shit ton of people that never saw it. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5849.92s)]
*  It had pretty low ratings to my show. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5851.8s)]
*  It got a lot of press and awards and stuff and not even as many awards [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5854.08s)]
*  as other shows. It wasn't like The Office or something. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5858.160000000001s)]
*  Right. But I loved the work. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5860.360000000001s)]
*  I loved I was getting to do the show exactly the way I wanted. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5862.64s)]
*  So I had a huge fulfillment that way. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5865.84s)]
*  And yeah, it was weird. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5868.04s)]
*  I was getting awards and I was at awards shows and stuff like that. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5869.16s)]
*  And I would meet somebody like Brad Pitt and he'd be like, oh, dude. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5873.639999999999s)]
*  And that kind of strange feelings. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5878.28s)]
*  And I'm sure your ego has to build even if you don't know it. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5880.24s)]
*  The ego. So that's right. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5884.32s)]
*  That's the thing that you that you got to be careful of. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5885.44s)]
*  You don't know what your ego is doing. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5887.5599999999995s)]
*  You're just success is very dangerous because there's no warning signs on it. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5889.08s)]
*  There's nothing cautionary about it in the experience. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5894.04s)]
*  You just believe in it. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5897.76s)]
*  You're just like, this is all happening because I'm good at this and because [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5899.0s)]
*  it's my time and and here we go. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5902.56s)]
*  And anything good that happens, you go, sure, I'll do that, too. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5905.2s)]
*  And you just keep letting it load on and you don't think about like you're seeing [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5908.68s)]
*  the American gangster. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5913.28s)]
*  It's Denzel Washington. Yes. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5915.88s)]
*  There is the that you're watching him quietly build this huge empire. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5918.68s)]
*  And then it's when he goes out in the white fur coat to the fight, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5922.72s)]
*  he goes to a boxing match in a white fur coat. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5927.56s)]
*  And then the head cop, the Russell Crowe, goes, who's that guy? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5929.68s)]
*  And he's not aware that somebody has just gone, wait a minute, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5934.28s)]
*  who's the guy in the white fur? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5938.52s)]
*  So when you're like big, getting bigger and bigger, somebody out there is going, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5940.28s)]
*  like, what's going on with that guy? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5943.92s)]
*  That guy is flying awfully high. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5945.08s)]
*  And you just don't you're not aware of that. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5946.64s)]
*  You just go, this just keeps being good. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5948.72s)]
*  I'll do next year. I'll do ten shows at the garden. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5950.36s)]
*  I mean, where does that go? Where do you think that's going? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5954.08s)]
*  Like now I look at it like, where do you think that's headed? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5956.44s)]
*  Like it just can't things that expand explode. Right. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5959.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's unsustainable for most artists in the world. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5963.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, every comedian has that's even gotten that big. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5966.24s)]
*  There's been some come back to Earth moment. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5969.28s)]
*  Every but everybody who gets that big, right, has whatever their vulnerability [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5971.4s)]
*  is, whatever their thing is, their Achilles heel. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5976.599999999999s)]
*  It's going to get hit. Yeah. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5979.12s)]
*  Because the world tests you. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5980.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's also just more interesting to watch somebody go down. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5981.759999999999s)]
*  It's just part of life. Life is a zero sum game, you know? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5984.52s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5987.52s)]
*  But so, yeah, but having done stuff like hosting Saturday Night Live, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5988.4400000000005s)]
*  like a bunch of times like that was never that wasn't in my. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5992.4400000000005s)]
*  In my sights, like I didn't think these things would happen to me. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=5998.280000000001s)]
*  I had completely given up. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6001.320000000001s)]
*  I completely had given up on those things happening to me. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6003.76s)]
*  And just admitted to being a writer, you think? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6006.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I'd never stop doing stand up. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6008.240000000001s)]
*  I thought because I love it. It's the thing I love. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6010.84s)]
*  But I can write. I'm a good writer. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6014.0s)]
*  I tried making films early and they crashed and burned. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6016.04s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm not going to be a film director either. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6019.4s)]
*  Those are the big dreams, like direct movies, be a comedian. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6021.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm going to do comedy, but no one's ever going to love it. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6024.76s)]
*  And I'll go down for whatever I was maybe pulling in a few hundred people a night [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6029.04s)]
*  down and it'll just diminish. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6033.84s)]
*  And someday I'll have to give it up and I'll write and that'll be OK. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6035.4s)]
*  I'll make other people famous, make Chris Rock famous, make Conan, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6039.12s)]
*  help other guys get there. And there's joy in that. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6042.2s)]
*  Chris, I love Chris. I love him. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6045.12s)]
*  He was my favorite growing up. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6047.08s)]
*  Yeah. He astonished me when he came back to stand up after rationale [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6048.16s)]
*  and inspired me a lot. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6052.32s)]
*  And he's one of the best friends I've ever had. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6053.56s)]
*  And he was great. He was just my boss. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6056.6s)]
*  I just loved him. He was the greatest guy. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6059.32s)]
*  He used to say, like, you know, I'm not it's not about me. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6061.8s)]
*  We're all because he hired writers that were all really good. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6064.68s)]
*  And he said, we're all the Yankees. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6068.6s)]
*  I'm in the I'm in the cleanup spot, but I'm just the guy who has this one role. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6070.8s)]
*  But you're all you know, you make us feel like we're all part of it. Right. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6075.24s)]
*  So I liked that work, but I had no I had really decided and I started [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6078.16s)]
*  I had a kid and I was like, this is not it's not going to never going to happen for me. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6083.08s)]
*  And then something changed because when I went on stage, I just didn't [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6087.64s)]
*  I didn't care anymore about my career. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6091.04s)]
*  So and I was really cranky and I was starting to really [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6093.76s)]
*  I went through a new cranky phase and I was a tired father. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6096.68s)]
*  And I started talking about that. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6100.84s)]
*  And then things then things changed, you know. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6102.04s)]
*  Did it surprise you? Yeah, really. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6104.719999999999s)]
*  It really shocked me. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6106.639999999999s)]
*  And then when I got this show on FX, the they paid me the minimum. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6107.799999999999s)]
*  I got paid, you know, scale. Yeah. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6112.16s)]
*  And the show had the smallest budget of any show on television. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6114.08s)]
*  But the point was and it was on FX, which was nowhere at the time. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6117.36s)]
*  I mean, they had a few cool shows. Yeah, but people didn't know about it. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6120.679999999999s)]
*  No. So I thought I'm going to do a show and I'm going to love it. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6122.96s)]
*  And it's never going to take off. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6128.04s)]
*  It's just going to be a little show. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6130.0s)]
*  My friend, Laura Keitlinger, had done this show called The Adventures of Jackie [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6131.8s)]
*  Something, and Laura's one of the funniest people I knew. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6136.44s)]
*  And she did a nice season on like AMC. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6138.64s)]
*  And I thought that's what I'm going to do. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6140.88s)]
*  One season of this weird little show. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6142.28s)]
*  And then I'll go back to them. I'll get another writing job. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6145.0s)]
*  That's what I figured. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6146.72s)]
*  I had no fucking and then we're like, you know, then we're getting on the big lists. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6147.8s)]
*  And then we got me. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6151.4s)]
*  I was totally shocked. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6152.96s)]
*  That that happened. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6155.88s)]
*  But then after a few years, I'm like, yeah, this is, you know, it's like [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6158.6s)]
*  if you play blackjack, you start winning. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6161.8s)]
*  You get stupid right away. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6164.52s)]
*  You're like, I'm good. It's because I'm good at blackjack. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6165.8s)]
*  Yeah, because I know what I'm doing. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6167.76s)]
*  And then they just then you're busting every hand. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6170.4800000000005s)]
*  You're like, no, I'm a fucking asshole. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6172.88s)]
*  So, yeah, I was in a place where I thought like I this is happening [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6174.280000000001s)]
*  because I know what I'm doing now and because I'm earning it. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6177.56s)]
*  But a lot of it is just so weird. You caught a wave. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6180.8s)]
*  You caught a wave. It was good timing. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6183.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting how some comedians don't even get the time. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6185.400000000001s)]
*  It's like they're where they're what they're funny is in their lifespan. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6187.76s)]
*  It just doesn't match with the wave of like where society is. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6191.4800000000005s)]
*  Sometimes that's right. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6194.56s)]
*  There's some people that are incredible, but they weren't that at the right time. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6195.360000000001s)]
*  That's one of the biggest challenges in comedy is just staying good [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6199.4800000000005s)]
*  when nobody's paying attention and continuing to progress. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6202.52s)]
*  Because it's like this searchlight that maybe finds you sometimes. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6205.76s)]
*  And if every time it finds you, you're you're getting better and better. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6209.04s)]
*  Then the then someone in the somebody in the world will start to go, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6212.4800000000005s)]
*  this guy is a good bet. They'll start putting money on you. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6216.24s)]
*  Yeah. But but anyway, then when I when I started to pull in [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6218.599999999999s)]
*  that when it became like total, like just nothing fails. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6223.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. On the road, because standup was always the most important thing. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6226.5199999999995s)]
*  I thought an interesting way to leverage this would be [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6231.96s)]
*  to make a connection with the fans through this website, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6236.88s)]
*  because I could have started taking huge checks from big promoter companies. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6241.64s)]
*  You know, just those there are tours where they just give you the money first. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6246.280000000001s)]
*  Right. Right. It's like here's seven million bucks or whatever. Yeah. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6249.68s)]
*  And then we're going to charge your fans six hundred dollars a ticket. Right. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6252.0s)]
*  You know, we're going to sell and then we're going to sell those tickets [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6255.200000000001s)]
*  to our own reseller, you know, to look and we're going to make money that way. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6257.200000000001s)]
*  And we're going to give you they can do stuff like we'll give you a jet. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6260.92s)]
*  Verizon's paying for the jet. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6263.0s)]
*  And now you have a Verizon sign above your, you know, they have [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6264.6s)]
*  you have sponsorships on the tour and then they load on other comedians [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6267.200000000001s)]
*  that they owe money to that they're trying to burn off the money. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6270.84s)]
*  And you're doing rooms that are just off that they own. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6273.6s)]
*  You know, it's just but it's seven million dollars. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6276.68s)]
*  Here you go. That's what you get for your 30 year climb. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6279.04s)]
*  That's what that's, you know. Right. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6282.64s)]
*  But to me, it was more interesting to go because I was interested in like Ticketmaster [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6285.4800000000005s)]
*  has all the emails they know. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6289.84s)]
*  Those are the Glenn Gary leads they have. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6291.96s)]
*  But if I make a website and sell directly to people [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6294.360000000001s)]
*  and I think about how I don't like buying stuff when they ask me for my email, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6297.16s)]
*  I don't like. Yeah, I hate it. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6301.16s)]
*  I don't like belonging to stuff. I don't like joining. Right. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6302.48s)]
*  I don't want to do that to my fans either. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6305.16s)]
*  No. So we just make it that you just pay the five bucks and it's in five dollars [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6306.5199999999995s)]
*  was this like crisp little number and then you have it. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6311.28s)]
*  And I don't care if you fucking share it. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6314.68s)]
*  Don't be a dick and make money on it. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6316.5199999999995s)]
*  But I don't give a shit that much. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6318.32s)]
*  It's never going to it's not going to ruin my life if other people share my products. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6319.84s)]
*  Right. And at the time, this idea of protecting your product was getting bigger. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6323.5199999999995s)]
*  Because digital was new, you know, and and then I got your email. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6327.68s)]
*  And if if you want to give me your email, you have to give it to me. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6333.0s)]
*  Like we made it hard to get to get on the list. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6336.2s)]
*  So I got this little list and started growing. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6339.0s)]
*  And it just that saved my life because that's I still have that list is getting bigger [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6340.76s)]
*  and bigger. But it's that's who I go to now. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6345.12s)]
*  Has that been do you find more? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6349.8s)]
*  Do you miss the notoriety of not even a little bit interesting? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6352.44s)]
*  Not even a slice. True. That's 100 percent true. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6356.799999999999s)]
*  I don't miss it. I don't. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6360.28s)]
*  The thing I just do, I mean, I've been touring for three years. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6362.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. Right. Yeah. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6365.759999999999s)]
*  Here's all over the world and big places. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6366.32s)]
*  A lot of my friends have been working with you on and off over the years. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6368.48s)]
*  And I know that for sure. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6370.719999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I guess I was wondering, do you miss that Hollywood style kind of [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6372.879999999999s)]
*  notoriety? That's the that's the things that that podcast has always missed. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6376.0s)]
*  But they're not like in this. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6379.5199999999995s)]
*  It's so funny to me, too, because like I have a friend like Shane is a buddy of mine. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6380.919999999999s)]
*  Shane, yes. And he's got a you. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6384.24s)]
*  He puts sketches on YouTube and hundreds of thousands of people watch them [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6386.24s)]
*  and people worship Shane and he sells out big places and he's having a great time. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6390.639999999999s)]
*  And he's like, I'll never get on television. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6394.76s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6397.28s)]
*  Like, what is your problem? Yeah. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6400.719999999999s)]
*  It's like a guy who invented the telegraph and he's like, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6402.679999999999s)]
*  they'll never let me on the Pony Express. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6405.44s)]

*  Yeah. And and and but the difference is you got something. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6443.6s)]
*  People are never your fans you have from doing this. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6446.72s)]
*  They're never going to let you go. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6449.4s)]
*  You're going to stay with you. Yeah. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6451.04s)]
*  So it's a blessing. It is. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6452.76s)]
*  And when you can go to direct, it's just I do stand up now and people come [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6454.36s)]
*  and we have a great time and they pay me. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6458.68s)]
*  And what the fuck else could I possibly want? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6461.68s)]
*  These these are people I care about. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6464.64s)]
*  They went out of their homes. I know. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6466.32s)]
*  Fucking got a babysitter and parked somewhere [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6469.08s)]
*  and then sat politely in a fucking seat with strangers [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6472.5599999999995s)]
*  and listened to me and gave me a shit ton of money. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6476.76s)]
*  I mean, when I went back to clubs first, I'm like, I'm in clubs again. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6480.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, that's all it's all I got. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6484.0s)]
*  I thought that might hurt. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6486.92s)]
*  It might that's I didn't know if it would feel like this. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6487.88s)]
*  But when I first was like the St. Louis funny moment, I remember, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6490.64s)]
*  you know, the soda thing is right next to you going [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6494.32s)]
*  like speed and soda to the bar. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6498.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. In a back room with just soda machine. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6500.280000000001s)]
*  That was one of the last ones you could smoke into. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6502.96s)]
*  Yeah, you could. It's still. Oh, you can. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6504.84s)]
*  Good. They had an early smoking show. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6506.320000000001s)]
*  And I was like, here I am. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6508.6s)]
*  But I went on stage in that place. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6511.76s)]
*  You know, the crowd is just all around you and it's hot. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6513.400000000001s)]
*  You feel a heat like you can see kind of like a like steam coming off of them. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6516.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And it's a dump. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6520.24s)]
*  Yeah. You feel like if you just pushed one of the walls hard enough, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6522.360000000001s)]
*  the whole club would fall down. Yeah. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6525.68s)]
*  And and I had a fucking ball. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6528.76s)]
*  I had such a good time. It was hard work. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6531.52s)]
*  I did like two Friday, two Saturday, like the old days. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6533.72s)]
*  And then I got paid and I'm for whatever I am. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6537.56s)]
*  I can still get 80, 90 percent of the door. Yeah. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6540.64s)]
*  And 80, 90 percent of the door of a comedy club after, you know, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6543.76s)]
*  through Saturday. That's crazy money. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6548.400000000001s)]
*  Now playing the garden and then another arena the next night [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6551.72s)]
*  for 20 nights in a row is astronomically more. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6554.68s)]
*  But I don't feel that money. I don't need you. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6558.04s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't feel like more. Right. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6560.12s)]
*  It's just like, yeah, that's a shit ton of money. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6562.6s)]
*  It's all gone now because I'm stupid. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6564.56s)]
*  And I guess I made movies with it. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6567.200000000001s)]
*  I make my own stuff with my own money now. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6568.72s)]
*  But that fucking funny bone check. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6571.320000000001s)]
*  I was like, who needs more than that, man? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6575.320000000001s)]
*  That's and and I'm with comedians I love. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6577.280000000001s)]
*  I'm choosing my openers. We're having fun together. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6580.08s)]
*  And then I called enough money together to make that movie with Joe. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6582.84s)]
*  And we don't get you know, I don't get written about. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6586.6s)]
*  I'm not, you know, when I made two specials over the last years. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6588.96s)]
*  And yet is that hurt? No, it doesn't. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6591.8s)]
*  It really doesn't. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6594.240000000001s)]
*  Because a shit ton of people buy them on the site and folks that want. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6595.240000000001s)]
*  I'm back to that place where if you're watching me, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6599.68s)]
*  it's because you really want to hear these jokes. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6602.400000000001s)]
*  It's not because you want to like, you know, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6605.320000000001s)]
*  see what this means inside the culture or you don't want to. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6608.0s)]
*  You're not trying to clam on to act cool because you like me. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6610.72s)]
*  It's just you're into the comedy. Yeah. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6614.0s)]
*  If you're if you're watching me, you're into the comedy. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6616.4800000000005s)]
*  There's no other reason to do it. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6618.4800000000005s)]
*  And I like that. And I have my friends in the industry and in my community. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6620.4800000000005s)]
*  My I have my real friends. I lost a lot. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6625.200000000001s)]
*  But now I have real friends and I love them and and I love their success. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6627.72s)]
*  Doing that with Joe is a big thing for me because that was his story. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6632.56s)]
*  It was his voice. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6636.68s)]
*  So given a movie to a young guy, you know, who I just thought was worthy, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6638.32s)]
*  somebody should listen to this guy. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6642.84s)]
*  And I don't think anybody else is going to make a movie for him. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6644.24s)]
*  So that felt great. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6647.0s)]
*  And it's a small, small movie. It's got a small scale. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6649.599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's not like some like, whoa, it's just a fucking real story. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6652.16s)]
*  So I got to do that. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6657.4s)]
*  And it's it's inching towards making its money back. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6658.599999999999s)]
*  It's just it's just, you know, it costs a lot because of the pandemic. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6661.48s)]
*  It was expensive to shoot during that time. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6664.96s)]
*  It's expensive to shoot during the pandemic. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6667.16s)]
*  But but no, it's really good. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6669.24s)]
*  It's a and I I don't know. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6671.5599999999995s)]
*  You can you can have a life like that. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6674.2s)]
*  You don't have to take every every opportunity. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6676.24s)]
*  I don't think that the Hollywood notoriety, that membership of that club, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6678.96s)]
*  it's not really good for you. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6683.599999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's cool. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6685.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a fun trip. If you can make the trip, if you can get that big. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6689.32s)]
*  Yeah, go on the trip. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6692.32s)]
*  If you can go on some red carpets. Yeah. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6694.4s)]
*  Have fun. It's a it's worth experiencing. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6697.799999999999s)]
*  If you can host Saturday Night Live, go fucking do it and make the most of it [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6700.759999999999s)]
*  and do your best and try to be yourself. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6704.36s)]
*  Try to it's really everybody that has made it and had a real like [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6705.879999999999s)]
*  like you're saying at the end of life going, I did all this. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6711.16s)]
*  It's could you say yourself during it? [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6713.96s)]
*  Because if you're not yourself, if you change in order to stay in those places, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6716.16s)]
*  because that's the first thing they'll ask you to do. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6720.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's what I tried when I got to Los Angeles. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6721.92s)]
*  Then if you do that, then you're not the one experiencing it anymore. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6725.0s)]
*  You're lost. You just not you. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6727.52s)]
*  You became somebody else to do that. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6730.0s)]
*  And then you start getting this weird feeling about that. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6731.92s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6734.2s)]
*  I was I've been a part of things where it's like, I don't feel like this is me. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6735.12s)]
*  And it's because I wasn't choosing it. It wasn't me choosing it. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6738.96s)]
*  So then, of course, it's not going to be me that shows up to it every day. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6741.92s)]
*  No, that's a fascinating note for anybody. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6745.52s)]
*  And this could be a relationship, a job, anything you're in. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6747.52s)]
*  If you're wondering why something doesn't feel right all the time [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6750.0s)]
*  or doesn't fit or you're not showing up the same way that feels comfortable to you, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6752.64s)]
*  it's because of that very reason right there. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6757.32s)]
*  Yeah, because you kind of desire can come from a lot of things. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6760.72s)]
*  It's not always internal. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6763.64s)]
*  Sometimes it's like I've been told I want this or this feels like this [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6764.84s)]
*  might get me out of where I am. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6768.6s)]
*  This seems like what I should be doing. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6770.12s)]
*  Yes. Or it might be a step that that feels right to me. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6771.52s)]
*  I've seen other people do that. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6774.88s)]
*  Or sometimes it's just like, maybe this will get me out of my misery. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6777.56s)]
*  Maybe this will change everything, that kind of thing. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6781.0s)]
*  But the thing you got to ask yourself is, am I being Theo when I take this step forward? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6783.8s)]
*  Like, what would he do? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6788.88s)]
*  Because and if it looks so good, but you're like, hey, me, man, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6790.72s)]
*  the you say to yourself, yeah, but it's OK, because I'll take that step [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6794.8s)]
*  and then there'll be another me step past that. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6798.8s)]
*  But there's no more you like if you take one step, that's not you. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6801.200000000001s)]
*  You have nowhere to put the next foot. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6805.080000000001s)]
*  The next is not you anyway. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6807.36s)]
*  Like your yard. You're not nowhere. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6808.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you take a step, that's like, this seems like a bad idea. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6810.32s)]
*  This is hard. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6814.92s)]
*  Nobody likes this. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6816.08s)]
*  But it's me, man. What am I going to do? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6818.24s)]
*  Then when you take that step, the great thing is no matter what comes at you, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6820.16s)]
*  all you got to do is lift your foot and plan it again. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6823.5599999999995s)]
*  You still you you can you get you through hard times [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6825.5199999999995s)]
*  and it'll keep you available for good times. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6829.16s)]
*  As yourself, you know, there's nothing there's nothing else. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6832.36s)]
*  There's nothing else. All that stuff. It's. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6836.28s)]
*  It's got a gross side to it. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6839.92s)]
*  But if you're yourself, again, if you can be yourself and you can observe it, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6841.4s)]
*  you can find love there, this love everywhere. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6846.599999999999s)]
*  So you can find friends and you can find interesting things. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6849.44s)]
*  You know, if you're in an award show, there's people working the cameras [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6852.599999999999s)]
*  and stuff and like a lot of them were people I knew from like Conan, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6854.96s)]
*  like crew members. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6858.4s)]
*  So I'd be at an award show going like, I shouldn't be here. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6860.16s)]
*  And then I'd see, you know, a guy like, hey, and I go, hey, there's love there. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6862.28s)]
*  Yeah. Or a weird actor I worked with for some a long time ago. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6866.12s)]
*  And he's you know, there is people there. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6870.04s)]
*  You can find a loving and a self path through anything. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6872.360000000001s)]
*  But if you depend on if you're like, I don't feel good if everybody [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6876.92s)]
*  if I'm not a Hollywood A-lister, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6879.68s)]
*  you might as well fucking pack it in. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6882.52s)]
*  That's it's not a good way to live. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6884.24s)]
*  Yeah, man. It's just it's so interesting to hear some of that, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6887.52s)]
*  because I've had spots even in the past couple of years [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6890.360000000001s)]
*  in my life where I chose to do certain things. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6892.320000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I know this doesn't feel right, but I feel like I need to do it [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6893.88s)]
*  for money or I feel like I need to do it for. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6897.28s)]
*  And once I got out of some of that, everything has fallen so much more [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6899.96s)]
*  into place. I've gotten my semblance of humane. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6904.52s)]
*  Like, I just feel like myself more again. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6906.68s)]
*  It's been pretty fascinating. Good. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6909.24s)]
*  When it comes to like love in your life, has that been a tough thing? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6911.88s)]
*  I find like as a comedian, like I get so analytical about stuff. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6914.72s)]
*  And obviously, we were talking a little bit about how like [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6918.36s)]
*  getting into emotional spaces can be like a real, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6921.280000000001s)]
*  you know, that can be like a real. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6925.400000000001s)]
*  It's a real it can be a tough space sometimes for comedians. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6928.0s)]
*  Yeah. Has it been sometimes I notice even with like being in love [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6930.6s)]
*  or something like that, I'll like I'll be analyzing it so much. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6935.04s)]
*  It's hard for me to actually be in the feelings. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6938.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm like. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6940.72s)]
*  It's like to be in the feelings, almost to let go of some control kind of. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6944.6s)]
*  Yeah, you do. You know. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6947.6s)]
*  And so have you had experiences like that in your life? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6948.96s)]
*  Has it been kind of tough or what's that kind of been like? [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6951.4800000000005s)]
*  Because I know you've you've been married and you've been married. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6953.4s)]
*  Yeah, I've got two kids. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6955.84s)]
*  That's a different kind of love. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6957.56s)]
*  It's that's a forever. It's a love you just have. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6958.8s)]
*  It's like you can't choose that. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6961.16s)]
*  Was that hard for that? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6963.4s)]
*  Because sometimes I fear that like. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6964.2s)]
*  Because love seems so negotiable sometimes, I think, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6966.92s)]
*  because it was like that when I was it felt like that when I was a kid. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6970.16s)]
*  Yeah. That I worry that it's going to be like that if I'm a parent. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6972.68s)]
*  How is it negotiable when you're a kid? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6976.0s)]
*  You mean conditional? [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6977.72s)]
*  You mean like it can go away if you don't do the right thing or something? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6979.240000000001s)]
*  What do you? Yeah. Yeah, I think like if you don't. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6982.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you're not like. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6987.76s)]
*  I don't know if you're not something, then. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6991.6s)]
*  You don't deserve something, you know, or something like that, you know. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=6996.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I have a dog. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7000.6s)]
*  You have a dog. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7002.52s)]
*  Oh, I've got a dog and she's like my wife now, like it's me and her, you know. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7003.280000000001s)]
*  And we I mean, my kids are in my life and we have a great joy. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7007.88s)]
*  But my dog's with me every single day when I'm home. Oh, wow. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7012.88s)]
*  And I was with my dog once and I smoked a little. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7016.04s)]
*  I don't smoke weed very much. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7020.6s)]
*  But I went to Washington Square Park and just bought some weed. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7022.92s)]
*  And it was I think it was a little a little much. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7025.92s)]
*  Yeah, some weed makes people gay. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7028.360000000001s)]
*  And makes gay people even gayer. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7030.56s)]
*  I've never seen that. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7034.96s)]
*  No, but I was I was like. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7035.96s)]
*  Getting existential and weird, you know. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7039.72s)]
*  Yeah. But my dog came over and sat with me, so I just kind of hung on to her. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7041.6s)]
*  And I said to her, you know, you don't have to do anything. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7045.72s)]
*  You don't ever have to do anything. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7049.4800000000005s)]
*  I said, you don't have to worry. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7051.400000000001s)]
*  You don't have to try. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7053.400000000001s)]
*  You don't have to be sorry. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7055.32s)]
*  You don't have to promise. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7057.6s)]
*  You don't have to regret. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7060.72s)]
*  All you got to do is sit there and just take the love that's coming at you. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7061.92s)]
*  That's all you got to do is just be and just take the love that's just coming. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7065.16s)]
*  And then I thought, I can say that to myself, too. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7071.44s)]
*  I said, that's anybody. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7073.4s)]
*  Hmm. You know, I mean, if you're willing to just be yourself and just sit there. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7074.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's hard. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7079.24s)]
*  Sometimes you're just alone. Sometimes you're just lonely. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7080.84s)]
*  Sometimes you don't find somebody you don't find love. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7083.36s)]
*  But once you have kids, it's it's a tricky thing with kids, too, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7086.4s)]
*  because you want to love them. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7089.96s)]
*  And and then you also got to let them go. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7091.2s)]
*  You also got to let them depart your life. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7092.88s)]
*  You got to let them. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7094.8s)]
*  My kids are 18 and 21 now, 17 and 21, about 18, a few months. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7095.88s)]
*  But they they start to, you know, and yet and then it turns to do a different [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7100.52s)]
*  air. Everything that takes away from you gives you get another. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7104.360000000001s)]
*  It's a zero sum game. Yeah. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7107.320000000001s)]
*  So your kids aren't little, you know, holding your hand anymore. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7108.88s)]
*  But you can watch a movie and make fun of a movie together. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7113.400000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7115.84s)]
*  Talk about life and be friends. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7116.72s)]
*  And that's incredible with somebody who you used to wipe her little face, you know, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7119.400000000001s)]
*  and now you're laughing at a fucking shitty movie together [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7124.56s)]
*  and talking about how shitty this movie fucking sucks and cursing together. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7126.96s)]
*  You know, yeah, that's really something. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7130.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I want to curse my fucking kid. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7132.4s)]
*  Yeah. You need to have kids, I think. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7134.36s)]
*  I think you should have kids. Yeah. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7135.8s)]
*  And I don't know. I mean, the that love with with a woman, with a partner, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7137.4400000000005s)]
*  that's a lot harder because you're both armed with self protection and stuff. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7142.12s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7146.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I think the thing you got to be willing to just try it and fail. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7147.4800000000005s)]

*  because it mostly usually doesn't. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7155.080000000001s)]
*  I think it should be OK with people that you combine with somebody [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7156.84s)]
*  and you try and the bunch of stuff doesn't work and you fuck some and you have fun [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7160.360000000001s)]

*  Yeah, it's really every all the comfort you have that you're alive. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7365.36s)]
*  You can just squeeze this little [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7368.96s)]
*  put a little bit of water like this, probably this much water. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7371.24s)]
*  And it's like I'm dying. I'm dying. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7374.72s)]
*  Dude, if I have tuna fish, because a lot of times, if you know, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7377.08s)]
*  when you're coming up, you have to cook in your hotel room in the. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7379.32s)]
*  You know, yeah. Yeah. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7381.4s)]

*  No, just in a star from Cup. OK. And then. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7386.24s)]
*  But if I had Gatorade electrolytes and tuna, my throat would shut down. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7390.48s)]
*  I didn't know. Oh, really? Some crazy reaction. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7393.5599999999995s)]

*  It was the first time that it happened. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7402.2s)]
*  I got really scared and I went up to this. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7403.08s)]
*  Not a maitre d. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7406.92s)]
*  What's the lady that helps clean the room, clean the hotel? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7407.84s)]
*  Definitely not a maitre d. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7409.8s)]
*  Yeah. What is it? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7411.28s)]
*  You mean the maid? Maid. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7411.76s)]
*  Maid. Yeah. Or maid. Yeah. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7412.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7415.12s)]
*  I went up turn on like fucking, you know, trying to do like this, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7416.76s)]
*  you know, in Gatorade, you know, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7421.08s)]
*  tell her what happened. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7423.68s)]
*  Like fish and Gatorade. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7425.32s)]
*  And I remember putting literally putting my fingers in my throat [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7427.08s)]
*  and fucking holding it open enough, suck a breathe like. Wow. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7430.16s)]
*  But it's just when that pipe, it's like the littlest thing. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7433.12s)]
*  Man, oh, man, you're gone. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7435.6s)]
*  That's why waterboarding works. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7436.8s)]
*  All it just you go like this and I like I'll tell you everything. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7438.16s)]
*  Forget it. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7442.08s)]
*  The movie was so great. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7444.96s)]
*  Can I ask you just as a how much does it cost to make a movie like this? [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7446.400000000001s)]
*  And you said it was more during the pandemic. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7450.64s)]
*  Way too much. OK. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7452.2s)]
*  It was like something like two million bucks. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7454.0s)]
*  That movie shouldn't have cost that much. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7456.16s)]
*  But there's two reasons. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7458.0s)]
*  One was the pandemic, because that just it was like 30 percent more. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7459.04s)]
*  Everything costs 30 percent more. Right. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7462.360000000001s)]
*  And then the other thing was that I was coming back to I hadn't filmed anything [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7464.4s)]
*  in a long time and because the pandemic had happened [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7467.839999999999s)]
*  and I just wanted to really enjoy it. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7471.0s)]
*  I wanted to really make a movie and not worry about low, low budget movie. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7472.799999999999s)]
*  Just means you're dragging your balls on the gravel. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7477.24s)]
*  And it's just every single thing you do is hard. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7480.5199999999995s)]
*  And everybody around you is stressed out because nobody's getting paid enough [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7484.12s)]
*  and you're working bad hours and stuff. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7486.679999999999s)]
*  I just didn't want to do it. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7488.679999999999s)]
*  I just wanted to like so we did a comfortable version of it. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7490.24s)]
*  It still was very low budget. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7493.2s)]
*  That's still very low for a feature movie. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7494.4s)]
*  Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. But. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7497.24s)]
*  But and also we shot in this house that that was the heart. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7500.0s)]
*  The biggest expense probably was the house because we had to find [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7503.48s)]
*  I couldn't make the movie unless that house was the exact right kind of law. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7506.72s)]
*  Rumi log cabin had to be on a lake and it had to be in a place that felt like Maine. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7511.28s)]
*  It was actually in upstate New York and Lake George. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7518.0s)]
*  And that was a and a place that's willing to be rented as a house. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7520.4s)]
*  So we the place there's like a list usually of location people [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7523.679999999999s)]
*  that put themselves out there as were available. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7527.04s)]
*  None of them worked. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7529.32s)]
*  So I had to have a guy. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7530.32s)]
*  I the location guy is a guy named Jeff Karen from Louie from my series. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7532.92s)]
*  And I went to him and asked him to do it. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7537.28s)]
*  And he said, I don't do that anymore. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7539.4s)]
*  I'm retired like he is a whole other life. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7540.5599999999995s)]
*  And I just begged him and he came out of retirement just just for me. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7543.04s)]
*  So he because he had to just go real estate listings and go [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7547.2s)]
*  hit the fucking bricks all over like northern America, you know, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7551.72s)]
*  and go to people's doors and knock on them and say, are you willing to be a location? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7555.8s)]
*  That kind of cold calling. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7559.56s)]
*  It was very hard to find the right place. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7561.16s)]
*  And then once we found the place that was willing, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7563.04s)]
*  they could have double the price. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7565.28s)]
*  We still would have paid it because so it cost a lot. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7566.44s)]
*  And then we put Lake George is in this little town where it's really expensive. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7569.24s)]
*  So there's no hotel. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7573.8s)]
*  So we had to find housing. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7575.56s)]
*  We had to find like basically vacation homes for the whole cast and crew. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7576.68s)]
*  And that was the hugest. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7581.04s)]
*  Anyway, it's a long explanation, but it's a lot. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7583.320000000001s)]
*  It's almost goes into all that. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7585.76s)]
*  Yeah. Movie like that should you should be able to make it for under a million bucks. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7587.200000000001s)]
*  It's it's so it's just people talking. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7590.92s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7593.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, we shot in New York City, too, which is expensive. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7594.400000000001s)]
*  So for the first like 30 minutes of the movie. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7596.52s)]
*  But there's a lot of ways. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7600.4400000000005s)]
*  There's so many cameras now that are as good a sensor as any other camera. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7601.4800000000005s)]
*  And the great lenses of the world, you can rent and everything else is rentable. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7606.12s)]
*  And there's people that have film equipment who are dying to use it now [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7609.8s)]
*  because they overbought and and you can usually pull. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7613.08s)]
*  I mean, the unions are strict and you have to use union crews most of the time. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7617.0s)]
*  So if you're really trying to make a movie with like a, you know, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7622.400000000001s)]
*  carpentry department and electrical and and grips and everything. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7625.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to keep the cost down a bit. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7629.360000000001s)]
*  But if you just do with your friends with a camera, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7632.72s)]
*  you can do it for whatever cost to rent the clothes and, you know. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7634.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7638.200000000001s)]
*  Once you go over that union line, once you get into like that, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7638.8s)]
*  once somebody calls their agent, you're fucked. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7641.4400000000005s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7643.52s)]
*  It's just the way it is. Yeah. It's expensive. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7644.76s)]
*  It was it. Yeah, man. I just thought it was incredible. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7649.280000000001s)]
*  That moment. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7651.04s)]
*  I don't want to give it away, really. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7652.92s)]
*  But there's a nice moment where the dad comes into the room [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7654.92s)]
*  with Joe. Yeah. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7659.0s)]
*  Yeah. With the phone. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7661.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny because so subtle. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7663.04s)]
*  Well, he had a whole speech that he gave. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7665.08s)]
*  Oh, he didn't. He took it out. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7667.48s)]
*  Yeah, that was the kind of like the point of the whole movie [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7669.5199999999995s)]
*  was that he gives this speech. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7672.04s)]
*  That's what I was kind of way. I was waiting for that a little. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7673.48s)]
*  But then I just accepted that it was just. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7675.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was weird because we did. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7677.88s)]
*  So when we wrote it, it was all about this dad, even though he says [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7679.72s)]
*  nothing through almost the whole movie, he's totally silent. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7684.48s)]
*  And in Joe and his mom are just at loggerheads. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7687.8s)]
*  And she runs the family and he's trying to become an individual [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7691.68s)]
*  but be loved by her. And it's impossible. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7696.92s)]
*  She's withholding like your mom sounds like she was. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7698.88s)]
*  Didn't know how to love, you know. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7701.4400000000005s)]
*  So he's dealing with that. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7702.96s)]
*  But you just see once in a while, we go to these shots that are just quiet, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7704.04s)]
*  private shots of the dad, like not knowing how to deal. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7707.12s)]
*  And Joe has a big anxiety disorder that we kind of portray through weird filming. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7711.320000000001s)]
*  And at one point, we show that the dad also has. Yes. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7715.92s)]
*  Oh, I didn't catch that. I did. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7718.8s)]
*  But I didn't. Yeah. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7720.4s)]
*  Like he's kind of like an undiagnosed older guy with he's got an anxiety [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7721.32s)]
*  disorder, but nobody told him, you know, nobody told that generation. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7724.639999999999s)]
*  There was like a thing wrong with him. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7727.599999999999s)]
*  So he's dealing with that. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7729.2s)]
*  And then and then at the end, when Joe feels like he's kind of figured stuff out, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7730.679999999999s)]
*  he comes in and says this thing. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7734.599999999999s)]
*  And it was this speech where he says he starts trying to he's struggling to talk [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7736.16s)]
*  because he doesn't he's because he's an anxious guy, socially anxious. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7741.96s)]
*  And he starts telling him about he was. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7746.5599999999995s)]
*  He said, when I played football, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7748.8s)]
*  I was a lineman in high school and we were playing Brockton High. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7751.320000000001s)]
*  And he tells a story about seeing the quarterback [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7755.16s)]
*  and that he could sack him and win the game. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7758.84s)]
*  But he hesitated and the guy lofted the pass over his head. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7762.6s)]
*  And but he did in the past missed anyway. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7767.76s)]
*  And then he's about to kind of make his point in the phone rings. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7771.04s)]
*  And he gives up. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7774.88s)]
*  So he gets he gets through the story, but doesn't doesn't make his point. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7777.08s)]
*  But we we played it that way. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7780.08s)]
*  And it just felt it. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7782.56s)]
*  I believed in it so much. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7784.2s)]
*  And when we shot it, when he was the guy who was acting it, Bob Walsh, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7785.12s)]
*  we were all crying. Everybody was crying. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7788.96s)]
*  Joe was crying. Everybody was. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7791.24s)]
*  It was like, this is the thing. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7792.56s)]
*  But then you watch the whole movie. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7794.12s)]
*  You got to want to fucking listen to this bullshit. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7795.2s)]
*  Stupid. And also so much had happened and so much there were. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7797.84s)]
*  We just want to get there. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7801.5199999999995s)]
*  So I tried a version where he comes up and says, hey, the phone rings. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7803.12s)]
*  And he goes, never mind. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7806.88s)]
*  And for some reason, that got all of the emotional that got far more. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7808.32s)]
*  People watch that and they cry. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7812.96s)]
*  And so, yeah, sometimes you just it's what you don't. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7815.52s)]
*  A lot of times in movies is what you take anything you can take out [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7818.36s)]
*  and leave a blank space where like this almost feels like there's a mistake. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7821.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a weird emotional reaction to that. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7826.24s)]
*  Yeah, I got that. The dad was like, oh, here's a woman that cares about you. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7828.68s)]
*  So you need to take. Yes. And he and that was him. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7832.4800000000005s)]
*  He did. I mean, the line is, that's your wife. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7834.88s)]
*  But he pointed at it and he made a thing of it. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7836.72s)]
*  That's your wife. You should take that. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7839.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of meaning in that moment. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7842.08s)]
*  And I think the thing I love about making movies is is that [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7843.88s)]
*  I don't really know what the movie is about. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7847.76s)]
*  The story just kind of comes to you and you sort of it's almost like [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7849.52s)]
*  you're taking dictation, like, I guess this is what happens. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7852.56s)]
*  It just makes you try to write it as involuntarily as possible. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7854.92s)]
*  And then as you make the movie, you get to sit there and watch the shit happen. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7859.320000000001s)]
*  You go, fuck, this is what that means. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7863.52s)]
*  That's why that happened. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7866.04s)]
*  Like you start to learn about it as you make it. Yeah. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7867.6s)]
*  And sometimes actors get lost and you can as a director help them by talking about that. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7870.48s)]
*  I think this is what he's trying. I don't know. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7875.56s)]
*  And sometimes they know and you don't. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7878.72s)]
*  It's fucking it's like it's like if you could do it with life, like deconstruct life [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7880.68s)]
*  and have all the dialogues between your family members in front of you [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7884.4s)]
*  and just watch as the spectator. Yeah. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7887.92s)]
*  But I never feel like it's like about controlling it or saying, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7890.68s)]
*  you got to do this. You just learn you learn through it. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7893.8s)]
*  You know. Yeah. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7896.64s)]
*  And when it's comedy, when it's funny in it. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7897.72s)]
*  You know, it was. Yeah, I found it fascinating. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7900.84s)]
*  I love the sponsor calling and fucking with the dumb lines. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7902.96s)]
*  He's like, oh, this is like a retard. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7906.0s)]
*  But it's the shit you need to hear that keeps you in a fucking comfortable [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7908.0s)]
*  repetition of like, OK, this is what I do every day. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7911.16s)]
*  This is how I get through the day. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7914.4800000000005s)]
*  How I get through it. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7915.92s)]
*  And Joe really wanted it was important to him because I'm not an AA guy, but [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7917.24s)]
*  he it was important to him to have it not be a typical [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7921.36s)]
*  a movie where somebody always falls off the wagon. Yeah. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7925.839999999999s)]
*  And get back on. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7929.08s)]
*  And it's very earnest. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7930.32s)]
*  And it's all just how terrific AA is. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7931.5599999999995s)]
*  He wanted to show that it's a pain in the ass when a guy talks too long [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7934.0s)]
*  and that somebody always complains like I wouldn't shut up. Yeah. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7936.639999999999s)]
*  And and that when you get a sponsor, it's awkward. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7939.599999999999s)]
*  It's fucking it's not it's not lovely. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7943.2s)]
*  It's like, what am I going to say to this fucking guy? [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7946.32s)]
*  I don't even like this guy. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7949.12s)]
*  There's a guy that I met years ago at a meeting. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7951.6s)]
*  I don't even know who he is. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7953.64s)]
*  He calls me fucking once every week, dude. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7954.52s)]
*  And I thought I have no idea what he looks like. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7956.68s)]
*  I have no fucking clue, dude. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7958.64s)]
*  And he drives me absolutely insane. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7961.12s)]
*  But every now and then I'm in a low moment or a high moment or whatever. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7963.2s)]
*  Yeah. And I'll fuck you, you know, and half the time I take the call. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7967.8s)]
*  What's going on? Yeah. You know, I don't know. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7971.4800000000005s)]
*  It's interesting. That whole world's interesting. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7974.72s)]
*  What was it like? So just real quick, you worked with Joe Rogan when you were young, right? [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7976.76s)]
*  When you were younger, do you guys both start in Boston? [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7982.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we both started in Boston, the clubs. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7984.2s)]
*  And he was like a handsomest guy. Remember? Yes, he was. Yeah. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7986.0s)]
*  I mean, Joe's still a handsome guy, right? I love her. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7989.0s)]
*  And but was there any like [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7991.280000000001s)]
*  because now if you're like a handsome comedian, people are like, oh, fuck this guy. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7994.8s)]
*  Yeah, handsomely, not at all. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7998.360000000001s)]
*  No, handsome doesn't help you on stage. Yeah. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=7999.8s)]
*  Was it like where people like that against like whenever he was starting out? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8002.12s)]
*  Well, I remember when he I was I started maybe a couple of years before him. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8005.56s)]
*  So I was starting to feel like, you know, established or in that little Boston scene. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8010.84s)]
*  And then this guy, he started with guys like Greg Fitzsimmons and him. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8016.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're still really close. Yeah. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8020.280000000001s)]
*  And there was a few other guys, Robbie Prince. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8022.6s)]
*  He might have been after. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8025.160000000001s)]
*  But these guys were like new. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8026.84s)]
*  They were the first new guys I was aware of. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8028.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I had been a new guy for a couple of years. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8029.84s)]
*  And so now these were new guys to me. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8033.52s)]
*  So I was probably threatened by them, whatever. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8035.68s)]
*  But I do remember feeling like Greg. Greg was, you know, he's an Irish kind of like. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8038.24s)]
*  He's not as handsome. No, he's not. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8042.88s)]
*  No. Yeah, but not back then. He was more handsome. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8044.96s)]
*  Yeah. Greg's like a bookie fucking like because he is. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8047.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yes. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8050.0s)]
*  But Joe, it wasn't just his looks. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8052.16s)]
*  It was just he had this confidence. Yeah. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8056.28s)]
*  And he's from we grew up in the same town. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8058.32s)]
*  I'm from Newton, Massachusetts. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8060.16s)]
*  He grew up there, too. OK. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8062.04s)]
*  So I went to Newton North High School and he went to Newton South, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8063.32s)]
*  both public schools, but his was kind of fancier. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8066.48s)]
*  They're like kind of richer kids. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8069.48s)]
*  I kind of thought of him as this like Newton South tanning so tan. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8070.52s)]
*  Oh, he looked the dude looks great. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8074.6s)]
*  Yeah. And he was just like, dude, like he didn't he didn't talk like a comic. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8076.32s)]
*  He just said, what the fuck? [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8080.72s)]
*  He talked about fucking chicks and he talked about being getting [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8083.0s)]
*  being hot and getting laid or whatever. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8086.04s)]
*  And he and I could see that he had a power on stage. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8087.92s)]
*  But yeah, I was threatened by him because he was like a good looking guy [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8091.5199999999995s)]
*  a couple of years younger than me started after me, who was getting some attention. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8094.76s)]
*  Yeah. And so on stage, I would be like, what is was was with this guy? [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8098.599999999999s)]
*  But that's I mean, Nick DePaulo started a year after me. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8103.16s)]
*  And we didn't like we were like rivals. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8106.08s)]
*  We didn't like each other at all because we were both like new guys. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8108.44s)]
*  We're getting big laughs. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8111.04s)]
*  But then we were very good friends. Yeah. He's in the movie. Yeah. Yes. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8112.36s)]
*  The funny thing, I didn't even know that that was him until the end. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8116.0s)]
*  I'm talking really. Yeah. Oh, he looks very different. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8118.36s)]
*  Yeah, he looks different. And then Nick. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8120.8s)]
*  Yeah. Somebody's like that thing. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8122.76s)]
*  And I was like, oh, my God, that's where I knew him for a while. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8123.96s)]
*  But I mean, but Joe was in. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8126.400000000001s)]
*  But then I got to know him and I really liked him. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8128.76s)]
*  And he was he was a fascinating guy. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8132.4800000000005s)]
*  He was a Taekwondo like black belt champion. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8134.0s)]
*  He's like a champion. Yeah, he's a real athlete. And [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8136.240000000001s)]
*  we taught we would talk about fighting and life and stuff. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8141.280000000001s)]
*  And I just liked him. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8145.6s)]
*  As soon as I got to know him, I liked him. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8147.2s)]
*  And then I started watching like any comedian [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8148.84s)]
*  you first see when you go, what was so great about him? [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8151.96s)]
*  I mean, when you're younger. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8154.4800000000005s)]
*  But I watched him, then I go, then I started to really respect what he [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8155.52s)]
*  and most of what he got good after I knew him [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8159.28s)]
*  because he was still just new and raw. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8162.64s)]
*  And he was I felt he was killing because he was there is a level where you can [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8164.52s)]
*  the girls like you on stage. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8168.88s)]
*  He was also fucking every weight, every hot weight. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8170.68s)]
*  He was getting all the fuck. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8173.68s)]
*  How are you supposed to like it like that? [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8175.360000000001s)]
*  But but personally, one on one, I really did like him a lot. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8177.48s)]
*  And then I started to fuck him, but I would have fucking stood by [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8180.599999999999s)]
*  and watch him put your hand on the back. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8183.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would have put it. Yeah. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8185.4s)]
*  Little little of this with Joe Rogan. Not bad. Yeah. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8187.32s)]
*  But he was also interesting as a guy and not typical. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8190.799999999999s)]
*  Some guys who are handsome are trapped by that, you know. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8196.32s)]
*  But he was an interesting dude. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8200.24s)]
*  And then when he went on and and I'd hear his stand up, [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8201.88s)]
*  I I was like, that's he's working and he's good. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8205.56s)]
*  And I liked his stand up. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8208.599999999999s)]
*  And then he we had kind of a crossroads thing [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8211.119999999999s)]
*  because he did that thing with Carlos Mencia where he outed him for stealing. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8214.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Which however you feel about that, but it was his he was very [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8218.759999999998s)]
*  he's adamantly about it. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8222.279999999999s)]
*  And then his agency, Gersh, told him, if you don't dump, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8223.72s)]
*  if you don't stop, if you don't apologize to Carlos, we'll dump you. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8229.359999999999s)]
*  And that was my agency was Gersh. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8233.96s)]
*  And so he let them go. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8236.44s)]
*  And I heard that and I was like, that's crazy. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8238.08s)]
*  And I called him and we didn't we hadn't talked in a long time, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8241.4s)]
*  but I contacted him to say, I need to hear from you if that's a true story. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8244.92s)]
*  And he said, 100 percent. Wow. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8248.92s)]
*  They called me and they said, apologize or you're out of the agency. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8250.6s)]
*  And that's all I needed to hear. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8255.16s)]
*  I called them and I said, you're not my agents anymore. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8256.48s)]
*  What if I have an argument with another comedian? [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8259.08s)]
*  What are you fucking nuts? Yeah. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8260.84s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8262.68s)]
*  So I dumped them. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8264.12s)]
*  And then I got started to know that side of Joe. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8265.68s)]
*  That's like he believes what he believes. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8269.960000000001s)]
*  He goes by it, whether it's going to hurt him or not. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8271.84s)]
*  And I've always known him that way. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8275.24s)]
*  We just would run. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8276.48s)]
*  Our friendship has been like running into each other in the parking lot [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8278.04s)]
*  of this comedy store and talking for a couple of hours about life. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8280.2s)]
*  And that's most of comedians. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8283.56s)]
*  Yeah. People always ask what he's like. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8285.76s)]
*  He's one of the most genuinely curious guys I ever met. Yeah. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8286.92s)]
*  Like he has like any as he just retains information so well. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8289.800000000001s)]
*  And people are always like, we a lot of you podcast guys, you guys, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8293.64s)]
*  so Brogan's dick, you know, you know, that kind of stuff. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8295.92s)]
*  You like him and he's number one. Yeah. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8298.12s)]
*  And he's good at it. Yeah. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8300.84s)]
*  It's like you want to look like you want to learn and look up and like not emulate, [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8302.16s)]
*  but you there's a certain homage, especially in a space where guys [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8306.72s)]
*  like him and Marin and some other guys, you know, but even you, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8310.880000000001s)]
*  even putting your stuff on your website for five dollars early on. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8314.36s)]
*  That was like it was a pioneers type of move. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8316.8s)]
*  A lot of people were like, yes, guys, that's crazy. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8320.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of new at the time. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8321.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it only works if you have your fans already. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8323.359999999999s)]
*  It doesn't help you get fans. Right. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8326.519999999999s)]
*  So a lot of I know some comics did it after me and they're like, I'm going to do it. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8328.56s)]
*  But they did. I worked for me because I was swelling. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8332.039999999999s)]
*  I was starting to get a shit ton of. Right. You had a fan base. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8334.759999999998s)]
*  But it doesn't help you gather. It's the thing. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8338.279999999999s)]
*  And I do think that to some degree, because I don't have that allure [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8340.56s)]
*  in the media attention as much. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8344.84s)]
*  It's sometimes it feels like it's getting it's just wearing down a little bit, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8346.64s)]
*  you know, because it's just me and them. Right. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8350.08s)]
*  So getting new people doesn't come as easily. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8352.24s)]
*  But I that's such an easy thing to accept. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8354.8s)]
*  Also, I'm 55. I mean, how many more years am I going to be alive? [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8358.28s)]
*  You know, let alone working. Yeah. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8361.48s)]
*  It's not like I needed to just keep piling up and getting bigger. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8363.44s)]
*  But I mean, you've got I mean, you've got I mean, you've got you've gotten it. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8366.2s)]
*  I mean, you've gotten to be that big. Yeah, exactly. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8370.0s)]
*  You don't need to stay big. That's crazy. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8374.720000000001s)]
*  And it's all kind of it's all this mythological type of thing. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8377.0s)]
*  It's all this, you know, it's like that whole business, it all kind of is [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8380.2s)]
*  works together. It's like the age and his friends with the press guy. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8384.24s)]
*  It's all this. Yeah. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8387.52s)]
*  And once somebody gets big, then then there's this crazy rush towards them [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8388.84s)]
*  because they're big and people just go, well, I guess I like him too. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8392.56s)]
*  But that never lasts. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8395.52s)]
*  And it's like going to space. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8397.56s)]
*  You just got to be able to come. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8400.12s)]
*  You just come back down and you land in a lake and you land in a lake. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8401.24s)]
*  And then you're left with whatever amount of fans you have. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8404.68s)]
*  And that's your cruising altitude. Yeah. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8407.36s)]
*  And that because everybody has that trajectory. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8409.56s)]
*  And then you don't know here about them. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8411.92s)]
*  But they're out there touring, you know, Pearl Jam isn't at the Grammys anymore. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8413.28s)]
*  Right. But they're fucking selling out whatever size place they want to. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8417.92s)]
*  They're just in the, you know, you get your orbit [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8422.28s)]
*  if you're lucky and not everybody gets to have that. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8425.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Motley Crue is one of the like [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8427.92s)]
*  brought in one of the most money's last year I read somewhere. Right. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8430.04s)]
*  Which blew my mind. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8432.84s)]
*  Yeah. Nobody's talking about Motley Crue. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8433.759999999998s)]
*  But the fact that they're yeah, they stay busy. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8435.439999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of there's a lot of work out there. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8437.8s)]
*  But also, I don't I think I mean, I don't know. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8439.8s)]
*  That's why the show at the garden that I'm doing and I'm live streaming. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8441.84s)]
*  And it's all sold. Yeah. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8445.119999999999s)]

*  to that to that level. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8467.84s)]
*  And then I'm going to take a break for a while. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8470.720000000001s)]
*  I think I might take a year or more off and not perform for a while. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8472.16s)]
*  I want to feel what life feels like with that. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8475.640000000001s)]
*  I haven't done that since I was 18. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8477.08s)]

*  maybe the first time that I'd seen comedy that I went to and stood in line [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8484.24s)]
*  and went to see. Yeah. Wow. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8486.960000000001s)]

*  I don't I haven't done that in a long time myself. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8490.52s)]
*  It was so cool McDonald's last guy I went to bought a ticket and sat and watched [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8492.2s)]
*  a few years ago. It was great. Yeah. Great. Great. Great. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8497.0s)]

*  Oh, yeah. We're just see him. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8502.84s)]
*  I saw him in Chicago at the Chicago Theater. No shit. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8504.36s)]
*  Yeah. And he was telling jokes and I was like, oh, these are just jokes [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8506.76s)]
*  that he fucking read off the Internet. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8509.48s)]
*  Right. No. But then I realized, no, the jokes were just such old baked [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8510.960000000001s)]
*  in the society that he had fucking created them. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8515.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Of course. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8518.0s)]

*  And then I'm like, oh, he fucking made these up. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8524.76s)]
*  I met him once. He was with Don Rickles. Wow. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8528.2s)]
*  And they were at a restaurant I was at and the two of them and their wives [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8531.28s)]
*  were sitting and and one of their wives or somebody came from that table [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8535.24s)]
*  over to me and said, Don would like to say hi to you. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8539.16s)]
*  So I walked back to the table and Don had his back to me. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8542.400000000001s)]

*  Is he that fucking piece of shit is not coming over? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8547.12s)]
*  Oh, hi. Like he did a thing and he just starts shitting on me. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8549.0s)]
*  He's like, look at you. What are you? What is this? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8553.0s)]

*  And Bob's got this huge beaming smile on his face [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8559.4s)]
*  because he can see that his friend is happy. Yeah. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8562.04s)]
*  And and I just stood there and took a beating [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8564.4s)]
*  for about 10 minutes and just, you know, and said hello to the ladies. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8567.44s)]

*  It was like a few months before he died, I think. Wow. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8577.92s)]
*  He took my shirt and pulled me down and he said, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8580.36s)]
*  don't let him forget me. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8584.72s)]
*  Please don't let people forget me who I was. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8586.44s)]

*  Isn't that something? Yeah. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8592.64s)]
*  Anyway, nobody remembers who that is. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8595.76s)]
*  We know. Yeah, we know. Yep. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8598.92s)]
*  But that's yeah, it's wild that it all goes back into the sauce, man. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8601.56s)]
*  Uh huh. It all goes back into the fucking. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8604.4s)]
*  Yeah, whatever you're able to do, everybody's going to forget all of it. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8606.92s)]
*  All of it. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8611.04s)]
*  I feel like we got to keep a little of it. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8612.44s)]
*  That's why I don't want to be cremated. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8615.2s)]
*  And when I see people that are getting cremated, I'm like, you're a fucking [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8616.4s)]
*  because what if even a little bit of you is alive, you know? Huh? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8619.44s)]
*  Yeah. You think that body might still be alive? [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8623.16s)]
*  You have eight cells left. You have billions of fucking cells. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8626.52s)]
*  You don't fucking 30 cells left in the lake. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8628.72s)]
*  You think that's going to be you? Like, that's you. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8630.92s)]
*  I think it has some recollection. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8632.960000000001s)]
*  It has some memory of. Yeah. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8635.16s)]
*  I think it holds. Why does it need to stay alive? [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8636.6s)]
*  You feel like it needs to as long as you can hang in there. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8639.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then you're like, oh, fuck, I'm getting grilled. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8641.92s)]
*  Like, this is the absolute worst. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8644.84s)]
*  You're going to get buried, I think, buried straight into the ground. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8646.48s)]
*  You know, actually, I used to only get shot out of a cannon [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8649.4s)]
*  and like a schoolyard and the first kid to touch my dick fucking wins. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8651.880000000001s)]
*  Wins all my money. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8655.48s)]
*  That's not bad. That's not bad. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8658.16s)]
*  There's places you can get buried right in the ground without a box like Maine. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8660.76s)]
*  I think you can throw a body in the ground anywhere you want. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8663.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah, there's nothing any good. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8666.52s)]
*  I want to believe with a few more chicks around now, I think. Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8668.84s)]
*  I don't really have any wishes for after. Really? Yeah. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8673.880000000001s)]
*  I want to leave that up to my kids because they'll be the ones that have to experience it. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8676.480000000001s)]
*  What do you think they'll do? [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8681.12s)]
*  I don't know. It depends on how I do. Yeah. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8682.560000000001s)]
*  It's up to me. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8685.4s)]
*  It's all up to us. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8688.24s)]
*  Louis, anything else, guys, you wanted to ask that? [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8690.16s)]
*  Yeah, last question. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8693.4s)]
*  I saw Fourth of July in theaters and a lot of the people were [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8694.84s)]
*  I feel like their reaction is how hype they were to see comedians in a movie, [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8697.6s)]
*  like actual comics in a movie. Yeah. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8701.08s)]
*  What other comics do you want to see in movies? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8703.6s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8706.76s)]
*  You'd have a project or something. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8708.960000000001s)]
*  I wrote a movie with a friend of mine that I'm going to try to make next year. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8710.52s)]
*  But it's really twisted, weird movie and it's probably going to be too expensive. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8716.52s)]
*  So I may not get to make it. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8719.68s)]
*  But I'm going to try. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8721.32s)]
*  I don't know if there's any comedians in that one. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8722.32s)]
*  I like, you know, who I always thought would be a good dramatic actor. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8724.2s)]
*  It is Tim Heidegger. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8729.36s)]
*  You know who he is? Tim and Eric. Yeah. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8731.68s)]
*  Tim Heidegger is I saw him. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8735.0s)]
*  I was in London. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8737.0s)]
*  It's how crazy my life was. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8739.28s)]
*  I had just made a movie which never came out and I went to London [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8740.48s)]
*  because I did the music at Abbey Road Studios. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8744.36s)]
*  I was just I was like I was telling him before I was shooting. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8746.6s)]
*  I was telling him before I was shitting money. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8749.880000000001s)]
*  Then I was just now I just shit shit. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8751.48s)]
*  At the time, I shit money and I had made this movie and I had a composer [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8754.4s)]
*  because I wanted to do an orchestra score. Yeah. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8760.92s)]
*  And he said, OK, we can get a great orchestra, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8763.72s)]
*  a really great orchestra for like one hundred fifty thousand bucks. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8767.64s)]
*  They'll be the best in any any movie you've watched recently would have this orchestra. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8770.800000000001s)]
*  Or we can go to Abbey Road and get the best players in Europe, [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8774.76s)]
*  like the best players at every instrument for three hundred thousand. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8778.68s)]
*  And I was like, it's just a check, bro. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8784.0s)]
*  Fucking yeah. Let's get go. Let's go. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8785.52s)]
*  And I went to Abbey Road and we recorded music with a full orchestra. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8788.04s)]
*  It's the fucking sickest thing. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8792.0s)]
*  It's it's like I was a coke addict. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8794.04s)]
*  It was a really crazy thing to do. Yeah. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8795.6s)]
*  But anyway, while I was there, Tim Heidegger was playing at the Soho Theater. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8797.960000000001s)]
*  So I just went to watch him and he was wearing this [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8801.800000000001s)]
*  leather jacket that was, you know, like a leather blazer. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8805.88s)]
*  Yeah. And he had his hair slicked back and he's just he's a very [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8808.960000000001s)]
*  you don't know where he's coming from guy. Yeah. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8812.68s)]
*  Just being really weird and sarcastic, but seeming real at the same time. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8814.64s)]
*  And I was riveted by his show. He got a few laughs. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8819.4s)]
*  He wasn't he's not like a killer comic because he doesn't try to be. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8821.960000000001s)]
*  But I thought that guy would be a really I'd like to see him kill somebody in a movie. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8825.36s)]
*  I like to see him. Yeah. He's got a gasey vibe. Gasey. Yeah, a little bit. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8829.0s)]
*  I think he could do some I think he could scare the shit out of somebody in a movie. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8833.08s)]
*  Yeah. That's when I look at comedians, I look at that. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8836.52s)]
*  There's guys that you you go, that guy's going to get me laughs. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8839.44s)]
*  I won't make a movie without Bobby Kelly, probably ever. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8843.039999999999s)]
*  He's just the greatest face in the movie. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8845.56s)]
*  Nick DePaul, these are just the guys who I just go like, he's got to be in it. Yeah. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8847.64s)]
*  Bobby's a sweet guy. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8852.48s)]
*  A Laura Keitlinger, who I mentioned before, I'd love I'd love to see her in a movie [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8853.68s)]
*  someday. Still, she's just she was in a sitcom I did for one season and she was great. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8856.84s)]
*  There's a lot of a lot of people that you captured. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8861.68s)]

*  Yeah, me too, man. It's interesting. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8891.96s)]
*  I don't like podcasts. They're too serious. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8893.76s)]
*  And everybody talks about, you know, their view on life. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8896.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And everybody talks about the same fucking shit. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8899.76s)]
*  It's just the same four subjects we've been talking about since like 2012. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8903.16s)]
*  And it's really boring. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8907.56s)]
*  I feel like we talked about those, the comedy jerk and all. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8908.76s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. But those are that's real life. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8911.359999999999s)]
*  We talked about real life. Yeah. I enjoyed the hell out of it. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8913.16s)]
*  Oh, thank you, man. I did too, man. This was a real honor. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8915.16s)]
*  And once again, you're hysterically funny kind of guy. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8917.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're not in any comic. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8920.36s)]
*  And I hope that you focus on stand-up. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8921.960000000001s)]
*  I know this is good, but I hope that you stay on stage a lot, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8924.36s)]
*  because if you've only been doing it for 18 years, you're not even there yet. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8927.76s)]
*  I mean, if that's how good you are now, then if you keep the stand-up being number one, [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8932.36s)]
*  and when you get to about 22 years or so, you're going to be unstoppable. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8937.76s)]
*  So I hope you do. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8945.560000000001s)]
*  Thank you, man. Yeah. I hope to. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8946.76s)]
*  I think that's where I'm at right now, figuring out kind of how to evolve, you know? [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8948.56s)]
*  Good. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8951.359999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much, Louis C.K. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DHmRZy28E&t=8952.359999999999s)]
