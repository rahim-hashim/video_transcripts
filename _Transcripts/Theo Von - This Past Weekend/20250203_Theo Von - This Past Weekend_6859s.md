*  Today's guest is Lila [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=34.34s)]
*  McElwain [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=36.58s)]
*  So take down [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=50.86s)]
*  Inside the fight to shut down porn hub for child abuse rape and sex trafficking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=52.58s)]
*  This is your book and I'm sitting here with Lila McElwain [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=57.3s)]
*  Nice to be here [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  You almost got it Lila McElwain, okay, so I didn't get it Lila McElwain [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=65.38s)]
*  How did your war against porn hubs start? Sure. I will tell you that story [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so in the context of years in the fight against sex trafficking [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=76.02s)]
*  So I had been fighting sex trafficking when this began this began at the start of 2020 [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=80.66s)]
*  This is February 2020 when the the fight to hold PornHub accountable for rape sex trafficking child abuse began [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=85.94s)]
*  And that was in the context of over a decade in the fight against trafficking at that point [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  And I had been paying attention to the headlines obviously when when sexual abuse stories trafficking stories [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=96.38s)]
*  came up, you know, I was paying attention and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  One of the stories that came up at late 2019 [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=106.46s)]
*  That really arrested my attention [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=110.54s)]
*  It was a story of a 15 year old girl and she was from Broward County, Florida [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=112.54s)]
*  And she was missing for an entire year and she was finally found [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=116.34s)]
*  When her distraught mother was tipped off by a PornHub user that he recognized her daughter on the site [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=120.5s)]
*  Wow, and she was found in 58 videos being abused for profit [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=125.5s)]
*  These are monetized videos police, you know were [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=131.26s)]
*  Dispatched and they actually rescued her out of his apartment [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=135.38s)]
*  She had been impregnated [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, they got her out of that situation [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=140.78s)]
*  But that was a story that had made some headlines and it was a horrifying story at the same time [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=142.82s)]
*  There was an investigation that was released by the Sunday Times the London Sunday Times and they had found [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=147.98s)]
*  Dozens of illegal videos on PornHub within minutes even children as young as three [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=154.14s)]
*  So these two particular stories were standing out [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=159.38s)]
*  There was one other that was really horrifying at the time [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  it was about an adult a woman named Nicole Adamando and she was from New York and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=166.38000000000002s)]
*  She was being abused by her partner. She was being raped and tortured [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  He was filming it and he was uploading it to PornHub and then she ended up killing him in self-defense [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  but she was sentenced to life in prison separated from her two young children and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=181.66000000000003s)]
*  Thankfully, she had an amazing legal team and they fought that and they got it reduced to seven years [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=187.22000000000003s)]
*  And she's finally out today [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=191.66s)]
*  But it was just a heartbreaking story [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=193.9s)]
*  And so I at the time, you know, I was really actually discouraged in my fight against trafficking [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=196.78s)]
*  I had been doing it for a long time. I felt like we weren't making very much progress [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=201.9s)]
*  But you know, it's not something that I can quit because i'm dedicated to this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=205.9s)]
*  But I was up late one night [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=210.06s)]
*  In uh in early 2020. It was I think it was let's see january 31st 2020 [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  And I was consoling my own crying baby at that time because he was born he had a birth complication [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=218.54s)]
*  He was a very mad baby. What do you mean? Oh crying baby? Yeah crying baby. Okay. Yeah, he was up [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, I was up at all hours of the night. I thought you said crying baby. I was like oh what is a crying baby? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=229.17999999999998s)]
*  No crying baby. Okay. Yeah, and so I was up late [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=234.06s)]
*  consoling him [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=237.66s)]
*  and thinking about that story of the 15 year old girl [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=239.1s)]
*  And suddenly, you know an idea came to mind. I just said [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=243.42s)]
*  You know what? How are they vetting these videos? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=247.82s)]
*  Um, how was this abuse ending up on pornhub and an idea? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=250.38s)]
*  Just flashed into mind said i'm going to test the upload system for myself and i'm going to see what does it take? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=255.18s)]
*  To upload content to pornhub [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=260.78s)]
*  so [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=263.34s)]
*  Put the baby down got out my phone [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=264.22s)]
*  Um took a video of the computer screen and the rug in the dark room [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=267.1s)]
*  And I uploaded it to pornhub and I found out what millions of people already knew [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=271.74s)]
*  Because at that time millions of videos were being uploaded every year [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=276.7s)]
*  In fact the amount of content that was being uploaded to pornhub if you put those videos back to back just the amount of content [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=279.98s)]
*  They would upload in one year. It would take 169 years to watch if you put those videos back to back [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=286.38s)]
*  That's how much content was being uploaded uploaded or had been uploaded total you mean no per year. Wow [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=292.7s)]
*  Yes, that's not even counting the images [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=298.94s)]
*  so I um [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  Tested the I found out like I said what millions of people already knew and that was that all it took to upload [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=303.66s)]
*  Was an email address so in under 10 minutes anybody with an iphone [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  Anywhere in the world can upload a video and they were not checking age [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=314.54s)]
*  They were not checking id to make sure that these are not children in the videos. They're not verifying consent [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=318.94000000000005s)]
*  To make sure that these are not rape or trafficking victims and because of that. I quickly understood that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=324.62s)]
*  Pornhub was not a porn site. It was a crime scene like it was infested with videos of real sexual crime [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=330.3s)]
*  Um, and so then the people would upload them and then make money what off of advertising on them somehow or yes [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=336.62s)]
*  Yeah, so the so the ones that were making money off of this content because this is free porn, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=343.26s)]
*  Right, uh free porn is not free, right? It is heavily monetized [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=348.46s)]
*  With ads so they were selling 4.6 billion ad impressions on Pornhub every single day [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=353.58s)]
*  So they were heavily monetizing this content now the people who were uploading were doing it mostly for free [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=360.38s)]
*  Like 80 percent of people who are uploading were just doing it for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=365.34s)]
*  Social currency like likes and clicks and comments and shares and all of that the reason why people upload to social media, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  Um [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=376.78s)]
*  Some of them were doing pay to download content where they could actually do profit sharing with Pornhub that was happening as well [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=378.14s)]
*  But most of the money made from free porn is actually made by the corporation running the site, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=384.62s)]
*  and just to give you a little bit of um [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=391.5s)]
*  Context for how big Pornhub and its parent company are who are making all of this money [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=393.96s)]
*  So Pornhub at the time so by december of 2020 they had capitalized on coronavirus [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=399.82s)]
*  So they had done crazy stunts like free premium to the whole entire world [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=405.12s)]
*  Um, oh, I remember something like that. Yeah, they had um done some crazy [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=411.12s)]
*  Pr campaigns at the time because the people they figure people are stuck at home. They'll watch porn [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=417.6s)]
*  Yeah, well it was that plus they were getting tons of bad press because trafficking hub movement had gone viral [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=421.76s)]
*  Starting at the beginning of the year and trafficking hub movement was what so i'll okay, so i'll go back to the story [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=427.6s)]
*  So well really quick. I want to tell you kind of just so you know what we're dealing with like how big [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=433.2s)]
*  Okay, yeah, how big Pornhub is? Okay. So by the end of december 2020 so they had grown [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=437.6s)]
*  uh to be the fifth most [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  Visited website in the entire world [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=447.6s)]
*  So not just porn site website [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=450.24s)]
*  They had 170 million visits per day 62 billion visits per year [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=453.36s)]
*  And like I said enough content uploaded every year take 169 years to watch so they had 56 [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=459.36s)]
*  Million pieces of content on the site by the end of 2020 [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=464.56s)]
*  And this was the year that trafficking hub movement began. So go back to the story. So I made this discovery [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=468.56s)]
*  Oh my god, and I said massive I said, oh I literally said what you just oh my god [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=475.04s)]
*  This site is infested with videos [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=482.16s)]
*  of rape [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=485.04s)]
*  Trafficking non-consensual content we used to call it revenge porn, but we call it image-based sexual abuse [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=486.64s)]
*  uh, and I have to sound the alarm on this I have to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  uh, you know [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  Tell people what's going on [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  And so I did [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=499.76s)]
*  The only thing that I could do at the time was I took to my it was twitter right at the time twitter [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=501.76s)]
*  And I started to share this information share the stories share [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=507.28s)]
*  The the what I discovered about the upload process and in a burst of inspiration [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=511.92s)]
*  I shared the hashtag trafficking hub and the reason why I did that is because [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=516.96s)]
*  per definition so by definition [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=522.88s)]
*  any sex act that is commercialized and it's involving a child or any [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=526.48s)]
*  Sex act that's induced by force fraud or coercion and it's commercialized. So it's for profit [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=532.16s)]
*  Like it's something of value is exchanged for that sex act. It is per definition an act of trafficking [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=538.48s)]
*  So every child being abused on pornhub every adult who was non-consenting who was raped in traffic [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=545.44s)]
*  Those are instances of trafficking [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=552.08s)]
*  I don't think people quite understand that but that is per international definition and domestic definition [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  And so that's why I launched the trafficking hub hashtag and it slowly started to catch on [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=561.44s)]
*  I had a few thousand followers on twitter at the time, but people were horrified to find this out [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=565.6s)]
*  oh, yeah, well, I think when you hear trafficking you kind of think like I mean I picture literally like a [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=571.2s)]
*  train like [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=577.1s)]
*  People commandeered from other countries or you know [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=578.88s)]
*  I guess younger people that have commandeered and kidnapped and like a train car going across the country in the night or something like [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=582.08s)]
*  I think of it as a as a more like people like being smuggled across the border or you know, I don't think of it as um [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=588.24s)]
*  I guess the average person doesn't think of it in such a a common kind of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's common is the word. I guess yeah [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=600.16s)]
*  The average person probably doesn't think of that. It's that expansive, right? You know, yeah [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=602.64s)]
*  Well, that's the way it's portrayed in hollywood movies and that's the way that it happens [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=606.48s)]
*  Often right sometimes but you know the amount of trafficking going on if you think about [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=610.96s)]
*  non-consensual [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=616.94s)]
*  commercialized [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=618.14s)]
*  Sex acts this is massive [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=619.28s)]
*  Um, and so unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah, I mean and so uh sound the alarm [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=622.64s)]
*  launch traffic m hashtag [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  That started to catch on people started to message me somebody said hey if you don't start a petition [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=632.0s)]
*  Um, oh then I wrote an op-ed so I said, okay. Well, what else can I do besides just share this on social media? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=638.24s)]
*  This has to get out to more people so I wrote an op-ed about what I discovered an op-ed means opinion [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=643.84s)]
*  It's like an essay. Yeah, right. I just want our listeners to know most of our listeners are just like me. They don't know [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=651.04s)]
*  um, yeah, so op-ed means an opinion editorial so uh, like something that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  Your opinion you'd write it into like a publication that'd be published in a newspaper something like that. Yeah, okay [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=661.36s)]
*  Great. Just want our listeners to always know what that is exactly what it is [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  And so I wrote that with kind of the findings highlighting some of these stories that had just been in the news making the connections [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=668.4s)]
*  And that really caught on, you know, people were sharing it and somebody who read it messaged me and they said hey [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=674.88s)]
*  You need to start a petition to shut down porn hub and hold its executives accountable [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=681.52s)]
*  And if you don't do it, I will I said, okay [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=685.52s)]
*  Well, i'll do that. So I just went on change.org. I started a petition and instantly started going viral [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=687.76s)]
*  So on change.org you started a petition. I started it there. Yeah now it's at trafficking hub petition.com and today we have [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  Um 2.3 million people who have signed the petition from every country in the world. Let's go [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=699.76s)]
*  We're gonna get more that's we got to get more. It's trafficking hub petition.com [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  And this has been powerful to have this because as this was going viral [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=711.62s)]
*  Victims were seeing it and then they were starting to reach out to me [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=717.2s)]
*  Um, sometimes on a daily basis victims that I was exploited on pornhub as a child as a teen [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=720.1s)]
*  I was raped I was unconscious and I was raped on pornhub and I begged to get those videos down and I couldn't you know [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=725.1400000000001s)]
*  All these stories started to come forward [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=730.1800000000001s)]
*  Not only that but whistleblowers from inside the company started to reach out to me [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=732.34s)]
*  And started to expose the inner workings of the company [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=736.9s)]
*  Even the former owner of pornhub actually reached out to me to say he wanted to help with all this [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=740.18s)]
*  He had his own motives, but right probably trying to cover his own tracks [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=745.06s)]
*  Well, yeah, he had I discovered that he had some financial motivations for wanting to do that [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=748.34s)]
*  But he did [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=754.34s)]
*  And one of the things that was so important at this outset [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=755.78s)]
*  Uh was we felt like you know this company that trafficking is a transactional crime [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=759.46s)]
*  All of this is being done for money like that's the only thing that these companies care about right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=764.82s)]
*  And in order to you know, make a difference here. We have to hit them where it hurts [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=770.26s)]
*  We have to go after the money and so we said we have to go after the credit cards [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=774.1s)]
*  um to cut ties with pornhub and when the owner reached out he [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=779.5400000000001s)]
*  Confirmed that he said listen, the only thing they care about is money if you you go after the credit cards [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  That's the achilles heel of pornhub. Um, so you're saying if visa and master guard [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=788.74s)]
*  They will say we will not allow our credit cards to be used that would be the worst thing that could ever happen to pornhub [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=793.22s)]
*  Yes, because they you know, they need those that in order to sell ads premium memberships all of that [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=798.5s)]
*  Um, so reached out to try, you know, credit card executives did letters, you know organizations were signing on [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=805.22s)]
*  Um, so all of this was building momentum. The petition was gaining steam and that's why lots of media articles started to be written about this [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=812.82s)]
*  Um, what like were some of the crimes that you see like saw happening? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  What were some specific instances that you were like? Oh my god. This is just yeah. I mean, okay [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=824.74s)]
*  I mean is it okay to share those or yeah, of course [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=830.82s)]
*  um, and I think it's important to share because I think a lot of times people want to just dismiss it and say, you know, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=832.98s)]
*  What you saw was just consensual. You just didn't really understand that it was you know, these were obvious [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=840.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's vague until you make it specific I feel like a lot of times so for example [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=847.38s)]
*  And I'll tell you some I can tell you some victim stories [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=851.9399999999999s)]
*  I can tell you some of the things that I saw myself on the site [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=854.98s)]
*  I mean one of the worst things that I saw [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=857.46s)]
*  On the site was an instance where um, it was a young asian woman [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=859.86s)]
*  And she was drugged so completely that she was her body was completely limp [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=864.9s)]
*  She was unconscious and there was a masked [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=871.78s)]
*  Ascelant who actually to prove to the camera that she was unconscious [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=874.7399999999999s)]
*  He was lifting her eyelids and touching her eyeballs to prove that she wasn't responsive because and then tickling her feet and doing things like that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=879.62s)]
*  um, and then the title was in chinese [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=888.66s)]
*  And so what I did was I took the title and I put it into google translate and the title [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=892.3399999999999s)]
*  was [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=897.62s)]
*  um dead pig [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=898.74s)]
*  drug unconscious after being drugged [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=900.74s)]
*  And it included eyes half open after being drugged like that was the actual [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=905.22s)]
*  Title of the video and then of course because there's the algorithm right they have set up the algorithm [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=910.42s)]
*  To make sure if you see one video like that, they're going to assume that you like that content [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=916.58s)]
*  So then they're going to take you on a crazy [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=921.38s)]
*  rabbit hole I call it like [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=924.26s)]
*  you know [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=926.66s)]
*  Just hell hole of rape like that's what it was and then you go and they'll show you more and more of the same [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=927.7s)]
*  Kind of thing, you know [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=935.46s)]
*  In my book, I do describe [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=937.86s)]
*  These videos I don't really hold back because I want people to know [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=939.94s)]
*  What actually was taking place what these victims were going through on the site? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=943.94s)]
*  and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=948.74s)]
*  One of the things that victims have shared that I think is also really important to know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=949.7800000000001s)]
*  Is that when those videos are uploaded they had a download button so that anybody in the world could actually [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=954.98s)]
*  download and possess [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=962.1s)]
*  That child abuse the rape all of that on their devices and then re-upload it again and again and again and again [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=964.26s)]
*  And so victims actually call this the immortalization of their trauma [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=972.26s)]
*  So they say it's one thing to be raped [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=976.98s)]
*  But then it's filmed and then it's uploaded and then it's monetized for profit and pleasure and people are actually getting pleasure [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=979.38s)]
*  out of the worst moment of my life [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=986.82s)]
*  And it'll never go away [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=989.22s)]
*  Because once it's on the internet, it's out of control and it's just like this whack-a-mole game where they're constantly just [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=991.14s)]
*  Trying to find it and then beg for it to come down and then even if they can it just gets uploaded again [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=997.62s)]
*  and one victim said [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1003.22s)]
*  My abuser put me in a mental prison [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1005.7s)]
*  But Pornhub gave me a life sentence. Wow [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1009.38s)]
*  And that was really powerful but were all these like for the foreign were they domestic was everywhere. It was everywhere. So [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1012.4200000000001s)]
*  Here's one story. I'll share with you. Um [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1020.74s)]
*  Serena flightus. So serena flightus. She's from bakersfield, california [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1024.02s)]
*  She was an innocent 13 year old girl [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1029.3s)]
*  And she had a crush on a boy a year older than her. So she [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1032.58s)]
*  Uh, you know at the time she'd never kissed a boy before she was a straight a student [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1036.74s)]
*  And he convinced her to send him some nude images and videos of herself [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1041.3s)]
*  Which she did because she wanted to impress him, right? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1046.02s)]
*  This is like very common today sexting all that and then he shared it with classmates [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1048.5s)]
*  And then the classmates uploaded to Pornhub where it began to get millions and millions of views [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1053.7s)]
*  So she would then reach out to Pornhub and beg for them to take the videos down and they would often ignore her [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1059.0600000000002s)]

*  Fabian tillman, he's the one that put pornhub on the map, you know [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1622.76s)]
*  He kind of had this vision for the german entrepreneur who once built the biggest adult entertainment company in the world [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1625.8s)]
*  Let's see him [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1633.32s)]
*  That's him [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1635.08s)]
*  fabian [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1636.68s)]
*  Okay, so he is [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1639.0800000000002s)]
*  He's one of the guys schlepping it [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1641.4s)]
*  So he yeah [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1643.5600000000002s)]
*  So he's the one who actually revealed to me who the secret majority shareholder was that he sold the company to [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1644.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's how we found out who he was. Okay, so the movement's getting bigger, right? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1650.04s)]
*  So you have the traffic hub? Yep trafficking hub. It's taking off [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1654.76s)]
*  So we're even out protesting on the streets outside of my geek headquarters in montreal and london and la [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1658.76s)]
*  You know sharing all tons of viral victim stories are happening and then [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1667.1599999999999s)]
*  One of the things that we're going up through having all these meetings with the credit card companies executives trying to present evidence and evidence [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1671.8s)]
*  And more evidence to them and saying listen you have to stop [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1677.9599999999998s)]
*  monetizing this content because actually [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1681.78s)]
*  It's even illegal to knowingly benefit from trafficking in the united states, right? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1684.6s)]
*  So at that point if they know if you put the knowledge on them that they're benefiting from it [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1689.0s)]
*  Then that becomes a crime against knowingly benefiting from trafficking and trying to bring this to them and saying listen you have to stop [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1692.52s)]
*  But they were resisting right? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1698.84s)]
*  Why because it's so much money you think um, I think there's multiple reasons [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1700.92s)]
*  I think it's because once it's they feel like this is a slippery slope if we do this here [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1704.92s)]
*  We might have to do it there and they just don't want to take action [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1709.16s)]
*  Unless they're forced to take action. So they're like we're really concerned. This is so concerning [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1713.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you for bringing this to us give us more information more information. I give more information. They want more information [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1719.8s)]
*  Anyway, they're resisting, right? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1725.96s)]
*  then [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1728.9199999999998s)]
*  um, so I reach out and [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1729.96s)]
*  Get the attention of nick christoph from the new york times. So nick christoph has a history of really [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1732.44s)]
*  Compassionate reporting for victims of human trafficking and sex trafficking specifically [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1739.1399999999999s)]
*  So I was thinking if there's anybody in the world that could cover this story in a really meaningful way [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1743.8799999999999s)]
*  It will be nick christoph [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1749.1599999999999s)]
*  And so he got engaged and he started a six-month investigation [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1751.1599999999999s)]
*  Of course, he found out exactly what we were saying was happening on the site [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1756.6799999999998s)]
*  I was connecting him with victims as they were coming forward so he could be speaking to victims and whistleblowers [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1761.1599999999999s)]
*  And he ended up releasing [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1766.6s)]
*  this groundbreaking article [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1768.6s)]
*  Called the children of pornhub and it was featuring serena story the girl I just told you about [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1770.9199999999998s)]
*  Flaitis flightus. Yeah serena flightus and many other victims like her who were children abused on the site [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1776.76s)]
*  And had you been meeting? Were more people coming forward at this point was it? Yeah [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1783.72s)]

*  Of pornhub and thankfully attorneys were also coming forward saying we want to help [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1794.04s)]
*  Really amazing hard-hitting top-notch attorneys [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1799.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, you know one of the ones I speak about in my book who um, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1804.28s)]
*  You know he had done the biggest hedge fund insider trading case in history against s.a.c capital and stevie cohen [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1809.48s)]
*  His name is mike bowie from brown retnick and he cared about trafficking and he came forward he became [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1815.3999999999999s)]
*  Serena's attorney and he started representing now. He represents. Um, I think 200 victims [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1821.0s)]
*  Let's bring that hero up bring a picture of him. Yeah, mike bowie. There he is. Yeah mike bowie [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1826.52s)]
*  Yep, thank you mike son of a firefighter wanted to be a firefighter ended up being a he's fighting huge fires now [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1831.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, right. I mean that's one of the biggest fires in the world. It sounds like human trafficking. Yeah taking advantage of people's sexuality. Yeah [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1838.3600000000001s)]
*  So okay back to the story [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1846.3600000000001s)]
*  So nick christoph does this investigate he releases the children of pornhub [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1848.3600000000001s)]
*  And one of the things he does in his article is he calls out the credit card companies [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1852.3600000000001s)]
*  And when this is released, I mean I couldn't believe the impact that it had it started to like thousands of follow-on articles [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1856.6s)]
*  The pressure was on justin trudeau in canada was responding to the article saying how horrific what was going on was [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1863.3999999999999s)]
*  Canadian parliament was up in arms demanding an investigation [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1870.04s)]
*  And the pressure was on the credit card companies and within days of that article being released [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1873.96s)]
*  Visa mastercard and discover join paypal in cutting all ties with pornhub leaving them only with [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1879.08s)]
*  Cryptocurrency as a payment option incredible. This was the worst thing that could happen to pornhub. Okay, right [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1884.92s)]
*  And so they must have lost in a panic. Yeah in an absolute panic [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1891.88s)]
*  This is the worst thing that could happen to them. So they did basically the unthinkable for their business model [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1895.64s)]
*  Which relies on massive amounts of content because content is king for the porn tube sites. You have to understand this that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1902.3600000000001s)]
*  uh, it's about getting [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1909.88s)]
*  Unrestricted massive amounts of content so that they could get picked up in google search results so that they can drive massive amounts of traffic [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1911.94s)]
*  So they can sell all those ad impressions and make hundreds of millions of dollars a year on free porn [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1920.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1925.3200000000002s)]
*  Worst thing they could do is take content down from the site [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1926.2800000000002s)]
*  But they started to delete millions of videos. They deleted 10 million videos and over 30 million images [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1929.16s)]
*  basically in 24 hours [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1936.0400000000002s)]
*  And what financial times called probably the biggest takedown of content in internet history [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1939.0s)]
*  They deleted all of their unverified videos because they had no idea who was a child and like who was 16 and who was 18 [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1943.96s)]
*  right who was [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1951.48s)]
*  Uh, what was rough sex and what was rape? They had no idea what was consensually recorded and non-consensually uploaded, right? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1953.0s)]
*  And so they took down that much content because they're worried about the money [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1961.0s)]
*  Yeah, they wanted to woo the credit card companies back as they said, okay, we have to [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1965.8s)]
*  We have to do this. They basically deleted their site. Uh, they uh, well 80% of it at the time [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1970.2s)]
*  Sadly I found out that so then there's global headlines, right? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1978.04s)]
*  Hundreds of headlines all over the world visa mastercard disc in the big takedown [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1983.08s)]
*  I found out uh an insider came to me months later and said you don't know this [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1987.8s)]
*  But two weeks after the credit card companies disengaged with pornhub [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1993.48s)]
*  They quietly snuck back to the advertising arm of pornhub called traffic junkie because they have their own ad arm, right? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=1997.64s)]
*  And that's how they make most of their money. So business is going on as usual and I said [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2003.8s)]
*  It's like the worst thing that I could have ever I can't believe that this is what happened [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2008.44s)]
*  I said how what are we going to do now? Like how how would a ceo of visa or one of these companies be like [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2013.88s)]
*  Yeah, we're just not going to do this anymore [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2018.92s)]
*  How would they well why wouldn't they just say we would stop this is bad this isn't good, you know is [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2021.88s)]
*  At that point is it because they're also worried about free speech and stuff like that. Do you think or this is not about free speech [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2027.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think I think it has to do with money as well because one thing you have to know is like these are [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2033.3200000000002s)]
*  High-risk transactions. Yeah, they charge more per transaction for high-risk transactions, which are porn transactions [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2038.76s)]
*  I see so there's big money. So there's money, right? Um [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2045.64s)]
*  And they went back and so it was another two-year battle to try to get them to finally disengage which happened [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2049.56s)]
*  uh because serena [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2057.1600000000003s)]
*  sued pornhub not only pornhub she sued its individual owners and its executives and she sued visa [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2059.96s)]
*  For monetizing her abuse. Wow, and she sued the hedge funds [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2068.44s)]
*  For funding the whole enterprise did she win and so what happened was [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2072.9199999999996s)]
*  Visa lost their motion to dismiss the case because they had filed a motion to dismiss they lost it [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2077.56s)]
*  And at the same time we were able to put the pressure on publicly [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2083.72s)]
*  So bill ackman was one of the heroes in this story [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2087.48s)]
*  I mean he knew the ceo of mastercard and so he was making phone calls [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2091.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's bill ackman right there [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2096.04s)]
*  So he got him and I on cmbc squawk box and we called out al kelly who was the ceo of visa [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2097.56s)]
*  For 17 minutes on the show and this was right when visa lost her motion to dismiss [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2104.2s)]
*  So the pressure was on for an emotion to dismiss is what so they say they want to say dismiss the case [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2109.4s)]
*  Dismiss the case we're not involved like this had nothing, you know, nothing we could do about this [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2114.6s)]
*  We're not part of this problem and the court says hold my gavel brother in a damning decision and it wasn't just a [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2119.32s)]
*  Decision it was a like they the judge actually said [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2125.4s)]
*  That visa gave pornhub the very tool through which to complete the crime of benefiting from child trafficking [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2129.64s)]
*  Like those were his words in his decision. Yeah, and so the pressure was on and then so then al kelly [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2136.2000000000003s)]
*  Said he did kind of an unprecedented thing. He was al kelly. He's a ceo visa [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2143.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so the ceo visa al kelly then then he says okay fine [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2148.92s)]
*  We're gonna cut them off once and for all and he made a personal statement [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2152.7599999999998s)]
*  He said i'm a father and I you know don't approve blah blah blah [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2156.2s)]
*  And so we're cutting off pornhub and then of course mastercard quickly followed discover [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2160.04s)]
*  Now they've lost it [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2165.48s)]
*  Totally so and today so we found out they kept deleting content, right? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2167.3199999999997s)]
*  So today they have actually deleted 91 percent of the entire site [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2172.3599999999997s)]
*  So they went from 56 million pieces of content in 2020 when this started to 5.2 million pieces of content today [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2176.44s)]
*  and we're not done because [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2183.4s)]
*  They still have unverified content on the site. Right? So yeah, congratulations [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2185.88s)]
*  That's fast. I mean congratulations [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2191.8s)]
*  Thank you. I mean it's been not just [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2194.1200000000003s)]
*  I I have to pass that on, you know that congratulations to any victims who might be watching this because it's through their courageous [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2197.2400000000002s)]
*  Testimony and then you know stepping forward [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2205.2999999999997s)]
*  it's backlash and [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2209.0s)]
*  You know everybody who's been involved we had 600 organizations that were involved in this and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2211.16s)]
*  The lawyers and the journalists and the whistleblowers and so many people came together to make this happen [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2216.36s)]
*  Did you guys? Um, what was the one c what was the ceo? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2223.3199999999997s)]
*  What was that transaction that kind of occurred where he was like where he reached out the previous ceo? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2227.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2232.2s)]
*  No, he was the owner. So he's a previous owner fabian thilman the zuckerberg of porn fabian thilman [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2233.72s)]
*  Yeah, he reached out in summer 2020 to say he wanted to help [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2239.32s)]
*  And so one of the things that he did was he exposed the secret majority shareholder's name [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2243.72s)]
*  And he said go after the credit card companies [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2248.6s)]
*  As the as the former owner, he said if you want to make a difference here you go after the credit card companies to cut ties [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2251.88s)]
*  um, and so [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2258.84s)]
*  That was now what what I didn't realize at the time. I was suspicious, right? Why is he wanting to help? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2260.52s)]
*  and I kind of later found out that [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2267.08s)]
*  He had intention to try to buy back the company. So he kind of wanted to make a killing again [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2269.88s)]
*  So I think he wanted to help take it down buy it [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2275.16s)]
*  And then find a way to do it back probably with crypto or something on a on a different chain [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2278.68s)]
*  I don't know what he was thinking, but he wanted to buy it back, which I found out later on [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2282.52s)]
*  But the ceo and the ceo coo and the ceo were forced to resign as well [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2287.32s)]
*  And today they're being sued by nearly 300 victims in 25 lawsuits [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2293.1600000000003s)]
*  Including multiple class actions on behalf of tens of thousands of child victims and they're doing amazing in the courts [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2297.6400000000003s)]
*  uh [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2305.0s)]
*  So much more evidence has been uncovered in legal discovery. So discovery is this amazing tool when you engage in a civil lawsuit [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2305.96s)]
*  The the court gives you permission [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2314.44s)]
*  To get behind your opponent so you can get their text messages [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2317.0s)]
*  You can get their emails you can get and so much has come out [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2321.2400000000002s)]
*  of the [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2325.88s)]
*  complicity like you just couldn't believe [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2326.98s)]
*  The things that we've found out just through legal discovery process like what are some of the things like just involved like just okay [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2329.88s)]
*  So here's an example [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2336.28s)]
*  We found out that they only had one person [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2337.96s)]
*  So they had 1800 employees [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2341.3199999999997s)]
*  They hired one person five days a week [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2344.12s)]
*  To be reviewing videos flagged by users as terms of service violations including rape and trafficking and child abuse one [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2347.64s)]
*  person [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2355.3199999999997s)]
*  They had a policy [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2356.36s)]
*  Where they wouldn't even review a video unless it was flagged 15 times now [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2358.68s)]
*  Think about this. You're a victim [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2365.08s)]
*  Say there's a child victim like serena [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2367.08s)]
*  She would have she would have to flag her video over 15 times because it had to be over 15 for it to be reviewed [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2369.24s)]
*  In order for that to even be put in queue [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2375.72s)]
*  For review and they had a backlog of 706 [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2378.7599999999998s)]
*  thousand [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2382.58s)]
*  videos [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2383.7999999999997s)]
*  Um that were just waiting for this one person to review them. Yes, and they had like we've discovered now in a recent [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2385.0s)]
*  filing in december of 2024 [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2391.96s)]
*  We found out specific instances of [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2394.6s)]
*  Pre-pubescent child victims who had their videos on there for years and they would have like 14 flags [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2397.94s)]
*  13 flags [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2404.68s)]
*  And they just like that was the policy and then the ceo and the executives all of this on pornhub. Yes [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2407.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes on pornhub. Yes [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2413.96s)]
*  um, and so i'm just so [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2417.16s)]
*  I'm just grateful that we're having this conversation because I bet [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2419.7999999999997s)]
*  Most the people who are listening to your show had no idea [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2423.96s)]
*  Yeah, that this was happening that it's ever happened that this is an issue on user generated free porn sites [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2427.08s)]
*  and [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2435.08s)]
*  And they keep it up because it's content right like you're saying yeah the more content. Yes content is king, right? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2436.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't want to remove [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2443.24s)]
*  Content because that's how they have inventory [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2445.3199999999997s)]
*  So here's another like egregious example of how they did this was so [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2448.44s)]
*  You know, there's one case that I talk about in my book where there was a case of a clearly pre-pubescent child who is being [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2453.48s)]
*  Anally raped in a video and she is being uh, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2460.7599999999998s)]
*  Tortured the tags on the video. So the type like the titles and tags were describing her abuse that she was young [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2464.44s)]
*  Um that she was being tortured all of this [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2471.3199999999997s)]
*  And we reported the video we tried to get it down weeks go by it's not coming down video view counts going up up up [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2474.2000000000003s)]
*  We reach out to the fbi [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2481.88s)]
*  They demand that it comes down so they connect with the national center on missing and exploited children who confirms this is a child [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2483.88s)]
*  So they demanded the video come down. Okay, and then what they did was they took the video down [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2490.52s)]
*  But they left that black box [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2497.0s)]
*  Up that said removed at the request of the national center for missing and exploited children and they left the url live [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  the tags the titles the views all of that [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2506.44s)]
*  And they did that with [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2510.6s)]
*  so many videos [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2512.28s)]
*  Why would they take the video down? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2514.1200000000003s)]
*  But leave all of that up and it's because it's inventory [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2516.6s)]
*  It's the click. It's the url shows like an ad company that they're going to sell to it still says [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2520.52s)]
*  Well, we have this many videos so you could search that right most videos the tags the titles like they'll draw [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2525.64s)]
*  They'll still come up in google search then you'll get to the site [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2530.92s)]
*  You won't find that particular video, but the algorithm will then direct you to others that are similar [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2534.44s)]
*  And it will advertise to you right? You'll get that those ad views [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2539.64s)]
*  So that's why do you have any victims that showed up to thank you in person like you've had experiences like that kind of yeah [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2544.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I mean i'm still in touch with victims on a regular basis [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2550.04s)]
*  They don't feel though that like justice has fully been served yet. I'm sure so [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2554.44s)]
*  Pornhub was criminally charged [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2559.5600000000004s)]
*  By the u.s federal government in december 2023 for intentionally profiting from sex trafficking [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2562.1200000000003s)]
*  But they're still allowed to stay open [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2568.44s)]
*  but they were offered a deferred prosecution agreement, which is [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2570.6800000000003s)]
*  just unbelievable to me that that happened where [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  Um [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2579.0s)]
*  Basically, they said you pay 1.8 million dollars in a settlement and you have a monitor over your company for three years [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2580.2000000000003s)]
*  And you can get out of going to trial [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2587.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, so that happened but that was related to a case like a specific case of a 100 trafficking victims from california [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2589.7200000000003s)]

*  Oh, it's not I think I mean they've been convicted like his accomplices are in prison [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2659.88s)]
*  And this was in spain. It says it was happening. Why are the laws different? He ran away. So he was a fugitive [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2664.52s)]
*  So he was doing this in san diego. This is where it all happened was in san diego [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2669.2400000000002s)]

*  Their rape and trafficking was finally off of pornhub after fighting for so long [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2893.18s)]

*  Okay to a company that they created themselves to buy pornhub. Okay, and they are called ethical capital partners [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2914.46s)]
*  Wow, what a name [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2922.46s)]

*  They have themselves online [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2929.42s)]
*  You know the the guy that's out there kind of trying to do this whole rebrand of pornhub like we're ethical capital partners [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2930.78s)]
*  His name is solomon freedman and he [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2937.82s)]
*  Is a criminal defense attorney. Is he really a jewish guy from where where is he from? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2941.26s)]

*  So he wants to rebrand just make it more ethical [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2948.78s)]
*  Well, I mean that's what they're saying right they're saying they call themselves ethical capital yet at the same time [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2951.1800000000003s)]
*  the [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2957.9s)]
*  The videos that are on pornhub right now are still [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2958.7000000000003s)]
*  Unverified mostly unverified. So that 5.2 million left [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2963.0s)]
*  They had verified the uploaders, right? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2967.34s)]
*  But not the individuals in the video [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2970.1400000000003s)]
*  So that doesn't work because often the abuser is the uploader and i'll give you an example [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2972.0600000000004s)]
*  So there's a man named rocky shay franklin out of alabama [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2978.54s)]
*  And he drugged and he overpowered and he raped a 12 year old boy [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2982.1400000000003s)]
*  And he filmed those assaults and he uploaded 23 [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2987.02s)]
*  Of those videos to pornhub with titles that indicated this was abuse [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2990.54s)]
*  like young it said like uncle secret, I mean, I won't say the worst things but [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=2995.7400000000002s)]
*  It was clear, right? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3000.94s)]
*  He was put in prison for 40 years [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3003.02s)]
*  For what he did police reached out multiple times to pornhub to try to get those videos down [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3005.58s)]
*  They were ignored for seven months those videos stayed online getting hundreds of thousands of views that boy is suing pornhub today [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3010.46s)]
*  So he's one of those many victims suing pornhub, but rocky was a verified uploader [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3017.74s)]
*  He had shown his id and he they know who he is. They know who he is [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3023.98s)]
*  But they didn't verify clearly right like who's in the video [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3028.06s)]
*  Right. So even today [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3031.98s)]
*  You know as of 2024 pornhub had to produce a report [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3034.46s)]
*  They sent it into the european. There's a european law called the digital services act [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3038.38s)]
*  And in 2024 in four and a half months, they had to take down [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3043.7400000000002s)]
*  3770 [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3047.96s)]
*  child sexual abuse videos from the site and over 8 000 [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3049.88s)]
*  Non-consensual and rape videos from the site. Okay, so they're having to be legally asked to do this, right? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3054.38s)]
*  Yeah, well to disclose what they're doing so that's all under ethical capital partners, right? Okay, so that's [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3060.54s)]
*  You know they do so ethical capital partners. There's still there's still stuff out there. That's not supposed to be there [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3067.5800000000004s)]
*  Yes, they still haven't actually implemented the preventative policies. What's ethical about it? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3072.94s)]
*  It's just a farce. I mean, it's just uh, you know, and that's why I think it's so important to [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3077.98s)]
*  Sound the alarm on this rebrand because from a victim's perspective like this is also a miscarriage of justice [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3083.34s)]
*  for them to go out there and try to [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3089.5800000000004s)]
*  Resuscitate pornhub's brand to say over ethical capital listen the same men who made all those decisions [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3092.2000000000003s)]
*  That the one person that was verifying videos they had 30 moderators [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3098.86s)]
*  30 moderators moderating the millions of videos on pornhub now compare that with facebook's [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3103.98s)]
*  15 000 moderators and they still don't have enough these moderators they were viewing [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3110.44s)]
*  Between eight hundred and two thousand videos per shift clicking through those videos with the sound off just clicking through them [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3115.6600000000003s)]

*  And putting a employee through that well I and i've spoken to those and some of those employees [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3143.9799999999996s)]

*  But he needed the money [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3172.14s)]
*  Um, and he was abused as a child. He was sexually abused as a child [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3174.14s)]
*  Wow, so it was especially hard for him to do this [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3177.74s)]
*  But I think that's why he went and did it [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3181.3399999999997s)]
*  It's like you could find something else to do probably I mean not calling him out [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3183.8199999999997s)]

*  And they guess wrong all the time. They were skipping through two thousand, you know thousands of videos per shift [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3203.4199999999996s)]

*  So they're still running they're just trying to rebuild this company and still make money well, so I mean [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3261.12s)]
*  What i'm saying is like ethical capital right if they were coming in and saying like we're gonna rebrand we're gonna do this new thing [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3265.44s)]
*  Why would you still have the same men responsible for the decisions that destroy the lives of countless victims just running the site today? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3271.44s)]
*  That's why it's like right. It's just a farce like it's not real. Yeah, and even if it was real [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3278.08s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they escape justice being fully served [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3284.88s)]
*  because [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3289.36s)]
*  What's important is? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3290.7999999999997s)]
*  victims receive the justice they need for healing [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3292.56s)]
*  And to be a deterrent to future abusers like one of the most things most important things in the fight against trafficking [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3297.2s)]
*  Is not just to rescue victims right and to rehabilitate them that's important [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3303.54s)]
*  But to prevent it from happening in the future and how do you prevent it? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3307.3s)]
*  You have to increase risk [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3311.14s)]
*  And eliminate profitability you have to make the risk of continued exploitation greater than the benefit that these executives get by maintaining the status quo [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3313.14s)]
*  And then when you do that and you end impunity for these abusers you become a deterrent to future abusers because [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3322.1s)]
*  That little part to me again so so you want to [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3328.58s)]
*  Hold these companies fully accountable to the full extent of the law to me [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3331.86s)]
*  That means pornhub gets shut down like we go from 91 percent to 100 percent [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3336.42s)]
*  They do not exist anymore because they have been destroying the lives of countless victims since 2007 when they came online [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3341.3s)]
*  And when that happens other websites owned by other executives will say we don't want to end up in that position [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3348.34s)]
*  So let's just clean ourselves up because we can make a lot of money on legal content, right? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3354.9s)]
*  We don't have to monetize illegal content. We can [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3359.86s)]
*  Do this in a way where we're not distributing sexual crime and they'll do that because they want to avoid losing the credit card companies [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3363.22s)]
*  They want to avoid litigation. They want to avoid criminal just greed at a certain point is some type of it's a risk [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3370.02s)]
*  It's risk benefit, right? But a sickness too to think that you would be able to know that that's happening, right? Right and keep going [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3375.7s)]
*  That's it's like what type of sickness exists, you know, I mean it's [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3383.46s)]
*  It's almost like a hell. You're like you're like a slave trader of people's [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3389.14s)]
*  um [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3394.02s)]
*  Like solitude and and and peace, you know, but no, you know, I don't know I just can't I can't I can't even [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3396.98s)]
*  I can't imagine that I can't fathom that someone would be like, yeah, this is okay [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3405.3s)]
*  I'm not gonna that that's not gonna be the first thing i'm gonna worry about with my company, right? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3409.06s)]
*  Yeah, so so just i'm just fine tuning to my my view here. So a lot of your [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3412.98s)]
*  Combativeness is not against pornography [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3419.76s)]
*  it's against the [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3423.46s)]
*  sex trafficking the [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3426.5s)]
*  Like people illegally filming people filming drugs people no verification of age all of these crimes basically [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3428.98s)]
*  Yeah, sexual crime being distributed online [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3435.62s)]
*  In fact some of the most helpful allies in this fight have been those in the porn industry [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3438.6600000000003s)]
*  like at one point, you know, I had um [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3443.7000000000003s)]
*  Those who were producing their own porn on pornhub and they were doing this in a professional sense [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3447.0600000000004s)]
*  And they were reaching out to me because they said listen [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3452.82s)]
*  We need to take this company down because i'm sick and tired of spending two hours a day [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3455.5400000000004s)]
*  Scouring pornhub and its sister tube sites trying to get my own stolen illegal content off the site because they were [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3460.4s)]
*  Not only rape and trafficking, right? This is copyright infringement content like there's no protection for that either [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3466.34s)]
*  No, they're just uploading they're just pirating and uploading all of this content. So so those in the porn industry kind of hated mind geek already [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3472.6600000000003s)]
*  Because the free porn tube sites were exploiting the legally produced content of these [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3480.7400000000002s)]
*  Those in the industry. Yeah, because even with youtube there's like there's like meta data and stuff that they could if they want to they can [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3486.5s)]
*  Make sure that someone can't do it without it being claimed or known, you know, right? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3493.38s)]
*  And so well they could do these dmca takedowns. So that's what they would do [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3497.14s)]
*  So she was spending hours a day multiple right doing that but as she was doing that she was coming across [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3500.26s)]
*  Child abuse rape trafficking and then they were sending the links and that was one of the things that was crazy that was happening [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3507.7000000000003s)]
*  Is that as this was all going viral and there's all these stories people around the world who are on pornhub? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3514.42s)]
*  Who would find an illegal video would be sending it to me and so I was in and so it was just kind of a really intense [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3520.34s)]
*  Right, because then you're looking at it seeing what's going on. You're like, what am I supposed to do? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3529.3s)]
*  And then I have the responsibility to report it to you know, take care of [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3532.58s)]
*  You know witnessing what's happening and then trying to help how tremendous i mean insane, huh? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3537.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's yeah, I mean, yeah, it's real [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3543.78s)]
*  It's so this is all real vile real stuff that was happening and being uploaded. Yeah [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3546.7400000000002s)]
*  Real real sexual crime. So so what do you think kind of like the solution is at scale? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3551.78s)]
*  You know when you think about that lila. Yeah [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3556.34s)]
*  well [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3559.38s)]
*  So yes, it's one thing to hold one particular company accountable and that's important [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3560.42s)]
*  But the question then becomes because pornhub is not alone, right? I want everybody to understand [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3564.34s)]
*  That it's not like you go. Okay. Well x videos must be fine [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3569.54s)]
*  They're a free user generated porn site that was operating in a similar way of not verifying agent consent [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3573.4599999999996s)]
*  And there's you nick christoph did an investigation and found you know reported on the victims who were on x videos and there's x hamster [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3579.3799999999997s)]
*  And there's all of these of x and xx right and there's others that operate in a similar way [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3586.3399999999997s)]
*  And so the question is well, how do we stop this across all of these sites, right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3591.9399999999996s)]
*  and that goes back to [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3597.06s)]
*  The source of the problem is not verifying agent consent. We have to demand [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3599.14s)]
*  Third party agent consent verification for every single person in every single video that is uploaded to a user generated porn site [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3604.98s)]
*  And when that happens, we're going to make a huge difference in stopping that illegal content from being uploaded [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3613.2999999999997s)]
*  But that's a huge task, right? So it's not just governments who have to do this because this is an international problem [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3620.1s)]
*  These sites operate internationally. So if the u.s does that well, they're still in canada and they're in you know, every country in the world [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3626.42s)]
*  So the solution at scale becomes the credit card companies implementing that policy because we know they're highly motivated by money [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3632.98s)]
*  And if visa says we don't do business with user generated porn sites that don't verify the agent consent of every person every video [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3641.3s)]
*  Well, all of these companies are going to comply and they're going to do it quickly. So that's the solution [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3649.78s)]
*  So how do we because you would think at this point they would just go on ahead and say that because it's like [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3654.66s)]
*  it's obviously the next [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3659.86s)]
*  Right thing to do right and as in a moral sense it would feel like well a lot of companies don't [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3661.94s)]
*  Operate from right business doesn't have uh emotions. Well, yeah, and it comes from [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3668.5s)]
*  Pressure, right? And so that's where I see the litigation being important where these survivors dozens [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3674.1s)]
*  Of survivors who have sued the credit card companies, right? So now they're facing some of it, right? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3679.7000000000003s)]
*  Right, so they're feeling that pressure and at some point they go listen. It's better business [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3684.26s)]
*  To just let it go implement this policy just like we have anti money laundering policy [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3689.6200000000003s)]
*  We're going to have anti online sexual exploitation policy [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3694.5s)]
*  And we just don't do business with user generated porn sites that don't verify agent consent because it's too risky for us, right? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3697.6200000000003s)]
*  Right, because then yeah, it hits their wallet without any exactly they're losing like big pharma. It's like, you know litigation made a huge difference in [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3703.86s)]
*  Reform in in the pharmaceutical industry [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3711.46s)]
*  We saw in the hedge fund insider trading cases when they had big litigation and criminal prosecution and it forced those changes to happen [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3714.3399999999997s)]
*  So I think that could be [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3721.3799999999997s)]
*  Uh, that's where we're hoping to get to next. Yeah, that's where we need to go [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3724.1s)]
*  And who supports legally supports you guys's um, like the legal costs. Yeah [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3727.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's where I mean these firms a lot of them are working on a contingency basis where you know, they're working with victims [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3732.2599999999998s)]
*  Some do pro bono [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3738.98s)]
*  They have like different kinds of arrangements and then we support victims as well at the justice defense fund [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3740.58s)]
*  To help them get connected to lawyers to support them along that journey [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3746.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a hard thing to do to take on [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3751.3s)]
*  An abuser it's hard thing to go into litigation and they need you know therapy advocacy [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3754.42s)]
*  like all the ways that they need to be supported and so [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3759.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's our mission is to support survivors to pursue justice in court to get that healing and to implement those [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3763.94s)]
*  Preventative policies to make sure it doesn't happen again now mastercard has come a lot like a little ways [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3771.68s)]
*  So they implemented a policy where they say [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3777.86s)]
*  You have to verify uploaders, but that's not far enough. Like you have to verify [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3780.66s)]
*  Those in the videos. Yeah [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3785.46s)]
*  So and do you think there's like backroom dealings between my between these companies and the like [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3788.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh credit card companies where they're like sending them extra cash or meet, you know, like they just know each other [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3793.6200000000003s)]
*  The owners know each other and it's like we'll let you stay open that type of thing. I haven't seen that [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3798.82s)]
*  I don't I don't I haven't seen that happen. I don't get that sense. I think that you know, this is just one of many [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3802.82s)]
*  Industries that they can make money on and they will maintain that position [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3809.92s)]
*  Yeah, I just wonder if there's lobbying by the actual owners of the companies towards the um [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3815.46s)]
*  Towards the credit card companies, you know other banks possible [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3821.7s)]
*  You start to figure that that's where a lot of things really kind of happen [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3825.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, um, and then it bubbles up to the surface of what we can follow the money what we can see. Yeah [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3828.74s)]
*  Um, what what state because i've noticed like, you know, i've watched pornography before i've had issues with um [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3834.34s)]
*  Um pornography addiction kind of or I just I use it as an escape like especially in my 20s like um [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3841.06s)]
*  You know, I found pornography when I was you know at a at a age where I was probably maybe 13 or 14 [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3848.18s)]
*  And so then I would use it to make me feel good [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3854.02s)]
*  It was like one of the only ways I felt like when I was young that I could feel good [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3855.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, I had really low self uh worth and so once I realized pornography [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3859.62s)]
*  And porno and everything I was like, oh dang I can control. I have a control [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3864.98s)]
*  Basically lever on my body as to how when I can feel okay, right? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3869.54s)]
*  and so [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3873.78s)]
*  Um, it was magazines and then I guess as staying, you know, then it became like video online stuff like that, you know [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3875.14s)]
*  over time [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3881.86s)]
*  Um, but it certainly has been something where it's like I don't feel good about myself. I feel down about myself [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3883.22s)]
*  What's the one way I know to feel good and would be to uh, watch pornography, you know, or use it to masturbate [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3888.5s)]
*  You know things like that to make myself and then you get a you get a hit of dopamine [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3894.58s)]
*  crazily and so then you part of you feels good for a while, you know, um, so that's been [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3898.74s)]
*  You know, that was kind of my story with it except it got to it got to like I would notice [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3904.66s)]
*  instead of going and meeting girls or trying to like like [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3909.86s)]
*  well part of my spirit started to suffer because I was taking out like a important part of like my soul and my physiology by [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3913.7s)]
*  ejaculating or like [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3921.84s)]
*  just like [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3923.78s)]
*  Abusing that part of me and it then I didn't have [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3925.0400000000004s)]
*  You know, I think that part of you supposed to kind of build up inside of you and help you have like some [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3928.7400000000002s)]
*  Um, it pushes you to talk to women and to want to go on dates and things like that [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3932.5800000000004s)]
*  And so for me, I think it started to weaken some of that over time [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3937.3s)]
*  It was like well, why go meet a girl or ask a girl out when I could just masturbate, you know, that was some fun [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3940.1000000000004s)]
*  Uh, that was kind of what happened. I guess in my head at sometimes yeah, um, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3947.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and i've been in like recovery groups to talk about that, you know, i'm in recovery groups where there's like [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3951.54s)]
*  Multiple things that people have dealt with, you know a lot of for me has just been like intimacy stuff [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3956.74s)]
*  You know because if you're looking at pornography it creates it [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3961.14s)]
*  It skews the way you look at intimacy because you start to think of like sexual activity just in like frames and certain [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3964.66s)]
*  um [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3971.86s)]
*  like [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3973.22s)]
*  You don't really think of connection because you don't see a lot of connection in porn [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3974.42s)]
*  You know, it's not like you watch a 45 minute porn and it's people two people getting to know each other [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3977.62s)]
*  You know at a park or something, you know [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3983.14s)]
*  so or splitting a diet soda or something so it's like [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3985.54s)]
*  You know that part is all you know things get super I think things get kind of convoluted in your psyche sometimes [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3989.14s)]
*  Well, yeah, and it's driven by an algorithm now. It's like right, you know, it's people's sexual preferences and their their sexuality [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=3996.02s)]
*  In today, you know this internet porn saturated world that's driven by an algorithm the algorithm is driven by [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4004.68s)]
*  executives who want to get as many views and clicks [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4011.86s)]
*  um and add impressions as possible and then you know, that's kind of shaping the content that's being seen on the sites and [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4014.68s)]
*  What's especially? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4023.4s)]
*  Alarming to me and you know, it's what you experienced right because you when you were 13 years old [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4025.88s)]
*  When you were first exposed to porn is that children, you know are just en masse being exposed to not [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4031.7999999999997s)]
*  Playboy, right? Not the centerfold [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4040.12s)]
*  that used to be but [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4043.08s)]
*  the free porn tube sites because [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4045.72s)]
*  You know, it's free. It's just [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4048.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you guys know that children are accessing those like is there is there statistics behind it? Oh, yeah [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4050.68s)]
*  I mean, you know [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4055.16s)]
*  I think you know one study from 2022 was saying that 75 percent of 13 to 17 year olds have viewed internet porn [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4056.12s)]
*  I mean, I think would probably be more than that in this [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4063.4s)]
*  Every kid has a device, you know, there's five year olds that could click through the internet filters are not doing a good job [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4066.52s)]
*  and you know parents who [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4073.24s)]
*  You know may not even know how to implement [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4075.7999999999997s)]
*  Internet filters for their kids and even if they do you know, they can't control all the time [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4078.7599999999998s)]
*  So they can't be you know at school and you know other places when they go to their friend's house or whatever [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4083.08s)]
*  It's just what filters are they using? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4088.52s)]
*  Are you are they because they're the ones that you suggest kind of that people use? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4090.2s)]
*  Um, I don't have any particular brands that I would suggest but you know [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4093.48s)]
*  There's like so many different apps that people can install you can get like routers that could actually block [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4096.68s)]
*  The content at the router level. Oh, that's awesome. I didn't know that [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4102.52s)]
*  Yeah, and so there's stuff like that out there [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4105.56s)]
*  But I know states are stopping people from like a lot of states are pro you have to upload an [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4107.88s)]
*  Id now well, there's like this whole movement in the united states right now [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4113.46s)]
*  That is saying look we understand that kids are accessing this content and we want to protect kids from [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4117.8s)]
*  viewing and I call it um a form of secondhand sexual abuse right for kids [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4125.62s)]
*  To be witnessing this kind of content and from my perspective. I know how much of this content isn't just [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4132.04s)]
*  Hardcore, right? It's actually criminal right where they could be watching [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4138.839999999999s)]
*  Um a real rape as their sex education as an eight-year-old child [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4143.879999999999s)]
*  And you know, they call it the creation of a sexual template, right? So it becomes like what is your sexuality? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4148.44s)]
*  About and what is you know arousing to you? And if they grow up on this kind of content? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4155.879999999999s)]
*  I mean it could do so much damage to an entire generation [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4162.28s)]
*  Well, especially I think it's all I think a lot of that's already happened [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4165.959999999999s)]
*  I think you've seen like the a lot of the effects of pornography on um [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4168.36s)]
*  You know marriages like, you know, people get addicted to porn and then they're no longer. Um [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4173.0s)]
*  expressing attraction of their spouse and uh [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4177.879999999999s)]
*  Because it's being hijacked basically by this algorithm by the by the websites by this addiction and then marriages fall apart [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4180.919999999999s)]
*  And then families fall apart. Yeah, and another implication of this is actually children who are acting out on other children [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4187.32s)]
*  So we've seen [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4194.44s)]
*  um, so I was just reading [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4195.88s)]
*  Uh the amicus should call amicus briefs. So these are briefs that were submitted to the supreme court. So [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4198.28s)]
*  As these states across america are implementing age verification to protect kids from viewing [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4204.599999999999s)]
*  porn online [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4211.32s)]
*  Um, the porn sites are not happy about this so porn hub and its um partners are suing those states [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4213.4s)]
*  so for example, they sued the state of texas to not have to [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4221.08s)]
*  Abide by this age verification law and it's gone now. They've appealed it. They lost they appealed now [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4225.08s)]
*  It's at the supreme court and on january 15 [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4230.5199999999995s)]
*  The justice has actually heard oral arguments for whether or not we can have states [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4234.5199999999995s)]
*  Enacting age verification to keep kids off porn sites [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4241.16s)]
*  So they're going to have a decision by june [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4244.36s)]
*  But some of the briefs submitted are so compelling and one of them was this nurse heidi olson [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4245.799999999999s)]

*  of sexual assault that she had to [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4259.719999999999s)]
*  document and assess and she saw that 50 percent of those cases were children who were assaulting [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4262.339999999999s)]
*  other children [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4269.959999999999s)]
*  Uh, and the the number one, um, the perpetrators in that group were 14 year old males [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4271.32s)]
*  Who were then assaulting females other females? Yeah children and you're saying that a lot you think and they're citing pornography [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4278.04s)]
*  as being the reason why they're [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4285.0s)]
*  acting out right because [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4288.04s)]

*  um and teen right like teen could be [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4377.4800000000005s)]
*  18 and 19, but it also is 13 and 14 and 15 and 16 [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4381.0s)]
*  And so many of that those videos are you know where they could be someone who's of age [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4385.88s)]
*  But they're intentionally made to look [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4392.28s)]
*  Under age with the pigtails and the flat chests and the braces and the no no makeup and all of that and they're [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4394.92s)]
*  You mixed in with videos of real [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4401.16s)]
*  Teenagers who are being abused and then this is being pushed, right? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4403.86s)]
*  It's one of the they were you know Pornhub was tracking down to the dollar how much they would make monthly on those teen [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4407.16s)]
*  Categories on their site and it was one of you know, one of the most popular [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4415.14s)]
*  That they had and so whatever is making the most money you push that forward, right? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4419.64s)]
*  And so maybe it's they're getting more clicks because people are like [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4423.8s)]
*  horrified by it or maybe you know, I I don't know, you know exactly what [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4427.38s)]
*  Um is happening there but whatever it is that gets the most clicks and views they they'll push the algorithm, right? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4431.719999999999s)]
*  We'll of course push that forward [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4437.48s)]
*  But it's like why why I wonder how that even starts if they say like mom son porn [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4439.48s)]
*  You know i'm saying like where does something like that demand like that idea even start? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4444.44s)]
*  Well, I think it's so i've spoken to some porn producers who've talked to me about this and the way that there's been like a trajectory [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4449.719999999999s)]
*  from [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4457.4s)]
*  Like playboy into more and more kind of extreme forms of [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4458.36s)]
*  porn in different situations or and they're you know saying like they're just told to create the most [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4463.639999999999s)]
*  Extreme thing you can think of because you you need more shock value. There's this [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4469.7s)]
*  idea of [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4475.639999999999s)]
*  You know kind of desensitization for people where they want to kind of in order to get the same dopamine hit [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4477.24s)]
*  With porn it's not necessarily that you need more is that you need different and you need something [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4484.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah more extreme to kind of get that same dopamine hit. What does porn do to our brains? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4492.200000000001s)]
*  Do you have anything on that? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4497.08s)]
*  Trying to see just the psychological effects new research sheds light on the global impact of problematic pornography use [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4498.84s)]
*  Okay, i'll look at this a little bit [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4505.160000000001s)]
*  But after this I want something more about the actual effects of on our brain [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4506.360000000001s)]
*  A comprehensive international study involving tens of thousands of participants from dozens of countries suggest that problematic pornography use [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4510.12s)]
*  Might have a prevalence rate as high as 16.6 percent. So that's saying that 16.6 percent of people [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4516.4400000000005s)]
*  Per this study have problematic pornography use [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4524.04s)]
*  problematic [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4527.8s)]
*  Pornography use refers to a condition where individuals and experience an uncontrollable urge to consume pornography [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4529.320000000001s)]
*  Leading to significant distress or impairment in their daily [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4535.240000000001s)]
*  functioning [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4538.68s)]
*  First most people use pornography, but only a small group of them develop problems with it [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4540.04s)]
*  So we wanted to see how many people may experience such problems worldwide and whether there are any country gender or sexual orientation based [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4544.12s)]
*  Differences as most previous studies focused on really specific populations i.e [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4551.22s)]
*  men from the united states [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4556.84s)]
*  I think one of the most important takeaway messages from our study is that problematic pornography use seems to be as common [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4559.0s)]
*  As other mental health issues i.e depression [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4564.92s)]
*  So we need to better understand this problem and provide appropriate care for people experiencing this this issue [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4568.040000000001s)]
*  Probably the most surprising finding of the study is that only four to ten percent of individuals with problematic pornography [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4574.200000000001s)]
*  Saw it help for this issue with an additional 20 to 40 percent one wanting to but did not do so for various help reasons [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4580.200000000001s)]
*  Well part of that is shame, right? And that's why I am so grateful [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4588.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm sure so many of your listeners are grateful that you talk about it [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4592.68s)]
*  Oh, well, i'll say this i'll say this exactly and specifically when I um [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4595.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, we actually a friend of mine [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4601.4800000000005s)]
*  Started a a program called valor recovery and it's for porn addiction [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4603.8s)]
*  And I know I met this guy in different recovery meetings and he's a friend of mine [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4610.360000000001s)]
*  and so i'll go to the meetings and um [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4614.4400000000005s)]
*  and i'm excited to go to the meetings and i'm helping we're helping kind of work to [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4618.200000000001s)]
*  Try and make this thing bigger right to make it bigger and one of the things I noticed when I took [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4622.2s)]
*  When I had the most time I ever had off of pornography the shame I had [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4629.32s)]
*  Disappeared oh [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4634.259999999999s)]
*  There was still some shame at certain moments [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4635.879999999999s)]
*  But it I was able to finally notice it because before I'd just been in this circle of shame [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4638.36s)]
*  Because I would masturbate I would feel ashamed of myself. I would start to feel a little bit better. Um [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4643.24s)]
*  But I would be like had some [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4649.24s)]
*  But then when I needed to [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4652.12s)]
*  When I needed to feel okay when if I started to feel a little shaker needed to feel okay again [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4653.639999999999s)]
*  I would be right back to the pornography and then the shame, you know the shame of it cycle [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4657.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it was and I didn't realize I I was stuck in it probably for a decade [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4662.679999999999s)]
*  I was still going dates and being relationship stuff, but it ruined a lot of are you like free today from that? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4666.5199999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't say i'm free, but i'm definitely on parole. Yeah [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4671.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, you know what i'm saying? Like it's a different [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4674.84s)]
*  uh [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4678.4400000000005s)]
*  I have tools and stuff now in place to like battle against it and um [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4680.12s)]
*  So what helped you the most to going to meetings recovery 12 step recovery? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4686.04s)]
*  Community community. Yeah getting in groups and you'll start to see in groups [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4691.54s)]
*  I've been in groups where men at first came [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4694.92s)]
*  Were scared even talk like in the groups and then like three months later [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4697.08s)]
*  You see that like their wife has moved back in they're spending time with their kids [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4700.28s)]
*  They're not watching pornography. They're not acting out in these certain ways with um, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4704.36s)]
*  you know, uh escorts and uh [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4708.679999999999s)]
*  Prostitutes and all of that but the biggest thing I noticed for myself was shame [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4711.219999999999s)]
*  I just noticed that it started to disappear because I'd always had this heavy shame [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4714.679999999999s)]
*  And I'd never really noticed that it could have had to do with um [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4718.679999999999s)]
*  Really the masturbate just the part of like if I need to make myself feel good, then i'll use masturbation, you know [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4722.44s)]
*  um, do you think that there's I mean could be like [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4727.88s)]
*  Two sides to shame right shame could be really destructive and unhealthy [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4730.6s)]
*  because it causes you not to [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4734.84s)]
*  Seek help or get community or be able to talk about it [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4737.16s)]
*  And so then you push push the problem down and then it becomes then you know worse, right because then you're trying to [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4739.8s)]
*  Alleviate that pain. Okay. Say it one more time for me. So, you know [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4747.32s)]
*  Could the shame have two sides to it where there's kind of like a healthy shame where it's pricking [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4750.76s)]
*  Pricking your conscience and saying like this is not who I am [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4756.2s)]
*  I can do better than this and it inspires you to [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4759.08s)]
*  Overcome, but then there's the other side of shame which keeps people kind of hiding it pushing it down [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4763.320000000001s)]
*  Not be not being able to get community not being able to talk about it [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4768.84s)]
*  Which then could cause the problem to be worse, right? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4772.4400000000005s)]
*  For me, yeah [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4776.04s)]
*  That I agreed both of those things can happen [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4777.24s)]
*  I think some of them kind of happen at certain moments for me [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4779.8s)]
*  But I think overall it was just I didn't want to be doing it anymore. Yeah, and I kept doing it [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4782.12s)]
*  Yeah, and so for then it was just constant like um [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4787.48s)]
*  Like I don't have any willpower. Yeah, and so that made me ashamed of myself [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4791.88s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't it sometimes the act itself would like definitely like I would watch pornography on the computers or something [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4795.8s)]
*  And I would immediately close it. Did you ever feel like you were encountering? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4801.4s)]
*  Potentially non-consensual content when I never felt like I was I never felt like I saw anything like that [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4806.26s)]
*  Yeah, but I do think that I've this is how I've long I've long thought this [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4812.04s)]
*  I believe because sometimes you see like a lot of like people get compromised, right? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4816.759999999999s)]
*  it seems like a lot of times in our society that [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4821.96s)]
*  uh [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4824.839999999999s)]
*  like [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4826.36s)]
*  Freedom seekers are people that want to change the status quo that want to like rise up and do something different at some point [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4827.4s)]
*  Some of them get it feels like maybe they get compromised in their [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4832.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know if money hits them or there's some opportunity that's presented to them [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4837.16s)]
*  This is all this is a lot of conspiracy temple hat stuff [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4840.5199999999995s)]
*  But and then they change their tune or their tune weekends or their goal their agenda like kind of curbs a little bit [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4844.04s)]
*  And you think oh somebody got to them [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4850.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that a lot of these sites [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4853.08s)]
*  Record somehow secretly these days can record the user watching porn [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4856.5s)]
*  And so then that they are able to use that against [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4861.5599999999995s)]
*  Users like say like because I think everybody's probably watched some type of pornography maybe I don't know everybody that I know [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4866.58s)]
*  Has watched it [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4873.5599999999995s)]
*  But I would guess anyway, like if you had a tickle in them be like tell me if you watched it [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4875.08s)]
*  They would do they would admit it. But um [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4878.28s)]
*  But that's what I've always thought i'm like man. I bet some people it's like they use that that's something like [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4881.719999999999s)]
*  because you always wonder what's that tool that like [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4885.96s)]
*  once people get like [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4888.84s)]
*  Some power or something that what's the tool that they use to keep them down and it would either be like well [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4890.84s)]
*  We're gonna assassinate you or we have this video of you masturbating them [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4895.08s)]
*  That would be like oh it's too much shame for me to handle, you know [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4899.4s)]
*  And even if it doesn't actually happen the fear of that, right? Yeah [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4902.6s)]
*  That'd be a risky card to say, you know what? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4907.24s)]
*  I'm not gonna call your bluff. That'd be crazy, you know [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4909.24s)]
*  Well, there is where some of the opposition to user age verifications coming from probably [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4911.16s)]
*  From users who are afraid that they are going to have to identify themselves [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4917.72s)]
*  When they're going to those sites [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4923.0s)]
*  but I would assure people like that is actually not a real fear in this situation because [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4924.36s)]
*  We have ways now with technology and there's third party companies. So I would never [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4931.0s)]
*  want anybody to actually have to give their id to pornhub because [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4936.2s)]
*  I would never trust them in a million years with that content because they exploit [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4941.5599999999995s)]
*  Data like they're being sued right now in a class action for data exploitation [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4945.48s)]
*  You know, they gather so much information already sell it to people they sell it to advertisers [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4949.639999999999s)]
*  So like when you go to pornhub, you think that it's all private, right? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4953.48s)]
*  And but they're gathering like the ip address they can find out your zip code from your zip code [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4957.0s)]
*  They probably find your income level. They're looking at your sexual preferences. They're determining if you're a you know, a male or a female [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4962.52s)]
*  You know what language you speak what browser you use. I mean they're gathering so much information [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4970.2s)]
*  About everybody. Yeah, and so there's that [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4976.360000000001s)]
*  But there's third party companies that can verify age [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4980.28s)]
*  Safely effectively with respecting privacy. In fact, they don't even have to actually take your image [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4985.160000000001s)]
*  So it's biometric scanning. So there's a company called yoti where they actually will in one second they can [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4991.64s)]
*  Determine your age 99 over 99 accuracy with a facial scan using ai that's trained on you know [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=4998.02s)]
*  Thousands or millions of images and so and they just look at pixels and numbers [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5005.160000000001s)]
*  They don't actually even store the actual image of your face, right? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5009.72s)]
*  And then they erase that so [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5013.639999999999s)]
*  That's you know, that's how they can verify [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5016.2s)]
*  So anybody who wants to oppose age verification for the reason of privacy concerns, which is what pornhub is shutting itself down [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5019.0s)]
*  In states across the united states right now [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5027.16s)]
*  They're they're shutting themselves down in opposition to age verification [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5031.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. Okay. So they're saying instead of having people verify their age to watch we would rather shut ourselves down [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5035.88s)]
*  Yes, because it costs them money and we have their because they have to hire a third party company to verify exactly [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5042.12s)]
*  They're not allowed to age verify. Well, I mean, it's not that they're not allowed to I don't think that they can and I don't [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5047.72s)]
*  And I don't think anybody would ever want to like hand their id over to pornhub [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5053.24s)]
*  So there's this third party sites that have that technology that can at scale [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5058.52s)]
*  You know verify so they're used by meta tick tock, you know other um companies who do this, but they're saying oh [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5063.32s)]
*  It's too much. It's not cost effective anymore. They're saying like pornhub is out there in the media saying [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5069.16s)]
*  We're protesting we're shutting ourselves down because we care about user privacy because we don't want people handing over their personal [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5074.92s)]
*  That's a lie. They care about your user privacy. Then they would care about protecting people who were [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5081.0s)]
*  Un-un-non consenting right? Yeah, but that's the most privacy. It's the most but not only that [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5087.0s)]
*  It's like the same company also runs pay sites that are collecting credit card information, right with your name [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5092.2s)]
*  Your you know when you put in your billing address your credit card details, so it's all it's all a facade [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5098.5199999999995s)]
*  It's all just a facade [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5104.04s)]
*  And so that's why I think it's important for people to know the truth about what is the opposition to age verification [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5105.16s)]
*  What is what's really going on behind the scenes here? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5111.4s)]
*  And it's really about money and we even have their senior community manager [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5114.28s)]
*  Who you know publicly admitted in a reddit thread? She was having conversation and she says [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5118.599999999999s)]
*  Um age verification would basically devastate their traffic and it costs us money to verify [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5123.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's why it would be a disaster for them is because it costs them money [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5130.36s)]
*  And so that's really what this is about. It's about money [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5134.12s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5136.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5136.84s)]
*  When people say that like how do you respond to that argument that people say like oh we are this that you're limiting freedom of speech, right? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5136.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean I would just well from the or responsibility of the person right? So both of those things maybe [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5143.08s)]
*  Well, there's two sides so there's you know [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5149.08s)]
*  So we're talking about those who are in the videos and then we're talking about who's viewing the videos and [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5150.92s)]
*  I would just you know over and over and this has been judges have said this too. It's like, you know [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5155.400000000001s)]
*  Child sexual abuse is not an expression. It's not [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5159.64s)]
*  An idea like rape's not an idea like these are actual crimes as contraband being distributed [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5162.84s)]
*  So anybody that's saying that fuck them really? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5168.84s)]
*  Basically to be honest because it's just a mess. It's like what are you saying here? You're saying that [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5171.72s)]
*  Because if you know that these sites are doing that now and then you're then you can't really argue freedom of speech for them [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5176.200000000001s)]
*  Because they're not speech, right? It's not speech, right? Right. In fact, it's the fact that somebody can't speak up for themselves [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5182.6s)]
*  Right and even when people do [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5188.4400000000005s)]
*  They have to be videos have to be flagged so many times or they don't have proper people in place to help those people [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5190.52s)]
*  Who are trying to speak up for themselves? Right? Yeah, so that um, so there's that on that side [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5195.96s)]
*  But then on the other side, you know, they're they're trying to argue this is limiting free speech, right? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5200.92s)]
*  for [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5205.5599999999995s)]
*  us to implement age verification [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5206.5199999999995s)]
*  And again, it's like no, you know [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5208.759999999999s)]
*  This is not limiting anybody's ability to access this content or anybody's ability to express themselves on these sites [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5211.16s)]
*  It's simply like a one second age verification [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5218.2s)]
*  Biometric scan using you know the safest, you know privacy protection that you can [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5221.86s)]
*  um, and it's no different than if you go into [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5228.599999999999s)]
*  A physical store and they're selling alcohol or right and then the bartender would do like [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5232.280000000001s)]
*  You know look at you and determine do I think that they're of age or not? Let me see your id [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5238.6s)]
*  Take a moment. Make sure you're an adult [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5243.64s)]
*  And on your way like that doesn't restrict [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5246.12s)]
*  Uh somebody's ability to get what they want [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5249.8s)]
*  They still can go in the bar and they can get the alcohol anybody can still go to a porn site and access porn if they want [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5252.76s)]
*  To they just have to take these few steps in between and it helps keep it out of the hands of children [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5258.04s)]
*  If a kid gets on there also too a lot of times the fear of something you get on something like [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5262.44s)]
*  18 or older you have to verify yourself as a kid [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5266.5199999999995s)]
*  I remember you if you even would have clicked something like that and then it opens to another page you get so scared [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5269.32s)]
*  Sometimes you close it down. You know, you'd be like, oh my god, they're gonna know my dad's gonna [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5273.0s)]
*  You know, there was just there was a lot of that kind of fear [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5277.16s)]
*  But now there's just like the ru18 click through button. They didn't even have that [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5279.64s)]
*  Right in 2020 finally now if you're like on a mobile device [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5284.360000000001s)]
*  It'll be like ru18 and then you could just click yes, but some of them now have a thing where you have to have identification [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5287.96s)]
*  Right what state? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5293.16s)]
*  level [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5295.64s)]
*  Government are doing the best help support [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5296.92s)]
*  the the the battle against [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5299.8s)]
*  I guess [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5302.52s)]
*  Porn or dirty porn, you know, or like illegal content illegal content illegal and then porn in general [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5303.72s)]
*  Because at some point it becomes also it can be a moral or ethical I don't know if ethical [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5309.88s)]
*  It could be a moral choice for a population at a certain point. Do we want to continue to consume this? Yeah, I mean [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5314.280000000001s)]
*  from my perspective [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5320.92s)]
*  You know, I think that we could come into agreement about children. Like I think that that could be pretty easy [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5322.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's easily done. I I think that's true. It's just obviously some people don't care [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5327.64s)]
*  So yeah the states that are doing the best to protect kids from access [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5331.64s)]
*  I would probably say I mean the one that's just kind of taking up the fight is texas [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5336.36s)]
*  Like they have they're going they're in the ring, right? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5340.599999999999s)]
*  They're the supreme court trying to battle this out [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5343.16s)]
*  with the big porn [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5345.96s)]
*  Companies and to to implement age verification [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5348.679999999999s)]
*  So I think you know, but there's multiple other states and I would just say like this is bipartisan [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5352.44s)]
*  So there's people from both parties that are in agreement that kids should not be accessing online porn. That's true [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5356.84s)]
*  Um, and then on the other side of the screen, you know, I mean [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5363.96s)]
*  We've had several bills that have been introduced in the united states since 2020 that would require age and consent verification [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5367.96s)]
*  But they didn't pass there's efforts in the uk there's efforts in canada because this isn't just a us issue, right? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5376.52s)]
*  But why aren't they passing more than a dozen states have passed new laws that led to restrictions on pornography [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5383.080000000001s)]
*  Now the supreme court will weigh in right? Yeah. Yeah, you mentioned that right? This is [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5388.6s)]
*  But what's what we need the other side to like we need our government not just to implement age verification for users [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5392.52s)]
*  But also for those who were in the videos, right and that just but here's but has that bill gone to them before and they didn't [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5399.72s)]
*  Pass it. It just didn't it kind of you know, uh [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5405.64s)]
*  At the end of it was like at the end of a session and then it kind of died and then you have to reintroduce it [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5408.36s)]
*  But here's the thing we don't really [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5412.92s)]
*  have to [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5416.2s)]
*  Enact that law in order to rein in these big porn companies because we have laws that govern [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5417.72s)]
*  Studio produce porn like the brick and mortar [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5424.68s)]
*  porn valley [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5427.88s)]
*  You know pornography has always been highly regulated and they've abided by those regulations [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5429.240000000001s)]
*  Like one of them is called usc 2257 and that's been in place since 1988. It's a law. It's a law in the u.s [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5435.0s)]
*  It's a crime [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5441.8s)]
*  To distribute or to produce porn if you don't verify the age and consent of those who are in the videos [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5443.32s)]
*  and that has been in place for [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5450.92s)]
*  Decades and it has been complied with the only problem is in the internet age [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5453.299999999999s)]
*  When it became user generated content, then these sites say well [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5458.04s)]
*  We get a pass because guess what? We're not the ones that are producing the power. We're hosting it [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5462.2s)]
*  We're just hosting it. We're just but in the case of pornhub. They've tried to make that argument [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5466.84s)]
*  It doesn't really hold because not only is it about producing it's also about distributing [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5471.8s)]
*  It's transferring and they had that download button on every video where from their servers [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5477.72s)]
*  They were transferring this content to the devices of millions of people around and that's illegal [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5483.56s)]
*  I mean, isn't it true if somebody if they find child pornography on someone that they can oh just to possess it [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5489.0s)]
*  I mean victims couldn't even possess their own videos of abuse [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5494.92s)]
*  Like I had to be meticulously careful, but then these sites can like can transfer so much possessing it on their servers is actually [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5499.32s)]
*  It's actually legal and they we now in these seven 11 to the law litigation [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5507.4s)]
*  There's employees who are going back and forth in their messages going [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5511.16s)]
*  I just had to download one of the worst child abuse videos that i've ever witnessed [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5514.759999999999s)]
*  I need to see a therapist for what I just witnessed. Uh-oh. I forgot to delete it [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5519.719999999999s)]
*  Am I going to get I could go away for a long time for this? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5524.599999999999s)]
*  Like these are the conversations that are turning up from pornhub employees in [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5527.4s)]
*  Discovery that they are doing this so you're concerned right if they're concerned at that level [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5532.12s)]
*  Yeah [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5537.24s)]
*  So there's laws like we already have laws that can be implemented to like you can't distribute child pornography [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5537.5599999999995s)]
*  Usb 2257 it just they have to be modernized and applied [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5544.5s)]
*  Today over the modern way that we distribute porn on the internet [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5549.0s)]
*  It's funny sometimes it seems like our government is kind of the lat like [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5553.88s)]
*  Once something has come through and made all of its money and ruined so many lives, then they'll help with it [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5556.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's why i'm always like how complicit is our own government sometimes in a lot of these things because that's what it feels like [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5561.64s)]
*  It's like oh after this wave of [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5567.96s)]
*  Has ruined the lives of a million people and made half a billion dollars, then we'll shut it down [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5570.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like that's why I'm like everybody's had their grift or their hand in it [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5575.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's why i'm really hopeful about the route of [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5579.4800000000005s)]
*  You know strategic civil litigation empowering survivors in that way to hold the financial institutions accountable, right? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5583.24s)]
*  Because I think that could go way faster [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5589.16s)]
*  Which credit companies are still accepting payments for pornography websites? Oh pornography websites. Um, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5591.400000000001s)]
*  Well all of them except american express. Okay, so american express is the only they've never been involved in online or like pornography [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5598.2s)]
*  So american express is the only [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5606.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah credit card [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5609.0s)]
*  company [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5610.6s)]
*  That doesn't [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5612.28s)]
*  Will not allow its information to be used on pornography websites. Yeah, okay [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5613.88s)]
*  Yeah, and i'm not suggesting that that has to be the position of like the other credit card companies [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5618.44s)]
*  No, but if they're not going to say that we're not going to verify things. Yeah [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5624.44s)]
*  that well the [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5628.28s)]
*  That's the easy route here is for them to just say [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5630.28s)]
*  Like we have anti-money laundering policy. We have this [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5634.2s)]
*  Anti-exploitation policy policy and you have to verify age and consent if you want to do business visa [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5636.599999999999s)]
*  That's it like and that will that that'll take place instantly and globally like it'll apply everywhere [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5643.0s)]
*  So what could we say then to the companies like if we were to put out a clip? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5649.88s)]
*  It's like hey, this is what? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5652.44s)]
*  right now credit card companies are allowing [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5654.2s)]
*  Transactions on pornography that are not verifying the age and consent that are not verifying the age and consent [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5658.42s)]
*  Of every individual in every single video every individual in every single video [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5665.959999999999s)]
*  And they need to stop that and they need to stop that right now [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5670.28s)]
*  The only one who doesn't do it is american express, right? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5672.759999999999s)]
*  Because they just have like this blanket policy against because they have a blanket policy [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5675.639999999999s)]
*  but the other ones, um [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5679.639999999999s)]
*  So you could so hypothetically someone could be watching a pornography video on a website [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5682.679999999999s)]
*  that the user is [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5688.679999999999s)]
*  Uh being coerced or trafficked under the influence [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5691.639999999999s)]
*  child minor or a child or a minor [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5695.48s)]
*  and [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5699.24s)]
*  The websites are not verifying that that isn't the case. There's no verification at the point of upload [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5701.24s)]
*  So like what they try to say is okay, let anybody upload right and then [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5706.759999999999s)]
*  Later on, you know if somebody complains we'll try to take it down quickly and sometimes, you know [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5712.599999999999s)]
*  They didn't used to even take it down quickly, right? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5717.32s)]
*  Or our moderators review it but no before so this is like prevention [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5719.799999999999s)]
*  Because there's that immortalization of trauma, right? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5724.86s)]
*  One hour is too long on a site. That's getting 170 million views per day [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5727.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know and even if they can't download you can screen record like you can right so like [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5733.34s)]
*  Any minute is too long. We have to stop it before it gets uploaded and the only way to do that [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5738.94s)]
*  Is to age and consent verify before it's uploaded and they because of the technology that we have like they can do that at scale [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5744.86s)]
*  Like they can do that on a right they could do it but they don't because but they don't because money because [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5751.82s)]
*  Friction because when you introduce friction to uploading you get less uploading right? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5758.0599999999995s)]
*  You get less people who will do it and so that goes against the whole big porn free porn [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5762.94s)]
*  Business model because they need massive amounts of content, right? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5768.94s)]
*  So anything that you would do that would diminish the amount of content on these sites [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5772.38s)]
*  They don't want to do got it [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5777.34s)]
*  They have to be forced to do it and actually as of september of 2024 porn hub after being criminally charged, right? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5778.620000000001s)]
*  And have have this monitor over their site [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5784.860000000001s)]
*  They're finally saying that we're going to start verifying the age and consent of those who are in the videos as of september of [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5787.26s)]
*  2024 [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5794.76s)]
*  However, they still have millions of videos that were uploaded prior that time that we don't know that they don't know [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5796.22s)]
*  Yeah, and visa and mastercard and are those companies are still accepting payments on those site? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5802.7s)]
*  Well, no not on porn hub or not on porno not on pornhub or any of the mind geek iLo owned tube sites [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5807.42s)]
*  Okay, they will not so they're on those they're not they're done [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5813.66s)]
*  Yeah, and that's for the consent of the people in the videos, too [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5816.38s)]
*  Yes, so they they need to verify age and consent of those [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5820.22s)]
*  But what i'm saying is is is pornhub currently accepting visa and mastercard payments at all? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5824.38s)]
*  No, okay, they can't they would they would like to but they can't they can't no they've been cut off from that [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5829.26s)]
*  But pornhub is still not as of september 2024 [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5836.139999999999s)]
*  They said they were going to start verifying the age of consent of those of individuals from then on but not prior [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5839.82s)]
*  We don't know yet [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5846.139999999999s)]
*  No, for sure. They're not for sure. They haven't deleted [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5847.58s)]
*  The content that was uploaded prior to that where it's only the uploader that was verified, right? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5851.179999999999s)]
*  And it's not just like rocky che franklin. I mean there's [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5856.7s)]
*  Multiple other victims who are currently suing pornhub because they had verified uploaders uploading their trafficking their rape and abuse [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5859.42s)]
*  Got it. So that's you know, so that's the lay of the land. That's the solution [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5867.26s)]
*  Going forward and it's a matter of like public pressure. So I believe like this conversation is so [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5871.34s)]
*  valuable to this fight because we're introducing [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5878.46s)]
*  Not only the problem to so many people who probably never heard that this was an issue before [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5882.32s)]
*  But also the solution so that we can pressure those in positions of power to implement the solutions to make the internet a safer place [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5887.04s)]
*  Right. So who do we pressure though? Like who do I when if I have I have them in here? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5894.56s)]
*  Yeah, who do I ask and what do I ask them? Okay [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5898.64s)]
*  So if you have like the ceo visa or mastercard or the vps there [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5902.16s)]
*  That's why do you not have this policy in place and what will it take to get you there? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5907.92s)]
*  um [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5913.36s)]
*  because the policy of age and consent verification for every single person in every single video on a user generated porn site [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5914.08s)]
*  Like that it's not going to stop at 100 percent, but it's going to stop it a lot. Yeah, it's going to really [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5922.08s)]
*  You know just help make like I said like the internet an actual safer place [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5928.8s)]
*  Oh, I wish that 15 years ago I would open it up and like a fuck I can't even get in this thing [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5933.44s)]
*  I can't even do it. Fuck it. I'm gonna go outside. I'm gonna go take a walk or i'm gonna go do something [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5937.28s)]
*  I'm gonna respond to one of my buddy's text messages. I was asking me to go do something [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5941.36s)]
*  I'm gonna go do something positive more positive for myself. I did a lot of positive things. I'm not saying [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5944.5599999999995s)]
*  like woe is me or anything like that, but when it came to a lot of like, uh [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5949.759999999999s)]
*  relationships and intimacy type shit I was more like [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5955.5s)]
*  it was [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5958.4s)]
*  it was just uncomfortable and so [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5959.679999999999s)]
*  Using pornography was easier, but then that started to kind of like [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5961.92s)]
*  fray like the part of me I think that even cared about building a relationship because it [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5967.4400000000005s)]
*  I didn't nurture that part of me at all part of some of the times it didn't it didn't even grow [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5972.72s)]
*  How would it grow if i'm not sitting there? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5976.4800000000005s)]
*  you know [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5978.8s)]
*  Nurturing it or paying attention to it. Yeah, you know the only part of just that dopamine freaking [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5980.08s)]
*  You know my dopamine thing was just leaking or whatever, you know, because i'm just sitting there [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5984.72s)]
*  Just watching all this slurplord stuff on there. It's just try it. It's just but anyway, whatever dude god [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5988.8s)]
*  Well, one of the things that's also happening is not just like intimacy and relational issues. Yeah, because that happens, right? Oh, yeah, dude, but [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=5994.8s)]
*  it's also um [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6003.2s)]
*  Men young men are having kind of an epidemic of what they call porn induced erectile dysfunction. Oh, yeah [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6005.76s)]
*  And yeah p i e d where so there was a study in canada [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6012.96s)]
*  And it was in the journal of sexual medicine and they had found a third of young men between 16 and 21 [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6017.84s)]
*  had [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6025.92s)]
*  Issues with porn induced erectile dysfunction. Oh, yeah, buddy, and they're young [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6027.12s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's heartbreaking and then here's that creates a ton of shame and a lot of that's just nervous energy [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6032.24s)]
*  And then here's the thing if you get used to watching porn [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6036.96s)]
*  Then you finally are in an instance with a woman or the is this some sexual activity or whatever? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6040.0s)]
*  It's so foreign to whatever the part of your brain that watches a screen and the part of your brain that engages with someone are two [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6045.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know this for a fact, but to me it feels like two totally different parts [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6052.88s)]
*  one of them is very active and feels very visceral and real and one of them feels very passive and uh [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6057.6s)]
*  Um [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6068.0s)]
*  Transactional almost [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6069.34s)]
*  In a way [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6071.04s)]
*  Like i'm going to give this my attention and i'm going to get some reward out of it, but that's all this is [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6072.08s)]
*  Whereas over here. This is a field of communication and connection, right? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6078.0s)]
*  so [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6083.04s)]
*  um [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6083.92s)]
*  So yeah, I wanted to watch this right here watching pornography [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6084.96s)]
*  This is uh from neuroscience news watching pornography rewires the brain to a more juvenile state. That's interesting [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6088.24s)]
*  Um pornography has existed throughout recorded history [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6095.04s)]
*  I'd love to get someone to come in and talk about just the whole history of it [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6098.32s)]
*  Um hundreds of at the bottom here. We have the impact [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6103.28s)]
*  Okay in the long term pornography seems to create sexual dysfunctions [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6106.72s)]
*  Especially the inability to achieve erection or orgasm with a real life partner [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6110.5599999999995s)]
*  Marital quality and commitment to one's romantic partner also appear to be compromised to try to explain these effects some [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6114.32s)]
*  Scientists have drawn parallels between porn consumption and substance abuse [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6121.1s)]
*  Through evolutionary design the brain is wired to respond to sexual stimulation with surges of dopamine [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6126.88s)]
*  So if you get sexually simulated your brain gives dopamine and that makes sense because [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6133.12s)]
*  We're creatures that are supposed to reproduce right and have attraction [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6138.56s)]
*  This neurotransmitter most often associated with reward anticipation also acts to program memories and information into the brain [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6143.4400000000005s)]
*  This [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6151.04s)]
*  Adaption means that when the body requires something like food or sex the brain remembers where to return to experience the same pleasure [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6151.98s)]
*  Instead of turning to a romantic partner for sexual gratification or fulfillment [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6158.16s)]
*  Habituated porn users instinctively reach for their phones and laptops when desire comes calling [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6162.299999999999s)]
*  Furthermore, unnaturally strong explosions of reward and pleasure evoke unnaturally strong degrees of habituation in the brain. Dang [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6167.679999999999s)]
*  That's wild. I could definitely see that [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6175.28s)]
*  What's the point of having sex with a parent? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6177.36s)]
*  Yeah, and then it's like and then you feel ashamed, you know [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6180.16s)]
*  Like what parent wants to go and talk to their son and wish him good night if he's been master [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6184.4s)]
*  I'm sure that's a weird thing. You know i'm saying like I don't know what that's like, but i'm sure that there's some shame there [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6188.96s)]
*  It's like well, that's where I think that [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6193.759999999999s)]
*  One of the the important things that we can do is create like actually shame-free zones where kids [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6196.16s)]
*  Like the kitchen or whatever. I don't know. I mean like your household, right? Like [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6203.12s)]
*  Where you can feel like you're in a relationship that is safe to talk about the things that you would feel ashamed [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6207.28s)]
*  Talking about yeah, you know because then you don't just stuff it down. Well, that's what recovery meetings [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6215.28s)]
*  That's one thing that's why I think 12 step meetings are great because it's like and if people are wondering [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6219.599999999999s)]
*  Well, how do I get another meeting? There's slaa.org. I think it's called if you want to look at that up, Nick and see [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6223.5199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6230.16s)]
*  But yeah, but you can also look up slaa online and that's just you can find meetings and then once you get into a meeting [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6231.599999999999s)]
*  You could talk to people now. You're not a weirdo now. You get in a program [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6237.28s)]
*  You kind of get some things organized you create a basically a set of principles for yourself [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6239.84s)]
*  And then you have a new kind of design of for living [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6244.08s)]
*  I wonder too though like in all of this in the recovery and all the ways that you can help [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6247.12s)]
*  Yourself and people who are struggling with this [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6253.12s)]
*  You know does hearing [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6256.96s)]
*  This truth about the victims who are on the other side of the screen. I've had [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6258.8s)]
*  Numerous people and men and women who have struggled with compulsive [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6263.5199999999995s)]
*  Porn addiction that they didn't want but they couldn't like kick it [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6270.32s)]
*  They just really struggled with it. And when they heard about the victims who? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6274.08s)]
*  Could be behind that screen on these sites, right? Which is the primary way that porn is distributed today [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6280.16s)]
*  they felt like it finally gave them the [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6286.48s)]
*  The [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6289.5199999999995s)]
*  like fortitude or the motivation to just be like I don't want to [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6290.719999999999s)]
*  Participate in somebody else's trauma. Like I don't want to participate in their suffering. I don't want to give money [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6296.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't want to give clicks and views [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6301.28s)]
*  to a big porn corporation who's making a living off of the devastation of real victims lives and that is actually what [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6303.759999999999s)]
*  gave them the [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6313.2s)]
*  I guess like the ammunition to just finally like be like no like i'm not gonna [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6315.2s)]
*  I'm not gonna do that. Yeah, what were some well, I certainly think you're right though [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6320.88s)]
*  It's like I have some friends at work in porn and that sort of thing and it's not like [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6324.16s)]
*  I don't think what they're doing is bad. I don't think that for me porn isn't good, right? [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6327.84s)]
*  It's not a good it's not it hasn't been a tool that I used properly or whatever [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6332.72s)]
*  And I don't think it's good for me, right? It may be good for some people might be good for them [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6337.2s)]
*  Um, but i'm not damning the people that work in it or anything like that. No, I neither am I I mean I [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6342.88s)]
*  Like to each his own for sure, but the kids should be able to access it [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6348.96s)]
*  I think I don't think it's good. No kids is where you draw the line [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6352.8s)]
*  because they can't choose like they need to be able to [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6356.32s)]
*  Get to adulthood before they decide where they can make that decision and also it's that prefrontal [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6360.88s)]
*  Cortex of the brain where it's like that decision-making center of the brain. It's not even developed [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6366.5599999999995s)]
*  So they can't like oh reason like should is this going to be good for me? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6371.6s)]
*  Or do I want to do this or what are the consequences of me? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6375.84s)]
*  You know, and they just don't have that yet. And so like they definitely need to be protected [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6379.6s)]
*  But once you're an adult, you know, you can make decisions like you should have the freedom to make whatever decisions you want [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6383.68s)]
*  And I I take the position of like what you know, if it's it's consenting adult like that's their business, right? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6389.92s)]
*  Yep, I agree [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6396.08s)]
*  But then also be we also have this like imagine if you opened your door and there was just a bunch of porn there [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6396.88s)]
*  That's really what it's like. It's like, you know, I mean the internet's just our front porch now [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6401.6s)]
*  it's like so you open your door and everything is there everything is there so if you as a parent or as a [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6406.08s)]
*  Country kind of can't decide maybe what should and shouldn't be there sort of and at a certain point you see enough proof [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6412.0s)]
*  well [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6418.72s)]
*  90 percent of this many this much percentage of people maybe get addicted to this it ruins this many marriages [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6419.92s)]
*  Hypothetic like at a certain point you might think this isn't for our society [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6425.2s)]
*  This just doesn't help society that much overall. I'm not saying that I don't know if that's true [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6429.5199999999995s)]
*  but [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6435.04s)]
*  At least we can all I mean everybody can agree that like step one [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6435.92s)]
*  Let's just keep kids away from accessing it and then you know [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6440.96s)]
*  Because they will get it they will get that compulsive porn use when they oh, yeah, no doubt about that. I think we get it [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6444.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think that's yeah, I think there's no doubt about it [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6450.639999999999s)]
*  It would be hard to hear listen to anyone's argument against that [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6454.0s)]
*  Well, it's I mean they're not arguing that kids shouldn't watch porn [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6457.6s)]
*  But they're arguing against the ways that we can prevent them from doing it, which is kind of the same thing, isn't it? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6462.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's just a different. Yeah, I guess it's a different way to say it [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6467.2s)]
*  But yeah, and who were the people that are arguing against the point the big the people who profit from it, right? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6470.400000000001s)]

*  Sitting in front of you, um, you know, I think probably you could just ask them look we need to introduce [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6482.8s)]
*  Preventative laws to help keep victims from being abused on on these sites across the internet [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6489.74s)]
*  And that is again agent consent verification for every individual and I don't think there would be resistance to that [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6495.28s)]
*  Like I don't even think that the the porn industry itself has a real legitimate [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6500.96s)]
*  Uh, you know way to resist that or they would because they have been complying with usc [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6506.16s)]

*  They've been doing it so the internet just hasn't yeah [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6517.84s)]

*  Yeah, so they just need to get up get up at the times [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6523.52s)]
*  It's the gap in between when the government is behind the times and when when people get hurt, right? Oh, yeah [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6526.4800000000005s)]

*  I was just like I watched pornography instead of hook up with my girlfriend or have some sort of intimacy with my girlfriend [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6583.52s)]
*  And I man I feel horrible about that years later, you know [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6588.320000000001s)]
*  I just didn't have uh [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6592.24s)]
*  I didn't know how to do it. You know, I just was kind of [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6595.919999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I think I was I didn't I was I didn't want to talk to her about stuff [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6600.0s)]
*  and so I just it was easier to do that, yeah than uh, like engage with her and [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6603.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you know, but it's just it you know, just all comes at a cost at the time. I didn't think that it was [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6609.28s)]
*  You know, I don't know what I thought. I don't think I was thinking I think just I was like [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6615.36s)]
*  Oh, this is the easy way and I wasn't kind of brave enough to take the tougher work the tougher route of like [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6618.72s)]
*  let's [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6624.0s)]
*  Lay here and talk and see what's going on and then maybe build up some intimacy [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6625.4400000000005s)]
*  But even to just recognize that is like so [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6628.88s)]
*  Awesome. I was outsourcing a lot of my intimacy, you know, just to this screen that didn't care about me [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6632.08s)]
*  Really? Yeah, and then to potentially the people on the other side of the screen you're saying they don't even know [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6636.8s)]
*  You know, it's like it's a really pretty twisted sir. If you know [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6640.320000000001s)]
*  Both sides if you say if like there's somebody who's masturbating to a video of something that they [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6644.400000000001s)]
*  The person didn't want to be in it, right? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6649.280000000001s)]
*  They're being exploited this person is doing it just because out of addiction or shame, you know or addiction [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6650.88s)]
*  They're stuck in this cycle that this is how they do to make themselves feel. Okay, then you basically have this [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6656.160000000001s)]
*  Exploitation people cycle. Yeah, neither one wants to be doing anything that they're doing and it's just this magnet [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6660.9400000000005s)]
*  Lack of freedom here and lack of freedom here [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6666.4800000000005s)]
*  Because they're doing what they don't want to do and they're being forced to do, you know [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6669.5199999999995s)]
*  They're being exploited here. Their freedom is being taken away [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6672.72s)]
*  It's like we need freedom freedom on both sides, right? Yeah, it's in a right. I mean being alive is a it's in it's a journey [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6675.84s)]
*  um [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6683.68s)]

*  Thank you. Yeah [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6689.12s)]
*  And also just to not also if you like pornography and you can use it in a [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6690.0s)]
*  Way, that's okay for you. Then that's your world too [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6694.16s)]
*  I don't want everything to be a debbie downer that everything is horrible and this and that [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6696.4s)]
*  Um, we're not looking at that [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6700.48s)]
*  You know if you can casually jerk off or whatever touch your body or whatever and that's good for you, you know [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6702.4s)]
*  but I think this is when it maybe gets out of control and then [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6708.799999999999s)]
*  At certain ages people look at pornography differently too. I think you know, I think when you're 17 or something [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6713.2s)]
*  You're like just you know [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7187j4PO4&t=6718.32s)]
