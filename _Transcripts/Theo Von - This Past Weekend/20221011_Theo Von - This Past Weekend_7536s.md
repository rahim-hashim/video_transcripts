*  You know and I'm curious as to what his life has been like and what life is like [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=40.0s)]
*  Going through it as him [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=46.24s)]
*  Today's guest is mr. Scott [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=48.28s)]
*  And tell you [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=58.0s)]
*  So what is typically the the premise of this show [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=78.88s)]
*  And that's a great question actually um the premise cuz I just see highlight clips I follow you and stuff [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=82.1s)]
*  Yes, I just see the funny highlights and sometimes you're deep as hell [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=87.82s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes some great great words of wisdom. I don't know what the that's a great question [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=92.34s)]
*  I'm wonder if we ever had a I think the premise is like [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=98.38s)]
*  Mmm, just real conversation. Yeah, I think I'm always just trying to like I'm kind of like a late bloomer [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=103.22s)]
*  I'm kind of like a late bloomer. I feel like when it comes to like [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=108.66s)]
*  evolving as a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=112.3s)]
*  Probably as a man and as a human being [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  So I think somehow that ends up being a lot of the premise. Yeah, I knew it up here [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  But I didn't put it into action you knew what what was going on come out in my words in my songs [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  But I'm living it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's so hard. It's hard to get I guess in the action, huh? Mm-hmm [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=128.78s)]
*  I mean you guys [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=136.42s)]
*  Scottstapp sitting here [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  Your band how big was Creed how big was your band? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=140.26000000000002s)]
*  I tell you um [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  during our peak [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=146.78s)]
*  we were doing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=148.46s)]
*  back-to-back nights at arenas and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=150.3s)]
*  Had just started putting stadiums on hold [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=153.22s)]
*  When we went our separate ways the first time [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=157.22s)]
*  When you guys separated? Yes. Wow. Yes. So you guys had all that kind of work like potentially on the books [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=161.46s)]
*  Yeah, we sure did we sure did and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=167.74s)]
*  What what was what kind of calls like what causes a band at that? Is it just were you guys exhausted? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=171.38s)]
*  Was it just differences of opinion? What kind of causes a because it would seem like everything's kind of you know, it's it's so complicated [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=184.78s)]
*  for me [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=187.18s)]
*  It was exhaustion from the run to get there [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=188.78s)]
*  I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=192.3s)]
*  Mixed with just some poor decisions in order to keep the machine going [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  Thinking I was taking one for the team didn't and not understanding and knowing the consequences of those actions [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=197.94000000000003s)]
*  And then just you know people grow apart and and everyone's dreams [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=204.74s)]
*  May not be fulfilled at that moment in time [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=210.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know, but we got back together in 2009 and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  Made a new record and it did did really well and had a good run till 2012 and and then [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=219.84s)]
*  We're on hiatus again [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  Was that second run was it different than the the first experience? Was it like most definitely? Yeah, most definitely [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  The first experience was you know, we were family. We were brothers [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=235.8s)]
*  We were in college together. We we did holidays together. Wow, we were all we had [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=246.84s)]
*  Second experience, you know, everyone's successful wealthy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=248.28s)]
*  and you know [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  Egos have grown. Yeah, and and people change and people people grow [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=254.8s)]
*  and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=261.4s)]
*  people grow apart [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=262.52s)]
*  Success is scared. It's kind of scary. I feel like did you find that success became like for me success became real scary [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=264.96s)]
*  I felt like if I got to a certain part of success and I didn't know that I felt this but I thought like a lot [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=272.16s)]
*  of things in my life would [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=278.16s)]
*  Like problems I had and issues that I had going on that they would just kind of go away, right and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  And I there was a part of me that was shocked that that wasn't the case when I found some success it almost [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=286.44s)]
*  I mean it really hit me hard that that wasn't the case. Yeah, it definitely wasn't the case for me it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=293.16s)]
*  created new problems and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=299.44000000000005s)]
*  Metastasized old ones. Yeah, and then the pressure of maintaining that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  You know for me the the pressure of knowing that you know every show [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  Rested on my ability to go out on stage and sing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=313.8s)]
*  Of course, we were a band and and and everyone, you know had to be present to be there, but I felt such a pressure [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=317.56s)]
*  and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=324.48s)]
*  You know that that weighed on me and not having a support system in place [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=325.92s)]
*  You know to help me [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=333.36s)]
*  Took its toll and and I didn't make all the right decisions [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=335.56s)]
*  But hey who does when they're 24 and 25, I don't beat myself up over it anymore. Yeah. No [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=338.88s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like that's a tough thing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=345.56s)]
*  Because I found that I would beat I would you're so hard on yourself to get and that's what got you to where you were [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=348.04s)]
*  Right probably right. I'm guessing it worked as a fuel. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I had a lot to prove. Yeah [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I left home at 17 [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=361.76s)]
*  Um and came from not a very good situation [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=364.52s)]
*  Where was that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=368.8s)]
*  Just how I was raised and in what uh, what area I mean, sorry, it's a popca, Florida. Mm-hmm [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=370.32s)]
*  Just outside Orlando a lot of missing people in Florida. Yeah, there's a lot of missing people in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=375.96s)]
*  You can go to somebody in Florida be like I became a Florida man headline [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely over time and I mean, I think I fit the mold there every once in a while. Yeah [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=387.28s)]
*  But you know you live and learn man, and I grew up and made all my mistakes [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=393.76s)]
*  That most people I think would make in high school with their buddies. I [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  Made them in the public eye. Mm-hmm [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, I didn't drink or anything in high school didn't go to parties and why was that was very strict religious [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=406.28s)]
*  Household and so I didn't get a chance to make some of those dumb mistakes [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=414.24s)]
*  And so you know what? I made them in public [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=419.76s)]
*  You know [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=424.36s)]
*  And you know what they weren't just little ones they were big [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=426.68s)]
*  You know what I mean, but hey, I look at that now and and and I and I say, you know, I wouldn't be [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=430.32s)]
*  Who I am today [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=437.68s)]
*  The father I am [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=440.8s)]
*  The human being that I that I feel I'm becoming if I didn't make those mistakes [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=442.92s)]
*  Yeah, so I look at them as as a process, you know [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=446.84s)]
*  I'm on a journey in life and there's no guidebook. There's no manual [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=451.32s)]
*  Certainly on how to do this. So I was just flying by the seat of my pants back then man [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=455.88s)]
*  Just just just doing it. My heart was in the right place [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=460.32s)]
*  But my actions sometimes didn't always line up with my heart. You know what I mean? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=463.96s)]
*  Yeah, my heart's in the right place the rest of these somewhere else. Yeah. Yeah, exactly [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=467.84s)]
*  What uh, what do you think kind of shit? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=472.4s)]
*  So coming out of that environment you came out of like a religious environment [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=474.2s)]
*  Was it like like it was one of your parents a pastor or something like how deep into the church [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=477.44s)]
*  Were you personally it was it was very very deep [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  You know church was our our life. It was [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=486.64s)]
*  Wednesday night Friday night youth group twice on Sundays [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=490.12s)]
*  You know and I had an abusive upbringing [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=495.96s)]
*  You know those that that have followed me over the years know about it [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=500.08s)]
*  And I think the worst part of it was being abused in the name of God mmm [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=503.86s)]
*  but like what is like like [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=509.1s)]
*  So like somebody reprimanding you beating beating. Oh, wow ritually Wow, you know, I [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=511.82s)]
*  Remember getting beat every Monday night [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=518.82s)]
*  For everything that I didn't get caught doing or that I thought that no one [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=521.42s)]
*  saw or that went on in my mind [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=527.78s)]
*  And then you know relatively quickly about an hour afterwards after the beating [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=531.22s)]
*  Hey, you want to come watch some football [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=537.62s)]

*  When like it's okay to be close to somebody how you how you can go from abuse to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=549.5400000000001s)]
*  Immediately like everything being okay. That's all that stuff is so jarring. It was very looking back [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  It was very it was very traumatizing [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=559.14s)]
*  It was it was you know, one thing good out of it is I was made to write the Bible for punishment [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=562.58s)]
*  Hmm, and I would write the Bible and then have to write commentaries on what each chapter meant to me [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=568.74s)]
*  and so [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=574.86s)]
*  Looking back that trained me to be a writer a lyricist [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=576.34s)]
*  It trained me to learn how to put my thoughts on paper in a in a poetic and unique way and and [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=580.62s)]
*  All that knowledge [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=588.38s)]
*  Although I didn't live it [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=591.22s)]
*  For a long period in my life and and still don't always [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=593.26s)]
*  It came out in my lyrics [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=597.1800000000001s)]
*  which went on to [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=599.58s)]
*  Really connect with people. Yeah [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=602.1s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm I look at it again [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=604.22s)]
*  It is what it is and and and I wouldn't change a thing because it it it's all a part [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  Of the building blocks whether it was good or bad [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=613.7800000000001s)]
*  That created the life that that I've lived so far [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=617.26s)]
*  Was there something that kind of helped you get to some of that conclusion because I still have [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=621.34s)]
*  Like I'm sure you probably had resentments against your parents. Oh, absolutely and I find like, you know, I still I have [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=626.26s)]
*  Resentment, you know and it's not it's so it's like so deep sometimes [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=633.26s)]
*  It's like I can let go of it like up here. Yeah, like but man, sometimes there's like something inside of me [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=636.7800000000001s)]
*  It's so locked. It's like yeah, it's hard [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=643.58s)]
*  Yes time, you know time does help [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=646.22s)]
*  But not in every situation and and you know one day for me [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=649.34s)]
*  With each situation that I had held on to resentment for I just woke up one day and felt it lift [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=654.5400000000001s)]
*  And and it was just time and I think maturity and growth [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=661.3000000000001s)]
*  And and then just realizing I just didn't want to worry about him. I didn't want to think about it anymore [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  I wanted to let it go [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  So I guess you call that forgiveness [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=672.46s)]
*  But I'll never forget and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=674.98s)]
*  I'll never forget [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=677.82s)]
*  Because I don't want to do that to my children or anyone that I come in contact with or be that kind of friend to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=679.02s)]
*  The people that I care about. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? Yeah, but resentments are hard man [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=685.74s)]
*  It's hard, bro. Yeah, man, and we can hold on to them forever and and sometimes we can think that we've let it go [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=690.38s)]
*  And we haven't [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=696.62s)]
*  And and they'll rear their head again [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=699.22s)]
*  But again, I think everyone goes through that I think it's part of things is part of being human yeah, you know [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=701.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a sap sometimes resentment. It's like [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=708.1s)]
*  You know, it's uh, you know sap is just so [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=711.94s)]
*  Sticky. Yeah, so fucking sticky man. You really think yeah, you can't clean it all you don't even know where it all is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=716.02s)]
*  Sometimes you never get it off. Yeah. Yeah, I mean you can get it off, but it's just like gosh man [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=722.94s)]

*  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about, you know, and I and I think with with resentment and in your sap analogy [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=732.02s)]
*  You know, I think we can always if if we focus on [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=741.6600000000001s)]
*  Things that have hurt us in our life are ways that we've been betrayed abused mistreated [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=745.3000000000001s)]
*  Mishandled taken advantage of lied to stolen from all the things that can happen [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=751.7800000000001s)]
*  To us in life [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=757.34s)]
*  You know [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=759.94s)]
*  We can find ourselves getting right back into that emotion even though we may have a period where we think we're free from it [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=762.46s)]
*  So it's all about you know, what kind of what consumes your thoughts controls your life [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=768.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, so it's all about [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=774.26s)]
*  Changing the way we think and and I think for me I had to make a conscious effort [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=776.26s)]
*  To do that. I had to eliminate [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=782.7s)]
*  Things in my life that reminded me of [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=785.46s)]
*  Those situations and those people for a period of time. I had to cut off things that were triggers [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=789.34s)]
*  To try to rewire my brain [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=795.5s)]
*  To not go there [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=798.3000000000001s)]
*  You know and every once in a while, you know something will flash up and I'll be like man [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=800.22s)]

*  a family and having your own kids and and it's a single most fulfilling thing in life more has it been more than any [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1699.3400000000001s)]
*  Any success I've had in music [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1707.1000000000001s)]
*  You know when my little boy walks in a room [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1710.6200000000001s)]
*  And just lights up and runs to me and says daddy and and I love you so much dad [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1713.7s)]
*  you know when I'm coaching my my 12 year old and and [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1719.46s)]
*  You know, it's it's and we've had many moments where it's dad pitch, you know, and he's up there and and I know where he wants [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1722.86s)]

*  And he you know, he rips a double and knocks in three one three runs and and I turn and look at him and he's like [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1731.94s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, dude. Those are moments. You can't you can't replace her or you just there's nothing like it. Yeah [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1738.3799999999999s)]
*  At least for me and you never had it growing up. No [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1745.62s)]
*  Yeah, so I can imagine it almost must have double the effect because you're getting to have I would imagine [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1749.08s)]
*  I'm I'm getting to be the father. I wish I had right in your own was getting to live vicariously [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1757.32s)]

*  most definitely [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1772.0s)]
*  But just the unconditional love [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1773.6s)]
*  Is is just so beautiful [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1776.0s)]
*  And we can learn so much as human beings from the unconditional love that children [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1778.8s)]
*  Yeah, give us until they're teenagers. Yeah [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  Then there's conditional [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1790.08s)]
*  But hey dad, we're gonna start conditional love this year, right exactly [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1792.8s)]
*  It's an adjustment as a parent. You kind of get your heart broken. Oh, I'm sure I bet [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1797.08s)]
*  But I bet but anyway, it's it's been the greatest [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1801.56s)]
*  Achievement of my life. I mean because I tell you what nobody who knows me would have ever thought [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1806.32s)]
*  That I'd be here today talking to you [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1814.96s)]
*  Alive with the life that I've led and the family that I have not a single person [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1818.12s)]
*  And so I'm a blessed man. You were deep out there, huh? Yeah, man [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1823.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and and it was a product and no excuses, but it was a product of abuse [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1827.9199999999998s)]
*  It was a product of of of physical abuse [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1833.72s)]
*  Spiritual abuse emotional abuse [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1840.2s)]
*  You know because what happens that kind of manifest I mean I know what happens for me [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1844.2800000000002s)]
*  you know, but for you like does it like manifest itself or like [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1848.16s)]
*  Was it creating like things inside of you that you didn't know like how did it kind of how did that stuff? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1852.64s)]
*  Hinder you, you know, oh it hindered me tremendously growing up. I was very angry [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1859.96s)]
*  You know and again like we were talking about ego earlier that anger turned to a fuel [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1867.04s)]
*  You know that I was gonna prove him wrong. Oh, yeah, you know what I mean? And so it showed them. Yeah, exactly [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1873.32s)]
*  I know exactly and as things go right in your life the things that start to go good that you choose to do it only [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1877.94s)]
*  Just few it's like right. I'm fucking right but eventually that backfires [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1884.2s)]
*  Mmm, that can't be your fuel forever right and and sustain [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1888.8s)]
*  Life because you crash and burn [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1893.44s)]
*  And so but it did fuel me to get there. Yeah, and so [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1896.24s)]
*  But it also now in hindsight [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1901.24s)]
*  Again, like I said earlier [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1904.1599999999999s)]
*  It's completely impacted, you know the way that I am as a father [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1906.24s)]
*  To my kids and what I won't do I've almost gone to the complete [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1911.3999999999999s)]
*  Opposite where my wife has to tell me you can't just be the kids friend. You have to be their parent [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1915.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, so I've got to remind myself [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1921.6s)]
*  To to be you know, I got I got to tell them no [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1925.28s)]
*  Will you probably I would imagine part of you wants to still be there's a big part of you. I [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1929.16s)]
*  Would guess I notice it for myself that still wants to be the child also in a way [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1935.16s)]
*  It may not and I just noticed it for myself [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1940.7s)]
*  Like there's part of me that still wants that never got to be the kid with the you know, like the carefree kid kind of [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1943.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? I got to experience that carefreeness [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1951.18s)]
*  If that's a word [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1955.7s)]
*  During Creed successful run and because of not having that proper upbringing. I didn't know how to handle carefree [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1958.46s)]
*  Carefree meant just life is my candy store. Yeah, I'm gonna do whatever I want [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1966.24s)]
*  And that didn't last too long without biting you [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1972.68s)]
*  Yeah, I guess cuz there's no real top on it [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1975.92s)]
*  You know, like you don't meet like a guy you don't meet a people always say you don't meet a coke head in their 50s [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1978.32s)]
*  You know, I [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1983.08s)]
*  Met a couple. Oh, yeah [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1985.16s)]
*  I met a couple. Yeah, because it just burns you you know, like the drugs and stuff after a while [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1988.48s)]
*  It just burns you out. Oh hundred percent and it doesn't lead to any joy, you know [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1993.88s)]
*  I even notice it with dating it like if I just keep kind of like [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=1998.2800000000002s)]
*  Getting sexual with women that I there's no case, you know that I it's not at a certain point [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2003.24s)]
*  It's not fulfilling something inside of me. Well, it changes changes your entire perception of women [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2008.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you start viewing all women like those women that you were promiscuous with [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2015.5600000000002s)]
*  It's a lack of respect [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2020.52s)]
*  And so you almost have to retrain your brain once you come out of that fog and come out of that dark place [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2022.88s)]
*  on how to view everyone in your life, but you know [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2029.24s)]
*  Specifically women on how to view women. Yeah and realize that not all women are that way [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2032.68s)]
*  Most women aren't that way, right? You know what I mean? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2037.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah, it gets kind of like if you have girls that are like kind of trying to meet up with you after shows and make [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2040.96s)]
*  Out or whatever be sweet [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2046.0s)]
*  Shows and make out or whatever be sexy or whatever then it's like you start you you kind of get tricked into thinking that [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2048.0s)]
*  Anyway a lot of women are just like that that all women are like that and so then you like I think yeah [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2057.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that just becomes your lifestyle [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2062.54s)]
*  And I can only imagine for rock star. It's like and it just seeps into your psyche. Yeah to your being [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2065.24s)]
*  Because that's your reality every day [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2072.52s)]
*  And so when you come out of that it definitely is a process to kind of [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2075.88s)]
*  relearn love yeah relearn [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2082.96s)]
*  how people are in the real world not the fake world of [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2086.2000000000003s)]
*  Rock and roll super stardom. Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine that [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2091.56s)]
*  Did you have like what about like the Christian effected that haven't of that? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2095.52s)]
*  What was that kind of like going into your music and how did that kind of play a role as you [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2099.8s)]
*  because you know like we kind of think of God or of Jesus as like kind of like the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2107.6800000000003s)]
*  he's the ultimate sacrifice or you know, he's really the way and [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2114.0s)]
*  Did did you ever because once you build enough of your own complex you don't even need a God anymore [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2120.32s)]
*  Well, I tell you what one thing I have learned is that God will use you despite yourself [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2126.12s)]
*  Mmm, you know, I feel that when God has a calling on your life [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2131.44s)]
*  There's nothing that you can do. Yeah to get in the way of the plan [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2135.96s)]
*  No matter how hard you try how hard you try to screw up God's plan for your life [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2141.12s)]
*  You can't now you may make it more difficult for yourself and you may have to suffer more [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2146.12s)]
*  But God will use you despite yourself and and you know and and and also, you know, you'll be humbled [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2152.48s)]
*  Yeah, and and that's happened many a times [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2159.28s)]
*  But I've seen over the years that no matter how many times I tried to screw up [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2163.12s)]
*  God's plan for my life [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2169.16s)]
*  You know, I may have went the long way [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2172.84s)]
*  to the end goal [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2175.7599999999998s)]
*  But always got to the end goal in terms of reaching people [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2177.44s)]
*  and and [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2182.84s)]
*  You know keeping that message within the music of hope and pointing people towards something greater than themselves [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2184.36s)]
*  That's a great point man. The music despite whatever issues you were dealing with your music always [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2193.4s)]
*  Gave people a sense of hope and pointing people to God. Yeah [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2200.12s)]
*  And that was a promise that I made God in my little tiny [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2204.28s)]
*  Apartment with a not even an apartment was a bedroom with a mattress [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2208.72s)]
*  Oh [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2213.8s)]
*  I should share dude. I shared a room with this fella and we were just friends, you know [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2214.8s)]
*  And at this lady's place and she made us she had a golden retriever [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2219.88s)]
*  She made us because she had to go to work early. We didn't have jobs [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2224.16s)]
*  She made us put a shirt like on the golden retriever each day. So like wow, it was just [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2227.28s)]
*  I don't know. It was pretty sad. That's that's interesting [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2232.48s)]
*  It was not it was nice cuz I never spent time with someone on the dog [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2236.6s)]
*  But it was also sad to be like just there all day just watching TV. Just like what color was the shirt? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2239.56s)]
*  It was different colors. Oh every day. Yeah, they had like six or seven different ones, you know, but it was uh [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2246.04s)]
*  Where'd she get them? I don't know [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2252.12s)]
*  It was just like a man's t-shirt like a small and we would put it on it. It was kind of a long dog [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2254.48s)]
*  right, right, but uh [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2259.84s)]
*  Yeah, anyway, I don't even know why I told you that but um [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2261.8s)]

*  You know the music still had its message [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2276.4s)]
*  It had its message and and and I had and I've shared this before years ago and and in in my book [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2278.6000000000004s)]
*  That you know, I made a promise to God, you know in my room and I said I promise no matter what [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2285.1200000000003s)]
*  That I will always [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2291.4s)]
*  Put you [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2294.0s)]
*  In my music and in my lyrics in some way that I will always point whether I'm living it or not [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2296.04s)]
*  Because I know the songs will live on no matter what I'm doing now [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2302.08s)]
*  I know that doesn't jive with with a lot of people but but I knew my frailties. I knew my weaknesses [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2305.78s)]
*  I knew I couldn't live the life [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2312.1400000000003s)]
*  That or at the time [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2316.48s)]
*  That [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2318.56s)]
*  You know someone who was who was a Christian artist [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2319.72s)]
*  Was supposed to live so Creed was not a Christian band [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2324.0s)]
*  The guys in fact when when the press started noticing that there was some religious and Christian themes in our music and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2327.12s)]
*  Brought it out. The guys were like in shock. Like what are you writing about man? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2334.8s)]
*  What what is this? Well, this is not what we signed up for [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2339.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? And I get it man. It wasn't part of their rock and roll dream [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2342.64s)]
*  Oh, they were like we don't want to be in a Christian band exactly. Yeah exactly and and to be honest with you [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2346.64s)]
*  I didn't either because at the time that's not the life that that I felt that I could live nor did I want to I [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2351.68s)]
*  Chose a different path [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2358.9199999999996s)]
*  But I honored my promise [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2361.08s)]
*  Did that feel like a lot of prep? Cuz then the media almost made it seem like oh, this is a Christian band, right? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2363.2s)]
*  so then that adds a whole did it add a whole nother level of pressure to seem like a Christian in the or like to [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2368.52s)]
*  We didn't right I mean we talked about it. I mean, you know the guys were not happy [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2374.6s)]
*  Because exactly what you said they didn't want to live with that pressure and that burden [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2380.6s)]
*  That was not something signed up for they signed up to be in a rock and roll band man. They came with it [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2384.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and Christian bands always have like that one. They've always put a cage on that one dude on the stage. That's insane, bro [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? I [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2396.7999999999997s)]
*  Know go to like a like a church like there's always like the band up there, which is cool [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2399.24s)]
*  Are you talking about the drummer? Yes. Okay, they always came the plexiglass. Yeah. Yeah, why do they cage him up? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2403.5s)]
*  I don't know man. That's just I don't I just [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2410.74s)]
*  It makes me feel like he did something bad and they put it in there like I just don't it there [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2413.98s)]
*  I don't know. There's just something about that. I don't know. Hey, you know what? We all do stuff that are bad, man [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2418.94s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2423.14s)]
*  We're all human. Well, then each week they should put it [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2424.14s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. There should be there should be a cage around all of us. Yeah, that's true. That's really true [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2427.1s)]
*  You know, so you guys so so so that added some pressure then but you had to talk with your band members [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2434.18s)]
*  That like so were they upset with you about that? There was a time when they were yeah, absolutely [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2440.62s)]
*  Wow hundred percent and also, you know, they knew that I wasn't living it so they were like, why is it in there? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2446.86s)]
*  That's not you and I'm like because I have to man. It's I know it's right [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2453.58s)]
*  This is what I felt called to do I because when I was little when I was younger [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2459.1s)]
*  I felt called to be a pastor. I preached my first sermon [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2463.46s)]
*  alright in front of probably a [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2468.1s)]
*  Thousand people in a youth group Wow when I was 12 or 13 years old at Calvary Assembly of God in Orlando, Florida [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2470.7s)]
*  mmm, and so that's it's interesting and [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2477.9399999999996s)]
*  So that was always in me [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2482.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I went to the complete polar opposite of what a preacher is [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2486.38s)]
*  But still in my writings could not escape [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2491.94s)]
*  What I knew was right right or what I felt was right and that is to point people [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2496.3s)]
*  To God to point people to something greater to point people to a spiritual life in the spiritual realm [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2502.54s)]
*  Which I knew was real [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2509.1s)]
*  Which I had felt as a child [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2510.7400000000002s)]
*  And I've felt on stage [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2514.02s)]
*  Thousands of times and continue to to this day so I can't deny it because I know it's real I felt it, right [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2516.62s)]
*  Yeah, I've had some spiritual experiences in my own life when [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2522.98s)]
*  I've turned my life over to a higher power right or asked a higher power [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2526.42s)]
*  Ask God to come into my life and help me right, you know that have blown my mind. Yeah, really. It's really crazy when [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2530.1s)]
*  The connection with something [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2538.14s)]
*  Because I didn't trust anybody in the world [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2540.94s)]
*  you know, which is normal of a lot of people in recovery and stuff and and [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2543.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's why they get you with God [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2547.54s)]
*  They kind of like lead you to God or to a higher power of your choice, right? You can pick your own [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2549.94s)]
*  Because only something on world on like earthly [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2556.74s)]
*  Would I be willing to believe in right because it feels like everything in the earth or every human in the earth has let me down [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2561.94s)]
*  That's what part of me feels like whether that's true or not. Yeah. Well, that's what we do as human beings [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2569.3s)]
*  We let each other right whether we mean to or not. I know it's crazy isn't you know what I mean? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2573.6600000000003s)]
*  And and I think that's why in recovery [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2577.98s)]
*  They do point you to a higher power because not only do we let [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2581.2200000000003s)]
*  Other people down on a regular basis. Oh, yeah, we let ourselves down all the time [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2585.34s)]
*  And that's what led us to having to join a recovery group a recovery program because we had let ourselves down so bad [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2590.94s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2598.7799999999997s)]
*  and so the only way to come out of that bottom is to look up and [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2599.9s)]
*  You know, I think we've been kind of programmed to believe that God is up there somewhere in the universe [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2606.14s)]
*  And so that's why we use those [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2612.16s)]
*  Analogies of looking up but I believe God is all around us [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2614.18s)]
*  He's in everything if you look for him or her however you want to describe it. I describe God [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2617.22s)]
*  I see God as a traditional God [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2622.74s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2624.78s)]
*  Not the dogma that I was raised on, you know this punishing hellfire and brimstone [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2625.98s)]
*  You know if you say a curse word and get hit by a car no matter how good you lived your life [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2631.52s)]
*  You're gonna burn in hell. I mean, that's how I grew up [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2636.02s)]
*  I don't believe that [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2638.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't believe that I can love my children [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2640.94s)]
*  More than my God can love me [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2645.42s)]
*  And so the same grace that I can extend my sons and my daughter the same [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2647.94s)]
*  Unconditional love no matter what they do. I'm never gonna stop loving them. Okay, I don't believe that I can love more than God [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2654.14s)]
*  I believe my love is a fraction of how God loves us. And so when I got to that place [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2661.64s)]
*  It really freed me of a lot of guilt and shame [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2667.62s)]
*  and responsibility almost in a weird way of like [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2672.54s)]
*  Unnecessary responsibility right now. I still I still have a tremendous guilty conscience when I make a mistake [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2675.98s)]
*  I will I will torture myself. I will have sleepless nights [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2681.94s)]
*  Even if no one knows but me [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2687.26s)]
*  Yourself up. Yeah, and I just have to go through it and I have to endure it. That's just my nature [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2690.02s)]
*  Why do we do that Scott? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2695.02s)]
*  Cuz a lot of like my [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2696.86s)]
*  listeners over the years and people that like this show they always will they will often comment even when I see some of them in [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2698.4s)]
*  person, hey man, you're too hard on yourself, you know and [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2703.64s)]
*  I don't even know if I notice it, you know, it's like [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2707.86s)]
*  But when I hear you say that, you know, and I know it's common amongst people [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2711.94s)]
*  That have been in recovery and gone through [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2717.26s)]
*  You know certain types of struggle with certain types of addiction or addictive natures [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2720.58s)]
*  Why is that? Why are we so why are we so hard on ourselves? Well, I mean for me now it's emotional relapses [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2725.68s)]
*  And I'm sure you've heard that that expression and that's saying, you know [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2733.1s)]
*  The relapses aren't you know going out and getting a bottle of Jack and an eight ball, you know [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2737.78s)]
*  The the relapses are character flaws character defects. Oh, yeah, and I and I tell you, you know when I have those [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2743.1s)]
*  I'm [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2752.54s)]
*  You know, they destroy me and I'm working on that. I'm working on giving myself as much grace as I extend [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2753.62s)]
*  You know my children. Yeah, because that's my frame of reference is my kids because that's [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2760.46s)]
*  That's the purest form of love that I can understand and comprehend [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2766.5400000000004s)]
*  And so I'm trying to recently [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2772.5800000000004s)]
*  With some things that have gone on in my life is I'm trying to learn to extend the same grace and love [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2776.5400000000004s)]
*  That I do to my children to other people that are in my life [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2782.5800000000004s)]
*  And myself and it's hard. It's difficult. Where do you think that comes from that being so hard on yourself? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2788.86s)]
*  Or do you have any if I'm just what I mean different insight that I might I've had I mean for me [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2796.1800000000003s)]
*  I think I was programmed that way [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2801.0600000000004s)]
*  Because of you know as a child [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2803.1400000000003s)]
*  You know the abuse that I endured in the name of God [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2806.3s)]
*  And would they whip me and talk about God? Yeah [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2810.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, strip me naked and oh beat me from the back of my neck to the bottom of my feet [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2813.3s)]
*  and [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2818.94s)]
*  And my life was on a timer your siblings too. Yeah [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2820.2200000000003s)]
*  My life was on a timer I've never shared this but I would wake get woken up and then a timer would get turned on [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2824.42s)]
*  Five minutes what if that timer went off before I was spoke where I was supposed to be next I get beat [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2831.98s)]
*  And then the timer would be on where I was supposed to be next [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2837.9s)]
*  If I wasn't finished with my breakfast and in my bathroom brushing my teeth I get beat again [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2841.7s)]
*  But you know, I I think I think that is for me [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2847.2200000000003s)]
*  Part of why I rebelled so intensely [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2854.46s)]
*  Part of why I still when I make mistakes, they're so they're big ones, you know, I skipped the little ones [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2858.02s)]
*  I go straight to the big one. You know what I mean? It's like I'd rather make you know, man [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2863.7200000000003s)]
*  When am I gonna get to the point, you know, I'm 49 years old. When I get to the point where my my my [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2868.1s)]
*  Character defects when they manifest are small [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2873.7s)]
*  But at least they're not like I said, you know jack in an eight ball. Yeah [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2876.9s)]
*  Yeah, well that I think that right there explains why you'd be so hard on yourself if you had five minutes to do this [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2882.14s)]
*  You had five minutes to do that the way that that gets baked into [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2886.98s)]
*  Yeah, your own psyche as a child and you don't even know it right and then also, you know the spiritual abuse [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2889.7s)]
*  You know being being you know in touch with [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2897.7s)]
*  The spiritual world as a child, you know [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2903.62s)]
*  Creative we are and how we have fairy tale friends [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2906.86s)]
*  you know as a child and then you throw in the Bible in that mindset when you're developing and your brain is developing and [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2909.98s)]
*  That becomes reality and so you're reading the Bible and you're understanding at least from my life and [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2916.34s)]
*  And it's it's real, you know David and Goliath and and angels, you know appearing in the middle of the night [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2923.6200000000003s)]
*  That could really happen. That's real. God is real. He's right here. And so when you make a mistake [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2930.44s)]
*  Man, it's just so you know, you feel such guilt because you know [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2936.42s)]
*  You're gonna burn in hell and that's just baked that's baked into you [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2941.02s)]
*  And so I think that that can create what we're talking about, you know, why we're so hard on ourselves even when we're separated [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2944.58s)]
*  From that type of right belief system. Yeah, totally. Yeah, it's just big. It's just built. I'm built [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2952.3s)]
*  That's the foundation of my of my psyche. Yeah [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2957.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2961.7400000000002s)]
*  And so right. It's not just your religious relay. It's not just your religious [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2962.6200000000003s)]
*  Intellect that's created there your own your own intellect and recipe of who you are [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2968.02s)]
*  Right is established outside of the religious part of it or not, right? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2972.98s)]
*  And I still have those rebellious moments even at my age where I'm just like screw it [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2976.54s)]
*  I'm gonna do it and those are the character defects that I continue to work on [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2983.26s)]
*  Yeah, but I tell you the the guilt and shame that come with that [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2987.34s)]
*  You know, I guess it's there to make me a better person [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2992.3s)]
*  You know, and I guess that's what we're trying to be [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2996.34s)]

*  Realized a while ago. I'm not a victim now when I was a minor. I [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3375.64s)]
*  Was a victim right? I couldn't control that situation. I had no choice [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3382.0s)]
*  but as I became an adult I [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3387.24s)]
*  Volunteered for everything that I did. Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm not a victim. Okay, there were consequences to every decision that I made [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3390.52s)]
*  And I can't blame anymore I have to own it and I have to accept responsibility for it and that's hard because you know [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  It's best something [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3408.3199999999997s)]
*  Because you can look at people sometimes and say well [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3410.0s)]
*  Hey, I never would have done that to you and you did that to me and then I did this because you did that to me [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3412.3199999999997s)]

*  You know, but we all have a choice no matter what people do to us. We have a choice on how we react to it [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3422.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know if you've heard that expression [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3427.16s)]

*  So now I'm gonna go eff me. Oh [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3437.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying you screwed me over now [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3441.56s)]
*  I'm gonna go drink five bottles of Jack and and get all this other stuff and go screw myself up even more [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3444.0s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know and that and that's that you did you did that? Yeah, I did that [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3450.08s)]
*  100% that's how that's how I dealt with my problems for a number of years [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3454.6s)]
*  So I dealt with my pain and my hurt me then I'm gonna do this to me. Why is it? What is that thing? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3458.12s)]
*  I don't know man. It's insanity. I'm gonna do it to me to show you [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3464.78s)]
*  That only I hurt me is it I don't know. It's subconscious, right? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3469.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's trying to it's something that I didn't even know I was doing until I got away from it [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3473.52s)]
*  And had a chance to look at it because it makes no sense [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3478.12s)]
*  You know, why would you go do more damage [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3481.8799999999997s)]
*  To a situation and to your place in life because you're hurt by somebody else. That's insanity. It doesn't make any sense, right? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3485.56s)]
*  That's the pattern I got into for a long period of time [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3492.2s)]
*  I'm thinking on and I'm trying to feel on it and think on at the same time and I'm feeling like oh [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3495.2s)]
*  Well, I'm gonna show you the only person that hurts me is me and I'm not saying that that's you [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3500.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of like why a behavior like that would happen [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3506.16s)]
*  Well, I think for me it may have been to numb the pain I was such a sense [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3509.76s)]
*  I'm such a sensitive person same [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3513.32s)]
*  That I get hurt so easily that when I feel betrayed or feel hurt I don't want to feel that way anymore [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3516.48s)]
*  And so I would numb it and so in numbing that with substances and with alcohol [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3524.4s)]
*  That's how I was screwing myself even more because the consequences of what that numbing would bring into my life [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3530.0s)]
*  So it was an insane cycle and in and just at some level I do the same thing [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3538.28s)]
*  Now just not with substances. Yeah [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3545.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, I'll be hurt [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3548.6000000000004s)]
*  I'll be I'll feel it so deeply [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3551.0800000000004s)]
*  And and my way now is to isolate [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3554.7200000000003s)]
*  Shut down [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3560.36s)]
*  And it just all the ways that I've handled it just makes the problem worse it doesn't make it any better [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3562.12s)]
*  You know, so I'm really really trying to learn to to on a daily basis [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3568.88s)]
*  Especially with people that I love and even people at Starbucks who like tell you to f off because you bumped into them with your arm [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3574.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, man, what are they going through? They must got something going on in their life [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3581.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? Oh, you know, right to have some compassion [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3585.2s)]
*  Compassion and and and then just put myself in other people's shoes. Yeah, but not be so hard [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3588.52s)]
*  Yeah, like I can totally relate to that like to isolate. These are the things I'm gonna do something's uncomfortable something hurt me [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3593.6s)]
*  I'm gonna do these things. Yeah, that's what I do. I go hide I go hide and it makes sense as a child [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3600.96s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense a child would do that like behavior. Yeah, man. It's a very childlike behavior [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3606.08s)]
*  But it's hard some people don't understand it is hard to [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3611.6s)]
*  Get those things out of your system it is [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3615.52s)]
*  It's like the wiring is that it is the wiring and it's probably something I'll be battling [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3619.04s)]
*  Yeah for battle of always yeah always for the rest of my life and I think just sitting here talking about it with you [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3624.14s)]
*  Is gonna help me hopefully [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3630.68s)]
*  Move forward even if it's an inch to yeah, I'll take that inch [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3633.28s)]
*  Thanks, man. Yeah, I think even shit, you know, like I know a lot of I know there's a lot of guys that deal with that that thing [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3636.84s)]
*  Why do I still? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3642.8s)]
*  Practice the behaviors of a child when things in my life get tough. Yep [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3644.52s)]
*  100% [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3650.92s)]
*  100% [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3653.48s)]
*  What are so eight years ago things got rough? How were you? Did you were you like I had a I had a massive [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3654.64s)]
*  You're in a motel like how bad a massive relapse [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3660.2s)]
*  As you had some sobriety for a while at that. Yeah, you know, I was white knuckling it here there and trying to do it on my own [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3664.08s)]
*  Never listened to anyone who had you know long-term so hard to listen to people. Yeah [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3670.96s)]
*  Thought I could handle it didn't really want to be sober. Yeah, I wanted to be normal [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3677.4s)]
*  Why can't I be normal like everybody else man? Why can't I figure it out? Yeah, why can't I have a couple glasses of wine? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3682.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know, why can't I have a few beers, you know? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3688.4s)]
*  Oh, it was only when I brought this into my life that alcohol then turned into some huge issue, right? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3691.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, but if this isn't there then this will be fine [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3698.0s)]
*  And and so I would try yeah [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3701.0s)]
*  And I realized that as soon as I brought the alcohol back in my life [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3702.6800000000003s)]
*  It led to this and then this led to this and so it was just this this death spiral [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3706.6s)]
*  Yeah crack a mole or something. Yeah, exactly. You know, I end up like Hunter Biden [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3712.4s)]
*  You know what I mean, but but I've had some yeah, yeah and and and and and then [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3719.84s)]
*  You know, so I jumped in my truck during my last relapse and [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3725.6s)]
*  Drove from where were you? What's what's your relapse drove from Florida Florida man? Yeah [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3732.44s)]
*  I was a Florida man in my truck. Yeah [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3737.16s)]
*  And decided I'd drive to California, you know in little circles [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3741.68s)]
*  All over the United States, I mean it made sense in the state that I was in in my mind [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3749.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3754.76s)]
*  Till I ran out of money [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3755.96s)]
*  And you know being the loving family that I have [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3757.96s)]
*  You know, that was the only thing they could think of to do was to cut you off cut me off [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3761.28s)]
*  You know make sure I had no access so I wouldn't continue to spiral to your own money. Yeah [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3765.56s)]
*  Wow, yeah, you got to do that. You got to do that if someone's on death wish [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3770.08s)]
*  And and and you know, I appreciate that [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3774.6s)]
*  and so but anyway, you know, I did that and and [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3778.84s)]
*  During that process [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3783.1600000000003s)]
*  On the road the 10 man. I just put on the GPS and and somehow I ended up in [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3785.44s)]
*  Places that just make absolute no sense whatsoever [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3792.1600000000003s)]
*  You know my wife asked me one time she was you know, when you were on that trip, why were you in San Angelo, Texas? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3796.4s)]
*  I was like, I have no idea and then she's like and then why'd you go from there back to Mississippi and [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3802.6800000000003s)]
*  And and and I'm like I have no idea I was just following the GPS, you know [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3809.84s)]
*  So I guess it would reroute, you know your GPS will reroute sometimes [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3813.6200000000003s)]
*  And so I and I don't even know why I was headed to California. You got a Lewis and Clark edition [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3816.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think I did I I actually believe I had one of the most intense and incredible [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3821.56s)]
*  spiritual experiences [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3828.44s)]
*  of my entire life I [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3830.52s)]
*  I [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3833.52s)]
*  Have never really got into the details of everything that I went through on that trip [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3835.44s)]
*  in my psyche [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3840.3999999999996s)]
*  But everything coming out of me and and and everything that was going on, you know, it really did a number on my brain [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3842.8399999999997s)]
*  And I'll never forget it [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3850.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, I had some experiences that were I think akin [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3854.3999999999996s)]
*  To to what some people feel like they have when they go to Peru and do what's that? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3858.36s)]
*  I awoke Haya waska. Yeah, or or another [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3862.96s)]
*  Mescaline or some spiritual experience. I had that kind of experience, you know, there was a there was a moment where I felt and I saw [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3867.6s)]
*  An angel on the hood of my truck [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3876.0s)]
*  And I was following that angel wherever it was taking me and I had a bunch of stuff [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3878.36s)]
*  I had thrown into the back of my car. I had like three dolly paintings [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3883.08s)]
*  Dolly Parton dolly. Oh Salvador Dali, right Wow, and somehow I end up at a Catholic Church [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3887.0s)]
*  Somewhere in Mississippi or in Louisiana, yeah [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3895.24s)]
*  And I just felt like I should pull over and give those dolly paintings to that church [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3899.16s)]
*  So I'm carrying them in and there's no one there [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3905.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like the middle of the night and I set them down and then the priest walks out and I said hey man [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3907.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know why I'm here. I think God brought me here to give you these paintings [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3912.6s)]
*  And he goes man are our schools about to shut down because we don't have funding [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3915.66s)]
*  Thank you [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3921.54s)]
*  And then I just took off [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3923.54s)]
*  And now he eventually got in touch with me like two or three years later and and returned them once you know [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3927.02s)]
*  But I got back on their feet [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3932.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think once he realized or at least had heard that that maybe I wasn't in my right state of mind [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3935.06s)]
*  At the time but even to this day I feel like I feel like I was supposed to be there [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3942.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm never sure that with anybody but I feel like I was supposed to be there [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3946.46s)]
*  I feel like I was supposed to give him those [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3949.42s)]
*  I don't know why I feel that way inside but I do well the act of us also the act of giving something that means [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3951.9s)]
*  Something to you giving it away to somebody else sharing [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3958.46s)]
*  I think all those things are like sometimes clues that we can get out of actions that we get led to do [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3962.38s)]
*  You know, sometimes it's not even about that exact action [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3967.0600000000004s)]
*  But this the feelings that it are the it's not about the exact thing but it's about the action, you know [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3969.94s)]
*  Sometimes it's a reminder of the value of it. Yeah, I mean [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3976.3s)]
*  At the time I felt like I was on some type of spiritual [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3981.86s)]
*  Or in the middle of some type of spiritual experience. It's [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3986.38s)]
*  now do you was that like a [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3990.5s)]
*  Were you did you think you were you having like a breakdown then kind of you think I think so. Yeah [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3992.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah a lot of people have because things were coming out of my body [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=3996.9s)]
*  and [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=4000.82s)]

*  Like for me, I'll use my my example, you know, Jim Morrison was one of those and so I thought that [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5180.62s)]
*  You know a guy a lead singer in a band and a rock star was supposed to do everything that Jim Morrison did [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5187.9s)]
*  Not even thinking that it's what killed him. I thought I was supposed to do that. It was my rite of passage [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5194.62s)]
*  And so I can't say that that's what everyone else thought but definitely the rock-and-roll lifestyle [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5200.74s)]
*  Was something that I thought was just you know part of the job description [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5207.58s)]
*  And and had no foresight or knowledge that it could kill me. Mm-hmm [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5212.38s)]
*  Yeah, I guess there is there's that will I have to be like a rock star? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5218.3s)]
*  What a fucking pressure it sounds great, right until you get there and have to do it right and that's what I love about a [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5224.62s)]
*  lot of this generation of [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5232.46s)]
*  Upcoming musicians and artists in all genres is sobriety is cool. Yeah being responsible is cool [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5235.34s)]
*  Showing up is cool being on time is putting on a good show is cool [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5244.26s)]
*  You know and and and so hopefully that that's the impression that the next generation will see and that's what I try to tell [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5249.82s)]
*  These young up and comers that I run into [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5259.139999999999s)]
*  And but that's what I'm seeing on the streets. Yeah in in my business. Yes. Same as in comedy [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5262.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you see a lot of it a lot of the a lot of great comedians are sober or a lot of you know [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5268.259999999999s)]
*  Working comedians are sober, right? I don't know how people could do it not being sober [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5272.94s)]
*  Looking back. I don't know how I did it at times [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5279.04s)]
*  You know at the end in order to get there. I couldn't I couldn't do it [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5283.04s)]
*  Had I been in some kind of you know pervasive active and active addiction? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5288.56s)]
*  But at the end I was and I look at look at that and I'm I'm like [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5293.12s)]
*  I don't know how I I did it that last a couple years, but definitely didn't do it. Well, yeah [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5296.64s)]

*  100% yeah, I mean it's it's it's what you it's what you have to do to clear the wreckage of your past [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5313.78s)]
*  That's what you have to do. I think to move forward, you know, I just used recovery lingo you get it [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5320.42s)]
*  But to those that aren't in in a recovery program or know the lingo [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5325.92s)]
*  In order sometimes to move forward and grow as a human being you do have to clear up the past especially [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5331.54s)]
*  Yeah with the people that you've hurt [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5337.42s)]
*  And also I had to forgive and get rid of resentments [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5340.38s)]
*  And like you were talking about a couple of them took a long time [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5345.54s)]
*  I mean I can name it [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5348.86s)]

*  And I almost like I don't want to thank [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5357.84s)]
*  Kovat for happening, but it sure did push me into a deeper [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5361.5599999999995s)]
*  Spiritual journey and a deeper place of self-awareness and growth than I would have been had it not happened [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5366.5599999999995s)]
*  And it and it definitely allowed me to have the time and the space [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5374.08s)]
*  mentally and emotionally [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5379.2s)]
*  To resolve some of those resentments that I just could not let go of Wow [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5380.8s)]

*  Yeah, so that's where I went every day [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5905.32s)]

*  My birth name is Anthony [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5913.8s)]
*  And so she she said Anthony, what are you doing in here? And I was like, well, this is where I have to come to school [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5916.4400000000005s)]
*  And she was really [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5923.2s)]

*  Because I did I don't know why I did I just did and and needed a trim [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5931.4s)]
*  And and I like to stand up on my desk and dance when the teacher would turn her back [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5935.8s)]
*  you like to act out yeah, and [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5939.96s)]
*  You know and I just I guess I prevented others from learning [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5942.48s)]
*  And so so she came in and she said hey, I want you to come to the gym after school [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5946.88s)]
*  and I [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5953.16s)]
*  Want to see if you're you interested in being in course? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5954.84s)]
*  And I said well I can sing like and I started singing to her all the songs that whatever on the radio like Phil [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5958.64s)]

*  And I'd be singing at the top of my lungs and whatever was on the radio. I could mimic [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5971.400000000001s)]
*  And I would mimic [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5977.16s)]
*  And so I had kind of a sense of pride in how I could sing [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5979.28s)]
*  And so when she brought that up, I was like, yeah, absolutely. I'll come [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5984.12s)]
*  And so I went to the gym after school and tried out and she's like, well, I like how you sing and [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=5988.36s)]

*  the crowd cheered and [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6006.0s)]
*  I [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6009.5199999999995s)]
*  Believe that was the beginning of the calling being manifest into my life and I owe it all [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6010.52s)]
*  to that music teacher [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6016.72s)]
*  Who asked me what I was doing in the principal's office every day? Ah [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6018.84s)]

*  Ready been written and we're just living it out. I wonder sometimes kind of crazy. I wonder sometimes [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6042.88s)]

*  bit of a concept of what that [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6069.12s)]
*  With the tangible world of that I had some very very strange experiences down in Florida now this down in Florida [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6072.56s)]
*  Yeah, this is where the Lord goes on vacations. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, Jesus is there right now. He's riding rides at Disney World. Yeah [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6079.44s)]
*  You know come to me, you know all the children [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6088.28s)]
*  but [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6092.2s)]
*  You know, they were speaking in tongues. It was prophesying [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6093.24s)]
*  You know Benny Hinn. Yeah, okay. We we went to his church really he prophesied over me when I was like nine years old [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6097.48s)]
*  I'll never forget it. I'm trying to find the tape because I know that he they filmed [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6104.679999999999s)]
*  yeah, there's got to be one huh, they filmed his his whatever but my parents visited his church and [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6110.04s)]
*  This is strange. This is a crazy story. He called everybody forward all the kids and [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6116.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, he was doing his deal where he walks by and touches your head and you fall down [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6121.72s)]
*  Mm-hmm bring a picture up a Benny Hinn there. Yeah, bring him up. Let's see this. Let's see this man. I [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6125.16s)]
*  Remember they used to do my dad used to drink and watch him [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6130.88s)]
*  There he is there's a man oh boy and and I think I've shared this story maybe one or two times [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6135.24s)]
*  Or maybe I wrote wrote about it in in my first book [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6141.92s)]
*  What was the book called this one? It's called sinners Creed [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6145.96s)]
*  Okay, now it was a little censored because it was with a Christian publisher a lot censored a lot of a lot of stuff that I [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6148.36s)]
*  let that you know, but [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6154.2s)]
*  So I went forward because all the kids went forward [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6156.96s)]
*  And I was determined that this man was not gonna push me down because I was convinced that that's what he was doing [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6160.28s)]
*  And so I was standing right next to a pew and I had my my left arm on the pew and I positioned my back foot [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6167.42s)]
*  You know like where I was I was bracing myself there ain't no way I'm falling down and [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6174.799999999999s)]
*  Man, everyone's dropping dropping dropping dropping and he gets up to me and he stops [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6180.0199999999995s)]
*  No lie, and he says this young man's gonna affect millions of people's lives [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6185.5199999999995s)]
*  And then started speaking in tongues and did his hand like that and I fell right to the floor. No way [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6191.28s)]
*  Yep, I'll never forget how I felt too. I [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6196.5199999999995s)]
*  felt like [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6199.5599999999995s)]
*  when I woke up [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6201.16s)]
*  Tears were coming down my face and I felt like I had just rinse my insides out with Listerine or scope [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6203.88s)]
*  That's how my insides felt. I'll never forget it. It's a true story man. And and and I'm telling you man. I tried [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6210.92s)]
*  With so I don't know what how he does it or you know, you know, they call it the Spirit of God [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6217.8s)]
*  But I it happened and and and it happened that day and I felt it so I had experiences like that, right [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6224.5199999999995s)]
*  Happen to me as a child [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6232.08s)]
*  Did you believe that it? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6234.08s)]
*  Did you believe that it had an effect on any of your do you you believe that you remember that over time or that part? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6236.64s)]
*  Absolutely. Wow, absolutely. I think it affected my ego [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6242.68s)]
*  And and I think it was a part of somewhere back there a part of my drive because I believed [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6246.04s)]
*  When I met mark and we started the band [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6253.320000000001s)]
*  You were not convincing me that we weren't gonna be the biggest rock band in the world [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6256.88s)]
*  I knew it. I already knew it right [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6261.2s)]
*  Nobody else did and there's a story and my band will tell you we had this drummer [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6264.28s)]
*  That kept not showing up [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6270.04s)]
*  for our bass player [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6273.0s)]
*  Who kept not showing up for band practice? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6275.16s)]
*  And so I fired him and I said you just missed out on being in the biggest rock band in the world [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6277.76s)]
*  And this is before we even played a show [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6283.12s)]
*  That's that's my [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6286.88s)]
*  Crazy but I was crazy right I was I was that guy but you have to maybe be that I was crazy and I believed it [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6288.88s)]
*  It was arrogant definitely an arrogant thing to say. Yeah, but I believed it. I believed it in my heart [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6296.6s)]
*  Somebody has to believe it though and and and the guys I think that conviction and that drive I think was contagious [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6303.52s)]
*  And and it happened for us and and [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6311.96s)]
*  The odds of that yeah, well I also think that that goes to you know a lot of people talk about you know [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6315.6s)]
*  manifestation and speaking things into [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6322.92s)]
*  Into existence and whatnot, and I don't know about where I sit and what I feel about all that stuff [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6326.4400000000005s)]
*  But if I look back on my life a lot of that played out [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6332.6s)]
*  You know a lot of that played out. It sounds like it. You know, it's powerful [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6337.360000000001s)]
*  I think about all the time that I spend talking or running things in my head that are unhelpful to me [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6341.46s)]
*  Not necessarily negative because I do do much less like [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6347.94s)]
*  Berating myself for things these days. I'm not as hard on myself. I can notice when it's popping up [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6352.26s)]
*  But how much if I just woke up into the world and said this is what I want [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6358.02s)]
*  You know [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6363.54s)]
*  This is what I would love this how few times do I have I done that in my life? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6365.22s)]
*  Spoken out into the living existing world and then take action the what my heart and not only to but also [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6372.14s)]
*  Then get a feeling of what the actions to take are but yes and believe it and believe it [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6379.54s)]
*  There was nobody that could tell me at the time different. I had blinders on and [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6384.82s)]
*  If you weren't in tune with my vision, I couldn't see you Wow [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6390.02s)]
*  and [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6395.1s)]
*  You know, it's crazy I was that crazy guy [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6396.94s)]
*  I absolutely was that crazy guy and then I was ended up being that crazy guy in public quite a few times. Yeah [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6398.94s)]
*  But you know, I think it takes a little bit of crazy [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6406.42s)]
*  like you like you had alluded to [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6410.139999999999s)]
*  to [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6413.42s)]
*  To make it and and to do what you got to do to make it. Yeah, it's it's hard [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6415.099999999999s)]
*  It's a hard. It's hard to make it. Yeah, it's hard to make it [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6421.219999999999s)]
*  It's hard to sustain it and it's so much [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6424.56s)]
*  Once you have some like because you want to get the most out of yourself [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6427.400000000001s)]
*  You want to get the most out of the opportunity? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6431.6s)]
*  Here's for me get scared of what steps you're supposed to take or what's supposed to be next kind of [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6433.88s)]
*  That's one of the first things that happens. I [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6439.72s)]
*  Remember I got this guy [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6442.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't say it was like a God complex for a while [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6443.92s)]
*  But I got like this like guys would call into the podcast that were struggling with stuff and I started thinking [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6446.200000000001s)]
*  Man God's using me. I absolutely had the same to help like [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6452.88s)]
*  I'm some and it was it was awesome because I think some of it might have been true that God was using me [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6457.92s)]
*  Because I had a voice and there were people who struggle with the same stuff [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6463.48s)]
*  I did but then part of me started it was like this is impossible. I can't help every single person [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6467.34s)]
*  I can't well, I think part of part of why I had that complex for a number of years was because [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6473.4s)]
*  My abusive stepfather had that complex and and then the types of churches that I went to [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6479.24s)]
*  imprinted that complex on [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6485.759999999999s)]
*  You really yeah, I mean you don't I mean just with with everything that they they would tell you [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6488.0s)]
*  About your destiny and about the plan and you know [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6495.12s)]
*  God has these enormous plans for your life and he's gonna use you to change the world. I mean [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6498.5199999999995s)]
*  I'd be delusional if I thought that I was the only one Benny Hinn said that to yeah [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6504.48s)]
*  I bet he said it to all of them, right? You know what I mean? So if you say it to everybody you're gonna get one, right? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6508.959999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean, so I think I think [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6515.799999999999s)]
*  growing up in that time of [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6518.839999999999s)]
*  Jim Baker and and Benny Hinn and the evangelical movement the assembly of God movement [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6521.679999999999s)]
*  They were imprinting that destiny on young people's [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6528.24s)]
*  minds so [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6532.68s)]
*  For everyone that did go on to do something that impacted [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6535.0s)]
*  you know their community or or their state or or [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6539.24s)]
*  The United States or the world if they were raised in that environment [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6544.88s)]
*  I'm sure they dealt with a little bit of a God complex if they grew up the same way and was programmed [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6549.04s)]
*  Is what I call it the same way that I was programmed growing up. Yeah program is wild man [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6555.56s)]
*  Did you guys ever have an amalia come into the thing? Did y'all ever do like it cuz I went to one church where they had I [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6561.88s)]
*  Went to a church that did you ever see the guy? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6568.72s)]
*  They uh, it was the [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6573.0s)]
*  Crystal Cathedral. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Remember that one with Robert Schiml [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6576.099999999999s)]
*  No, not Robert Schiml. No Schuller Schuller. Yes. Yeah with Schuller. Absolutely [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6581.44s)]
*  So those doors opened up on the back of the church [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6585.98s)]
*  I went I would go there sometimes with this older lady that I knew and I met her on this boat actually, but so [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6588.48s)]
*  We would go and one time as a lady sitting next to me the doors open up a butterfly comes in [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6595.839999999999s)]
*  Lands on this old lady's face. I mean just lands right in her makeup and I said to her I said hey [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6601.4s)]
*  You have a butterfly in your face. She goes. Oh, that's my son [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6606.759999999999s)]
*  She said he died in a car accident like 14 years ago and today's his birthday [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6609.2s)]
*  And sometimes he comes and visits me when I come here Wow [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6613.24s)]
*  It was just a crazy experience, but I remember that that was what a church where [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6616.719999999999s)]
*  Where I took um where it was on television and stuff. Yeah, you know, yeah [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6622.36s)]
*  Anyway, uh, I feel like we've talked about a pretty good bit man. Do you think [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6629.32s)]
*  We sure have I've talked about things. I've never talked about really. Yeah, I've never shared some of this stuff and I think it's cool [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6635.16s)]
*  To that we've opened up these doors because it it [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6642.22s)]
*  It can give me a perspective. It's giving me a unique perspective on how my mindset was [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6646.38s)]
*  At the time and we're all a product I guess of how we were raised. Yeah [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6653.18s)]
*  And and what was put inside of us at our formative years [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6658.34s)]
*  I know and then we're all battling though [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6663.14s)]
*  It's like it's like and then we get away and then we get to a point where we're like, well, who am I? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6665.14s)]
*  Outside of this right [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6670.66s)]
*  Do I believe this because it was put in me since I was a child or [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6673.66s)]
*  Am I choosing to believe in this because it's really my choice [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6680.7s)]
*  And that's where for me I decided to go the polar opposite direction [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6684.780000000001s)]
*  for a time [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6689.780000000001s)]
*  And paid the price [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6691.14s)]
*  You mean the polar opposite direction what not doing music or not living that lifestyle? Oh, not doing music [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6692.66s)]
*  Not living a lifestyle that I was raised in the Christian world [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6700.06s)]
*  Oh, I see, you know, but did it make kind of like, you know, I used to rationalize with God [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6704.78s)]
*  In my prayers and I'd say well God how am I supposed to help a drug addict if I don't become a drug addict? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6709.74s)]
*  Oh, wow [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6717.02s)]
*  How am I supposed to help someone struggling with alcohol if I don't drink and and you know [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6718.22s)]
*  I used to rationalize that and [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6724.78s)]
*  Literally, this was my prayers [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6726.78s)]
*  How am I supposed to help someone with with with you know a problem with women if I don't? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6728.139999999999s)]
*  Right, you know if I don't get out here and get out and and and be that guy [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6733.9s)]
*  And and that was my that was my rationale to God God. I'm doing you know, God [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6739.58s)]
*  I'm doing this because I want to help people. Yeah, that's some bull crap in it right there [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6745.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's just interest in how we could I'm trying to think if I can relate to that [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6750.74s)]
*  I can certainly relate to and I'm sure a lot of people can have like [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6756.1s)]
*  Knowing what I'm doing isn't good for me or right and continuing to do it [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6763.14s)]
*  yeah, you know, I absolutely did that but for me having the the you know, the [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6768.96s)]
*  The indoctrination that I had how can I do this if I don't have the experience right right? Wow [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6774.46s)]
*  That's interest, right and I used to use the reference of [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6781.46s)]
*  Of Solomon in the Bible in my prayers with God. I was like I was like God, you know [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6786.46s)]
*  you made him the wisest man on the planet and [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6791.82s)]
*  He went out and did everything against you and experienced everything under the Sun [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6796.06s)]
*  You know worship other gods did every drug [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6801.22s)]
*  You know did other religions and whatnot and and so I would use Bible stories [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6804.34s)]
*  Oh, wow that I had been told to discuss with God right as as like well God how am I supposed to do this? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6809.700000000001s)]
*  You know what? I mean, and this is when I was younger and thought that I was supposed to be you know [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6817.22s)]
*  A preacher or have some kind of spiritual calling on my life, which I ended up on the flip side [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6821.54s)]
*  Having happened anyway, I did end up [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6827.38s)]
*  You know having an impact [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6831.22s)]
*  For God right through my music. Yeah, even though I ran the complete opposite direction [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6834.26s)]
*  That's how we were talking about earlier about God will use you despite yourself [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6838.42s)]
*  At least I believe but the excuses that I used to make for sin damn were in were incredible [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6842.42s)]
*  We're incredible. Well, and also the fact that you thought that you had to you know, like which I mean [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6848.26s)]
*  Of course you do if you have a relationship with God [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6852.42s)]
*  Then you're gonna have to have some communication with and even through all that even through the darkest times in my life [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6854.42s)]
*  I still would be communicating and talking with God [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6861.46s)]
*  Even even though I was living as far away from a life of someone who's a Christian or someone who [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6865.62s)]
*  Is in in the church or someone who knows right and wrong? I would still be in communication with God [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6871.78s)]
*  I would still be in communication with God [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6878.26s)]
*  um [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6881.860000000001s)]
*  And make you know trying to rationalize, you know what I was doing [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6883.22s)]
*  Um, it was really really really really was it painful really dark place a bad really not a good place [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6887.46s)]
*  to be in [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6894.42s)]
*  And uh a place that I never want to go back to yeah [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6895.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because you're almost playing hide and go seek with [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6900.34s)]
*  Who you really want to be and stuff right? Oh, well, you're not being authentic [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=6902.740000000001s)]
