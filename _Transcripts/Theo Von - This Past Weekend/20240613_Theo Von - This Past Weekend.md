# Investigative Journalist Nate Halverson  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #510
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w)
*  Today's guest is an independent writer, journalist, and reporter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=0.0s)]
*  He contributed to the documentary The Grab, which is all about the money and power controlling [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4.92s)]
*  the food industry in America and beyond. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=9.86s)]
*  Outside of that, he writes for the Center for Investigative Reporting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=13.56s)]
*  I'm really fascinated to spend time with today's guest, Nate Halverson. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=17.28s)]
*  I'm going to stay for you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=22.84s)]
*  Nate Halverson, thanks for coming, man. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=49.84s)]
*  Dude, you kidding me? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=51.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=52.36s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate it, man. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  I watched The Grab, which is the documentary that you guys are putting out. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  And just so I'm clear, what was the goal of the documentary? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=60.16s)]
*  Because to me, it seemed like you're trying to show that a lot of land or arable land, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=64.52s)]
*  is that land that can grow crops? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=73.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=74.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=75.12s)]
*  A lot of land that can sustain crops is being bought up by different countries, that it's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=75.76s)]
*  kind of like a land grab for that land right now, because they're not making more of it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=82.92s)]
*  That's it, man. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=89.64s)]
*  I mean, it is in the 21st century, it's looking more like, you know, oil was the commodity [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  of the 20th century, you know, gold, diamonds, these things. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=95.84s)]
*  But in the 21st century, it looks like the rich and powerful are increasingly turning [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=98.48s)]
*  to control food and water as, you know, like the basic necessities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=103.6s)]
*  And we're just seeing a ton, whether it's foreign governments, you know, wealthy Wall [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  Street corporations are all beginning to turn to it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=112.8s)]
*  You know, I think now Bill Gates's family, they're the largest farmers in the U.S., right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=116.08s)]
*  Like they have, they're now the largest farmland owners in the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=122.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's interesting because he's obviously a guy with a lot of foresight, a guy who's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=125.6s)]
*  able to kind of envision the next step, obviously, from his past, from his history of being [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=129.48s)]
*  able to like acquire companies that are doing that in different realms. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  You kind of broke this story that this was happening years ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=141.72s)]
*  Yeah, because before this, I mean, before I started working on this, dude, I do nothing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=145.28s)]
*  about any of this. Right. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=148.76s)]
*  Like I came into a cold turkey and I was asked to look at China's largest meat company [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=150.0s)]
*  buying the world's largest pork company, which was based in Virginia. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=157.56s)]
*  And at the time, Congress was kind of freaking out, you know, like is China buying, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=162.4s)]
*  our meat supply? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=167.16s)]
*  And so I was asked to look into it because I had this background and dig it into Hong Kong [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=169.72s)]
*  financials where this meat company was publicly traded. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=174.64s)]
*  And I went to China, I talked to folks in the U.S., I talked to people in U.S. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=178.68s)]
*  intelligence. And it turns out, yeah, like the Chinese government was behind this purchase [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=183.6s)]
*  that's effectively one in four American pigs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=189.12s)]
*  And the reason is because the Chinese government kind of clued into something before other [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=192.0s)]
*  folks, which is that in the 21st century, food is power. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=196.92s)]
*  Right. Like you need to control food to control your political future. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=200.6s)]
*  And so the Chinese government began putting into these five year plans that they put out an [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=205.04s)]
*  effort to go overseas and begin buying up food and water resources so that they could control it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=211.2s)]
*  So it's a strategy that was happening. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Definitely. Right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=220.0s)]
*  And so they want to get the pigs because that's a source of food. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=221.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's a source of food. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=224.72s)]
*  And that's a source of, you know, for China, political stability. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=226.16s)]
*  Right. If you have food, then the people will eventually follow you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=230.04s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you'll do anything to eat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=232.48s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=235.2s)]
*  And and, you know, like I've now traveled the world, that was like the first one that the first [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  food story that I looked at, you know, and I thought like, OK, it's a story about food. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a story about farming. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, so I was surprised when I'll you know, then I'm talking to U.S. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  intelligence people. Right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=249.88s)]
*  And then I'm talking to like people in the Defense Department. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. Like all of a sudden, food is this like big national security. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=253.92s)]
*  And so as I began traveling the world, I mean, I began going to other countries where those [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=257.4s)]
*  governments were using the food supply to control the population. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=261.8s)]
*  Right. And I think that's what people are worried about going forward into the 21st [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=266.12s)]
*  century is that by controlling the food, you can control the people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=270.64s)]
*  Right. They're just thinking, OK, how do we need to control the people next? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=274.96s)]
*  How do we still have control over people? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=278.48s)]
*  And they start to look at what could become a scarcity. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=280.56s)]
*  Yeah. And they believe it's food. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=284.52s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And so like the country I had gone to was was Venezuela and Venezuela at [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=286.32s)]
*  the time was having all these food riots. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=291.56s)]
*  Right. Like people, people you would go and you'd work your nine to five job and then [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  you'd come home and there'd literally be a one mile line, long line to get into the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  grocery store. And there's no way you're going to work like a 10 hour day and then stand [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=302.48s)]
*  in line all night. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=306.2s)]
*  Right. And then go back. And so, you know, I was talking to these guys that were working [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=307.68s)]
*  class that had jobs and they were literally eating out of dumpsters. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  I saw these dudes eating raw meat. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=314.88s)]
*  Right. And he's like, I've got a job. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  He's like, I just can't afford food. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=317.92s)]
*  And so then I went to this, you know, like secret location, this this this warehouse [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=321.0s)]
*  full of food after watching people like starving people, people scraping by trying to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  survive without food in Venezuela. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=332.04s)]
*  I went to this government warehouse full of food on a Sunday when it was supposed to be [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=334.36s)]
*  closed. And who was there? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=338.48s)]
*  It was a bunch of Venezuelan military and police. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=340.88s)]
*  They were open. The government has opening it up. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  And these guys, these big buff dudes were wheeling out cart fulls of food that like I [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=347.76s)]
*  hadn't seen in like my one week there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=352.68s)]
*  And they were giving the authority like the authorities were giving the police and the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=354.64s)]
*  military, the guys that were knocking down the population food so that they would, of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  course, continue to control the population. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=363.56s)]
*  Wow. But how do you start to see that it becomes a bigger story, though? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=365.44s)]
*  I mean, I just it was crazy, man, because I just started seeing these dots like these [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=370.4s)]
*  stories that you would see around the world, you know, like, oh, this country is running [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=375.44s)]
*  low on food and its people are migrating out or like this this country just bought up, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=379.16s)]
*  you know, like half the farmland in like Madagascar, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=383.92s)]
*  You know, like when I think Daiwu out of South Korea bought up like made like a secret [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=387.36s)]
*  deal for like half the farmland in Madagascar. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=391.52s)]
*  And then the people rise up and overthrow in the countries in civil war. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=393.96s)]
*  And you you begin seeing these stories and then you begin being like, oh, my God, like [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=396.6s)]
*  all of these seemingly separate stories are all connected as part of this like bigger [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=400.56s)]
*  trend. Right. And that's when I began tapping into people who were beginning to follow [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=406.04s)]
*  it like in the shadows, right, like the government, the intelligence community, others [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=411.88s)]
*  were beginning to sort of piece this together. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=416.24s)]
*  But for my reporting anyway, it appears that like it really was the Chinese government [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=419.04s)]
*  was probably the first to wake up to this, to really tap into it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=424.6s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. I mean, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=428.12s)]
*  the leadership of China went through the Great Famine, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=430.24s)]
*  Like Xi Jinping has told stories about living through the Great Famine, which was the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=434.04s)]
*  late 50s when estimates are that like, man, thirty seven million people died as a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  result of starvation in China, in China. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=446.44s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. And so when you go through a period where you're looking around and do [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=449.04s)]
*  I've heard, I mean, like stories I don't even like to tell because they're so awful [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=454.24s)]
*  about what it's like. You know, if you have thirty seven million people that actually [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=458.68s)]
*  died as a result of starvation, that means you got like a hundred million people that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=462.08s)]
*  are close. Right. And people are just like doing desperate, crazy things. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=465.28s)]
*  And so when the leadership of China can remember that, like they are more keyed in when [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=470.32s)]
*  that trend starts poking up its head when there are these, you know, when there are [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=475.2s)]
*  these forecasts, things are going to get more and more dire in the future. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=480.56s)]
*  They moved quickly to begin to sort of control food and water supplies for their [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  population. Right. So they're kind of like, obviously they're a little more sensitive [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=488.67999999999995s)]
*  to it. But, but you notice that they were kind of at the head of the trend. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=492.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. My father grew up in Nicaragua and he grew up there like in the 1910s. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  OK. And so he would tell me stories about people starving and kids in his village and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=501.96s)]
*  stuff eating dirt and like their stomachs becoming distended. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  That's right. Literally making dirt like people say mud pies and stuff that kids make [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=510.68s)]
*  like, but literally making mud pies and eating them, you know, just to like be able to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=516.4s)]
*  put something like, right, you're putting something in. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=520.96s)]
*  Yeah. Where in Nicaragua was your dad? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=523.08s)]
*  He's from Bluefield, Nicaragua. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=525.72s)]
*  Oh, sure. Out in the coast. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=527.52s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm not, I know his, some of his family was down there being missionaries and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=528.68s)]
*  that's how his parents met each other. But yeah, he would just tell me stories like that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  when I was a kid and it was just, it was unbelievable. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=538.52s)]
*  I mean, I've even thought I've been on a fast for a couple of days and seen and this is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=541.48s)]
*  a little off topic, I guess, but I seen a guy at Best Buy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=547.0799999999999s)]
*  I had been on a fast for four days. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=550.84s)]
*  I seen a guy at Best Buy. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=552.52s)]
*  Yeah. And I was like, I will, I could, I could eat that guy. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=553.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was. And it was like, I'd never had a thought like that before. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=561.16s)]
*  I've been to Best Buy probably 70 times and I'd never thought, you know what, I could [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=563.96s)]
*  eat one of these sales attendants or whatever, but it was just in my head. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=567.68s)]
*  It was like a little bit of that hunger was like, what are we going to do here if this [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=571.68s)]
*  guy looks the other way? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=574.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I know, man. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  It's weird. Like, and that's what it comes down to. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=577.4799999999999s)]
*  And that's the thing that like, and then people are surprised. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=579.92s)]
*  They're like, why are all these Venezuelans coming to our border? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  And you're like, because they're hungry. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=585.52s)]
*  They've been staring at other people thinking about eating them. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=587.7199999999999s)]
*  So they're like, maybe it's time to leave. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=589.88s)]
*  Yeah. You don't even think that that's one of the reasons why people were coming up. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=592.24s)]
*  What are some of the other dots you start to connect? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=596.0s)]
*  Because I see in the documentary, there's like land that's bought in Arizona. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=597.64s)]
*  There's a huge focus on land that's bought in Africa. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=601.76s)]
*  Like, what are some of the other dots you start to connect that really make this in [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=605.52s)]
*  your mind, like bring it to a boil kind of besides just paranoid Chinese like and with [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=610.04s)]
*  with forethought? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=615.52s)]
*  Yeah, right. I mean, you're right. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=616.92s)]
*  It was it was all over the place. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=619.56s)]
*  It was like, you know, I began thinking, OK, so if China [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=621.12s)]
*  is focused on this, like what other, you know, wealthy countries are focused on this? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=625.0s)]
*  And and, you know, lo and behold, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was one. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=630.16s)]
*  Right. Because believe it or not, even though it's a desert country, it had these [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=635.32s)]
*  huge underground water reserves, aquifers underneath the desert. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=640.68s)]
*  And that's why, like, you know, there are springs, you know, flowing to the surface of [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=645.56s)]
*  the desert that are mentioned in the Bible, 2000, whatever years ago. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=649.8s)]
*  And started in like the 90s, they began using their oil derricks to tap into that water [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=653.4s)]
*  and actually use that water to grow wheat in the desert. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=660.6s)]
*  So this like wheat country by the 90s was the world's sixth largest exporter of wheat. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=664.52s)]
*  Well, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=670.12s)]
*  But, dude, that water doesn't last. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=672.12s)]
*  Right. And so they drained it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=674.12s)]
*  And so like those springs that are mentioned from 2000 years ago, they wouldn't dry. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=676.84s)]
*  Gosh. And so then it's like, where are they going to go? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=680.5200000000001s)]
*  And that was the question I had in my head. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=683.8800000000001s)]
*  OK, so like if they drained their water with this program, like where are they? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=686.2s)]
*  Yeah, and that's when I found them in, like, the Arizona desert. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=690.96s)]
*  I'm talking like saguaro, cactuses, wiley coyote, like desert, desert. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=694.44s)]
*  Yeah. And they were doing the same thing, pumping up this ancient water that doesn't [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=698.96s)]
*  get replenished from rain because it's there from like the last ice age or something. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=703.08s)]
*  And then they use that water right there to grow alfalfa. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=706.84s)]
*  And then they ship the alfalfa from Arizona, basically to Los Angeles, put it on a ship [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=710.84s)]
*  and then ship that alfalfa, which is hay, all the way back to Saudi Arabia, because [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=715.64s)]
*  that's how you move water. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=719.88s)]
*  Like you couldn't fill enough oil tankers full of water to effectively move water. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=721.4s)]
*  What you do is if your water short, you use the water wherever it is to grow the crops. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=726.2s)]
*  And then you ship the crops because we use 70 to 80 percent of our the water, fresh water [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=731.08s)]
*  around the world. We use it for food. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=735.24s)]
*  That's what we need fresh water for. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=737.48s)]
*  OK, so if one entity shows up in another space and you and grows a crop, really what [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=738.92s)]
*  they're using is water. That's the real resource because they could grow it at home if they [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=744.68s)]
*  had the water. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=748.92s)]
*  100 percent. China doesn't have the water to grow enough food to feed its population. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=749.68s)]
*  Wow. And even with the pigs, does that come back to water, too, or no? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=754.1999999999999s)]
*  Even more so because, right, like you can you can grow alfalfa in the Arizona desert [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  and then you can ship all that alfalfa back to Saudi Arabia. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=762.84s)]
*  Or like in the case of pigs, you can grow all of the grain that the pigs are going to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  eat here in the U.S. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=772.28s)]
*  And then you feed that grain to the pigs and then you ship the pigs back. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  And so like a pig is an even more concentrated form of water. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=777.64s)]
*  They call it like virtual waters, what an economist would call it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=782.12s)]
*  Wow. So wait, explain that part to me more time about the pig. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=784.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So like, yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=789.96s)]
*  So you would grow the grain here. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=792.1999999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=793.8s)]
*  With the water here. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=794.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=795.4s)]
*  And then you would feed the pig here. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  Yep. And then you then you slaughter the pig here and then you send the meat back. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=798.52s)]
*  Right. And so now you've used the water to grow the grain here. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=804.8399999999999s)]
*  And animals require a lot of livestock feed. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  So it takes even more grain than if like you were just eating like a meat free diet. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  It takes just more water to eat a meat filled diet. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=815.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=817.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=817.88s)]
*  Yeah. And so then you grow the grains here, you feed it to the pig. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=818.28s)]
*  The pig craps all over the place. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  You end up with these like giant manure lagoons, which are toxic. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=824.68s)]
*  Those are here and you slaughter the pig and then you ship the meat back. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=827.88s)]
*  So you get stuck with the shit and they get the meat. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=831.16s)]
*  Wow. And so how does like for the example in Arizona, how does that affect like Americans? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=834.12s)]
*  Like how does that affect us? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=841.16s)]
*  Totally. So like when I broke that story about the Saudis in the Arizona desert in 2015, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=842.5999999999999s)]
*  the locals didn't know. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=848.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=849.64s)]
*  They knew that their groundwater, the well that the water that they relied on for their homes, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=850.76s)]
*  like it was getting lower every single year. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=856.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=858.6s)]
*  What they didn't know was that some other country had run out of water [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=859.1600000000001s)]
*  and come here to grab that water. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=861.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=863.24s)]
*  And so when I broke that story, people are like, yeah, it's like our water has been going down [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=863.88s)]
*  and it's just been getting worse. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=868.76s)]
*  And so what ends up happening to the people here is like I talked to people and they were like one [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=869.96s)]
*  woman, she was a nurse from California, worked her whole life, wanted to retire somewhere more [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=874.12s)]
*  affordable. The desert's beautiful, man. It's beautiful out there. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=878.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=882.52s)]
*  And so she and her husband get this like little like ranch, you know, small piece of property, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=883.08s)]
*  super modest, like double wide trailer. They drill a well and now they got water and they [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=887.96s)]
*  got their lives. They're going to retire there. They're going to, you know, the grandkids can [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=892.2s)]
*  come visit. Well, what happens is these big international farmers move in, they keep drilling [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=894.76s)]
*  deeper and deeper and pumping more and more water up. And pretty soon these families are going like, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=900.0400000000001s)]
*  dude, I can't pay half a million dollars to drill a well deep enough to find the water that's still [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=904.84s)]
*  there. And so they're at risk of losing like everything, like all their life savings that [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=910.0400000000001s)]
*  they put into their homes. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=915.4s)]
*  Right. Because now their land has been sold out kind of from under them really, or? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=916.84s)]
*  Their water has been sold out from under them. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=920.9200000000001s)]
*  But isn't there an agency that would protect the homeowners there? Isn't there some sort of? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=922.76s)]
*  No, I mean, the law is, is that if you, it's different in every region, but in this part [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=927.88s)]
*  of Arizona, if you buy a piece of land, you can pump out as much water as you want. Doesn't matter [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=934.52s)]
*  how it impacts your neighbor. Yeah. So like if you're, you know, a multi-billion dollar corporation, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=939.8s)]
*  you can go in there and buy up land, put in the deepest well and just suck out as much water as [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=945.72s)]
*  you want. And you know, the, the, the, the, the folks, the Pete living modestly around you, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=951.56s)]
*  their water goes away and that's just tough. You know, that's how the law is written. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=957.16s)]
*  Right. Yeah. It says right here, according to the United Nations, world water development report, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=961.48s)]
*  2024, 2.2 billion people will still lack access to safe drinking water and 3.5 billion will not [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=965.96s)]
*  have access to safe sanitation by 2024. But that's about drinking water, I think. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=972.36s)]
*  Cause drinking water is that the same as water for that you're talking about? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=980.36s)]
*  Well, like if you're pumping water to grow crops, you're eventually going to, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  you could have the potential of taking away somebody's drinking water. And that's what I [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=988.2s)]
*  see. Right. But like, when it turns to like quantity, like what we're actually using water [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=991.16s)]
*  for, like, you know, cause people will say this to me, like, Oh, Nestle bought up this aquifer. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=995.72s)]
*  They're going to bottle it. They're going to use it up. And I'm like, okay. But like, put in perspective [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=999.32s)]
*  one 10th of 1%, one 10th of 1% of the fresh water we use is for drinking 70 to 80% is for growing [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  crops. Right. And so when you're talking about somebody tapping an aquifer to bottle water, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1012.12s)]
*  like one 10th of 1% is how much we as humans drink. Right. Nothing. It's nothing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1017.96s)]
*  What we're pumping water out of aquifers for it, like huge, huge rates, huge amounts is to grow [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1023.64s)]
*  food. Right. Yeah. And so these are, and then like, and if, if you don't like, if it were just [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1030.2s)]
*  drinking water, that was an issue. There are ways to move around enough water to get everyone [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1035.4s)]
*  drinking water in theory. Right. But when you start talking about food, that's when you're talking [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1041.4s)]
*  about like what people really need to move water and they really need water for is for food. Yeah. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1047.24s)]
*  So drinking water, we can, we have enough water for that. Pretty much, man. I mean, like the vast [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1052.28s)]
*  amount of water, like you use as an individual is the food you put into your body and not the water [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1058.28s)]
*  that you drink. Got it. Like vast. Understood. Yeah. So, okay. So you start to connect some of [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1063.64s)]
*  these dots. You see the, um, the issue in Arizona from Saudi Arabia. Are there other things like [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1068.28s)]
*  that happening around America or is that just kind of a one-off? No, no, it's happening around [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1074.68s)]
*  America, right? Like it's going through this pretty big transitionary period where like, I think like, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1079.0s)]
*  and maybe, you know, you and I are roughly the same age. I think like a lot of people still kind [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1083.88s)]
*  of have this view of like farmers as like, you know, Willie Nelson's farm aid, right? Like small, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1087.16s)]
*  medium sized farmers, like, you know, both of them, you know, my, my family were all farmers in, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1094.52s)]
*  in Minnesota and Iowa. My dad grew up barefoot on a farm, right? Like we kind of envision it as like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1099.3200000000002s)]
*  these smaller farms. Um, but increasingly what they are, these really large farms, um, increasingly [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1104.36s)]
*  owned by like wall street pension funds or foreign governments or foreign corporations, right? Like [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1110.44s)]
*  that's been the trend line is that these smaller farmers, these medium medium sized farmers are [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1116.9199999999998s)]
*  getting bought out by bigger and bigger conglomerates. Um, and so like we're in this [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1122.6s)]
*  transitionary period in the U S is to like how food is getting made. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1127.64s)]
*  I see. And so not getting made by smaller farmers, but getting made in by larger corporations. Yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1132.92s)]
*  That could have other interests in that farm is just a passive or just a, um, placeholder. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1139.16s)]
*  That's it. It's a, it's a, you know, it's another profit mechanism because, you know, like if you're [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1145.0800000000002s)]
*  a country and you're like, we need to buy up food and water resources to make sure our people get [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1149.16s)]
*  fed and that they don't overthrow us. Right. And if you're, if you're wall street and you're [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1153.48s)]
*  looking at that, you're like, Oh, if there is a crunch on food in the future, food prices are [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1157.56s)]
*  going to go up. And if food prices go up, that's a profit margin. Right. And so like I've read these, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1162.3600000000001s)]
*  these reports put out by some of the biggest, you know, investment banks and they, you know, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1168.2s)]
*  they're just saying, you know, water is the new oil foods, the new gold of the 21st century. Like [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1172.28s)]
*  this is where things are going to happen. He says right here as the December 31st, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1177.56s)]
*  2022 foreign entities owned about 43.4 million acres of us agricultural land and forest, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1181.8s)]
*  which is about 3.4% of all agricultural land and almost 2% of all us farmland. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1187.72s)]
*  I wonder if it's grown since then. Well, there's two things about that is, um, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1192.52s)]
*  cause that doesn't seem like that much. No, it's a, it's a trend line. Um, but the other thing was, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1197.08s)]
*  as I pulled all of that data and the, when, when there's an old law in the books, it says, if you're [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1201.32s)]
*  a foreign company, you need to register. If you're going to buy us farmland, some states [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1208.28s)]
*  just ban it outright. But, um, the, the, I looked and I was like, I know that this farm is owned [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1213.8799999999999s)]
*  by a foreign corporation and it wasn't in the database. Yeah. And so like the government [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1220.92s)]
*  wasn't really following up and making sure. And so like, I have great, you know, those numbers to me [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1226.6s)]
*  come with a huge asterix, which is like, it requires them to report it. Not everyone's reporting [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1232.2s)]
*  and the government doesn't seem to be following up to make sure. Right. Understood. Yeah. And then [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1237.5600000000002s)]
*  the other thing is, is like, you have huge amounts of foreign wealth that are then put into [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1241.88s)]
*  intermediaries like black rock or something, right? Like these huge asset management, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1247.4s)]
*  what does black rock got $9 trillion that they manage. And so you'll have a sovereign wealth [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1252.52s)]
*  fund from another country that'll put money there. And then, so then black rock or some subsidiary [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1256.92s)]
*  of black rock or subsidiary of a subsidiary of black rock might own the land, but the financial [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1261.0800000000002s)]
*  backing is a foreign government. I see. So there's just like a lot of loopholes and like hidden LLCs, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1266.76s)]
*  that sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, how much of the land in America can be used and even on the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1273.4s)]
*  planet, if you know, it can be used to grow crops. Oh, that's interesting, man. I don't know [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1280.28s)]
*  how much of the land. I mean, like what you see in the Arizona desert, it's like it's desert, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1286.36s)]
*  but if you pump up the water, then you can grow alfalfa, right? And so it kind of comes down to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1290.6s)]
*  like, do you have the water there to do it? What we know is what they'll say is that like [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1294.6s)]
*  some huge percent 40 or 70%, I can't remember off the top of my head, some huge percent of the [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1300.6s)]
*  world's remaining available farmland is in Africa, right? And so that's why there's this huge push [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1305.08s)]
*  now for corporations to go down and to try to grab up land in Africa, because now they'll say, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1312.84s)]
*  oh, Africa is going to feed the world. Africa is going to feed the world, but I'm not saying no, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1319.72s)]
*  but I'm just, I remember 20 years ago when we were having to do, they had the, wasn't there the annual [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1326.04s)]
*  music every year to feed Africa? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and, and, and, and again, man, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1331.32s)]
*  the problem with that, that, that thing is, is like, so then I went to Africa. I was like, okay, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1338.2s)]
*  so where's all of this vacant land? And it wasn't vacant, man. People had ancestrally been living on [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1343.4s)]
*  that land and they'd been farming for their needs, you know, for their families, right? And what it [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1348.68s)]
*  happened was is these huge international corporations had come in and just moved people off. And so I [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1354.04s)]
*  was visiting these places where people were literally dying, having had their land taken from [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1359.5600000000002s)]
*  them by one of these international corporations that then could ship the food to a wealthier [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1365.0800000000002s)]
*  country, you know, whether that was Europe, China or Saudi Arabia, you know, they were literally had [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1370.28s)]
*  their land taken from them, had everything taken from them, right? And you saw it firsthand. I saw [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1377.4s)]
*  firsthand. Yeah. There's a really tough part in the documentary where there's a woman crying, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  really breaking down because of the fear of losing their land. She was really having a tough time [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1386.0400000000002s)]
*  with it. You know, that was pretty hard to watch. Yeah. I mean, that stuff's a downer and, and, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1393.0800000000002s)]
*  and what's, you know, and, and when I, when I showed the film to, to people there that are [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1398.1200000000001s)]
*  fighting back against this, what they didn't see is that it's part of this like giant international [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1403.72s)]
*  trend, right? Like it really is where you've got like, again, like intelligence communities, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1409.32s)]
*  governments, like all like kind of behind this big push in this big movement, right? And, and like [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1415.56s)]
*  you said, it's like when you're, when you don't have access to water because somebody upstream, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1422.28s)]
*  let's say is dam the river to grow food and now you don't even have drinking water. Oftentimes [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1427.64s)]

*  even more prevalent, you're saying? Yeah. And I think what, I think, you know, it does seem to be, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1606.6000000000001s)]
*  I talked to a bunch of African investigative journalists at this thing in DC and they saw the [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1613.72s)]
*  documentary and they came up in the afternoon like, dude, I've been seeing this in my country. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1618.36s)]
*  I didn't realize it was part of this like giant international trend, right? Like it's all sort of [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1622.12s)]
*  tied in. And that's how, that was like the same revelation that I had as I started digging in [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1628.1999999999998s)]
*  deeper and deeper was just how interconnected these things are, right? Cause like, you know. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1633.0s)]
*  When you say that, like, yeah, what do you mean when you say that? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1638.36s)]
*  I just mean like, I think the dude was from Sierra Leone and he was talking about a big rice farm [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1640.9199999999998s)]
*  that had come in and plowed down the forest and moved people off their land. And then they were [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1645.16s)]
*  exporting the rice to wherever, you know, a wealthier country. And he's like, you know, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1649.3200000000002s)]
*  how do I contextualize that? Like it's obviously an injustice, right? Like people have been, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1653.8000000000002s)]
*  their ancestral land has been taken from them, but like, where does that fit in? And then you see, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1659.64s)]
*  oh, it fits in that like people in Arizona are basically dealing with the same thing, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1663.4s)]
*  maybe not to the same degree, but all of a sudden they're finding what like was once theirs being [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1667.88s)]
*  taken by somebody else. I see, you know, and I think like, I think the, and so that's what I mean. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1672.12s)]
*  It's just like, there is this big little push and yes, I do think it's probably happening. And these [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1677.32s)]
*  kinds of numbers are super hard to get. And this is the only reason I hesitate anecdotally. I would [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1681.3999999999999s)]
*  say, yeah, it appears to be happening most prevalently in Africa. But like getting any [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1685.6399999999999s)]
*  good numbers on that, like nobody, the, you know, like they're not going out and nobody's going out [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1691.0s)]
*  and like documenting every single instance. So as a journalist, I always hesitate, right? So like in [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1695.8s)]
*  the document, you've seen it. We to like, just to give you a sense of what we go through, I took [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1701.16s)]
*  every single fact that's mentioned in that documentary and I put it into a spreadsheet [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1707.0800000000002s)]
*  and then me and a woman who's now a fact checker at the New Yorker, we went through every single [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1712.6000000000001s)]
*  fact that's in there and then we put three sources making sure it was true. And then we [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1716.44s)]
*  hired an outside fact checker to fact check our fact check, you know, like, like, and so like I [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1721.48s)]
*  always, and that's like, that's the value to me of good investigative journalism is like, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1726.52s)]
*  we're going to, we're going to put in that extra effort so that like everything is documented. And [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1730.76s)]
*  so, you know, I love this format because this is how, like, when I'm hanging out with friends, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1735.72s)]
*  this is how we talk, right? And they're like sharing knowledge and like, as humans, we sit [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1739.8s)]
*  around the campfire. This is all we've been telling stories and I love stories, you know, but I'm [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1743.8799999999999s)]
*  always like a little hesitant because I'm like, I don't got a fact checker behind me to whisper my [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1748.68s)]
*  ear. Like, oh, Nate, you screwed that fact up and she doesn't have a fact checker behind her to be [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1752.44s)]
*  like, oh no, you screwed up the fact check on the fact check, you know? Right. So we, yeah, you're [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1755.8s)]
*  just having to, yeah, you're just doing your best, you know, but you obviously spend a lot of time [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1759.56s)]
*  investigating it. And what, at what point do you start to go down a trail with investigative [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1763.96s)]
*  journalism where you're like, I've already gone too far. I have to fluff this thing up to at least [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1769.1599999999999s)]
*  make it hold the value of the weight that I've already put into with my time. Is that a weird [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1776.12s)]
*  question? Well, I think, or does that ever happen? You know, well, you made me laugh when he said [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1781.24s)]
*  fluff. Like, no. Do you ever get going on a story? Yes. And you abandon it. Yes. You're like, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1785.8s)]
*  there's this not enough here, even if you spend a long time. Yeah. What often happens, man, is, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1796.36s)]
*  is you'll be like, huh, I'm, this is what happens to me. I'm like, huh, I'm curious about that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1800.36s)]
*  Right. And then I'll start like digging into that. And that thing that I started digging into, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1805.8s)]
*  I'll be like, oh no, actually that makes sense. No, you know, like I don't think the world needs [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1809.8799999999999s)]
*  to know more about that. I don't think it's going to make anyone's lives better. I don't think it's [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1813.56s)]
*  going to change anyone's perception on how they interact with the world. But as I was doing that, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1816.52s)]
*  like I started seeing this other thing, right. And then, so then I start looking into that other [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1820.76s)]
*  thing and I'm like, well, that is pretty interesting. But in the process of looking into that, then I'm [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1825.08s)]
*  like, holy shit, look at that thing over there. And then I'm moving in and these things are, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1828.52s)]
*  are sometimes, you know, they could be totally unrelated. Oftentimes they're somewhat related. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1834.04s)]
*  And then it's that thing that I end up really going after. Right. And so I would never, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1838.2s)]
*  I don't want to waste my time. I don't want to waste your time. And I don't want to do an injustice [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1843.24s)]
*  to a story by being like, well, I spent time on looking into A and now I have to do something on [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1846.6s)]
*  A. Right. Cause oftentimes it's just a slowly shifts into B. And the next thing I know I'm like, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1850.68s)]
*  dude, I think people need to, would want to know about C, right? Like I think people should take a [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1855.32s)]
*  little break from their lives and lives are tough. Lives are complicated. We've all got so much going [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1860.12s)]
*  on. I want to like, you know, I want to honor people's time, but I'm like, but I think C is [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1863.8s)]
*  probably worth their time. Right. Yeah. What parts of this, as you went through this, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1867.48s)]
*  did it start to like, um, be like, okay, this is something that makes me realize I have to keep [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1871.8s)]
*  going here. Oh, I, you know, with this one, I think it was, it was kind of early on because again, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1877.0s)]
*  man, it's like when, when, you know, before this, I'd been doing organized crime and now I'm doing [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1883.8799999999999s)]
*  food and I was asked to do it. And I'm like, okay, it's a food story. You know, like, it's not going [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1888.9199999999998s)]
*  to blow my mind. It's like Papa John almost his story. Yeah, dude. I was just like, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1893.6399999999999s)]
*  but then all of a sudden I'm like, wait a minute, this, you're an intelligence officer for the CIA, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1897.8s)]
*  or you were, and you were like telling me X, Y, and Z, like, that's pretty interesting. Well, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1903.96s)]
*  let me go talk to somebody else to try to corroborate that or get like another hot take on it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1908.28s)]
*  You know, and it just kept building. And I'm like, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1913.08s)]
*  and then I started seeing the stakes, right? Like, but the number of people that it was [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1916.84s)]
*  going to impact. And we're talking about like billions, you know, like we're talking about, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1922.6s)]
*  you know, when you have wall street saying, this is going to be the biggest trajectory. When you [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1926.4399999999998s)]
*  have the world economic forum saying, this is one of the top five existential threats to our species, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1930.28s)]
*  you start going like food and water, you know, and you're like, this is probably worth my time [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1936.1999999999998s)]
*  and a lot of sleepless nights. At some point you just realized, I just think this is this story. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1941.9599999999998s)]
*  This is what, so can I tell you like when I, when we, so we made a film, right? And I, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1948.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm super lucky because I worked with this amazing director, Gabriella Coppethwaite, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1952.36s)]
*  you know, and she knows how to tell an amazing story. The grab, the documentary. Yeah. It's [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1956.28s)]
*  just like, she made this thing like an international ripper, right? And, and, but when we're going out [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1960.1999999999998s)]
*  and we're pitching it to the studios, they're all like, well, what do you want to come with this? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1965.08s)]
*  And I wanted, I wanted, what I wanted to happen when people see this documentary is the same thing [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1968.84s)]
*  that happened to me. When I started working on this stuff, it shifted my perception of how I see the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1973.56s)]
*  world. Like I fundamentally see the world differently now having worked on this story. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1979.08s)]
*  And so I wanted people to have access to that same information because I think when you begin to, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1983.24s)]
*  when you, when you see this, and I don't know if this was your experience or not, but when you see [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1987.8s)]
*  it, you're like, oh shit, like food isn't just food. Food has become like a weapon. Food has become [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1991.48s)]
*  like a power tool for, for governments to control people in other countries. Like it becomes way [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=1996.6s)]
*  bigger. Like how, yeah. How would we see that start to show up in our daily lives? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2002.52s)]
*  Food prices, right. Go to the grocery store. Right. I mean, do you remember during COVID when, when [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2008.6000000000001s)]
*  they were like, oh, everybody can stay at home except people that work in slaughterhouses. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2016.2s)]
*  We got to get everybody that works in slaughterhouses back. Cause we're really worried [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2020.44s)]
*  that there's not going to be meat on the shelves. Well, dude, as I recall during that time [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2024.04s)]
*  pork exports to China increased. So the executives of these big meat companies are like, oh, we got [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2030.6000000000001s)]
*  to get everybody back. We're worried about getting meat. And then they were shipping more meat to [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2037.4s)]
*  China. Well, it might've even been their, their farms. Well, yeah, they own, they own, you know, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2041.4s)]
*  this company that's in China. That was, you know, this deal that was backed by the Chinese [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2048.28s)]
*  government. Yeah. They, they control one in four American pigs. Wow. Yeah. Can you bring up that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2052.52s)]
*  article that we're talking about if you can on April 28, 2020, president Donald Trump issued an [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2057.0s)]
*  executive order invoking the defense production act to keep meat packing plants open. The executive [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2062.76s)]
*  order exempted plants from state and local orders to close non-essential businesses, but did not [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2068.76s)]
*  solve plants problems with sick workers. Wow. It's interesting. Yeah. I mean, it's just interesting [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2073.1600000000003s)]
*  because if people are going to need to eat, people are going to need meat. You're going to need people [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2078.44s)]
*  to be able to continue to eat or they're going to freak out. So even if they're stuck at home, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2085.88s)]
*  as long as they can get a burger, then they're going to, they're going to keep going until their [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2091.0s)]
*  next burger. You're right though. I mean, you're kind of like, put your finger on it, man. It's [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2096.7599999999998s)]
*  like, it is like food is that one thing that people want to keep going, right? Like the Chinese [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2101.3199999999997s)]
*  government, everybody. And that, you know, and that's kind of, that's what takes you to the Arab [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2107.7999999999997s)]
*  spring, right? Like when you saw all of these middle Eastern governments getting toppled, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2112.2799999999997s)]
*  right? Like the Arab spring, it was like, what do you mean the Arab spring? But Arab spring was [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2117.64s)]
*  like a little over 10 years ago now. And it was that period where you just saw civil wars breaking [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2122.7599999999998s)]
*  out across like North Africa and the middle East. And those things never happen. It's just like one [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2127.88s)]
*  single issue. They're like super complex. People don't like their leaders. They don't feel like they [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2134.68s)]
*  have hope, but increasingly the thing that the intelligence community is saying is driving those [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2138.84s)]
*  issues is food prices. You know, like you were talking about food prices here in the, where we [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2145.88s)]
*  were talking about food prices here in the grocery store, but like Americans, man, we only spend about [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2151.88s)]
*  7% of our income on food, on groceries, right? Other countries, do they spend like 50%? So whatever [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2157.08s)]
*  they're making, like half their paycheck is going to the food. And so when food prices go up for us, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2166.12s)]
*  it's only going up on like 7% of what we're spending on, right? So it's not hitting us [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2172.68s)]
*  overall as much. Exactly. Why do they spend so much on food? Because in, I mean, we're just a [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2177.24s)]
*  wealthy nation, you know? And so we have bigger income. Oh, I see. So we have larger income. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2183.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. So obviously, yeah, if you're making a hundred dollars a day, then that's just seven bucks a day, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2187.48s)]
*  where if you're making a hundred dollars, if you're making $10 a day, then $7 is 70% of your income. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2192.44s)]
*  And a lot of people, you know, like we're buying, we're buying food that's like finished, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2199.8s)]
*  we're buying processed food, we're buying things you can like open a package and eat. But a lot [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2204.52s)]
*  of people in these other countries, they're just buying like commodities like grain and they're [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2208.6800000000003s)]
*  baking their own bread. And so when those prices, like, you know, basically double, all of a sudden, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2212.36s)]
*  those people are seeing, you know, 50% of their income almost eat up their entire income and they [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2218.92s)]
*  can't feed themselves. They can't feed their kids. And I think that's what it comes down to, right? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2223.5600000000004s)]
*  So in the Arab Spring, there was a ton of that? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2228.04s)]
*  There was a ton of that. Food prices shot up, you know, they went to historic highs [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2229.8s)]
*  and that sustained and people started taking to the streets, right? Whole grievance issues, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2235.48s)]
*  but this was a big one. And you saw it move just across these countries. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2241.2400000000002s)]
*  And how was it alleviated? How did they, like, what kind of catharsis did they get into? Is [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2246.6s)]
*  catharsis the right word or no? A lot of them just took out their leaders. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2251.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Egypt overthrew their leaders, didn't they? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2256.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And so you just saw, yeah. So you saw like, and you saw [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2259.08s)]
*  this, and this is the thing about the 21st century is like, that was probably the first blip that we [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2266.2799999999997s)]
*  saw like that. And the forecast is for an increasing number of those. And when countries [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2272.7599999999998s)]
*  fall apart because of civil wars, oftentimes their people then migrate out, right? And then [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2277.9599999999996s)]
*  they put pressure on the countries around them because now they've got to feed more people [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2283.88s)]
*  because now you've got a failed nation next to you. And it became almost like a domino effect. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2287.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. And are the forecasts saying that there is going to be [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2291.88s)]
*  like less water, that there's going to be less food? Like where are we getting those forecasts from? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2296.92s)]
*  Yeah. So we could pull something up, but it's like, like 70% of the world's population or [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2301.88s)]
*  some number is going to be living in some form of water scarcity by like 2050. It's like a huge [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2308.92s)]
*  number, right? Of people that are dealing with water shortages. And again, like usually you can [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2316.2000000000003s)]
*  eke out enough water for your drinking water, but can you, do you have enough water to grow the foods [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2321.88s)]
*  you need to eat or for somebody else to grow the foods you need to eat? And so, and then the other [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2328.36s)]
*  thing we're looking at, it's like some places are going to have, you know, people are going to have [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2334.44s)]
*  droughts, of course, but then some places are going to have flood floods and too much water can have [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2339.56s)]
*  the same impact as not enough water, right? Like we just saw this in Pakistan where like their crop [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2344.2000000000003s)]
*  was wiped out by this, these massive floods that just kill off the crops. Yeah. I used to work on [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2348.84s)]
*  a soybean and corn and cotton farm for a couple of years and it was amazing how like water was [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2354.36s)]
*  just, I mean, you would stand around and talk about it. You would go look at a radar. You'd ask [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2361.08s)]
*  somebody if they'd seen any water. Like it was just crazy. It was unbelievable how that was the [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2366.52s)]
*  biggest thing. Yeah. That was the biggest thing. It was like, is it going to rain? Is it not? How [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2372.2s)]
*  are you going to manage your crops if it doesn't? And then how are you going to get subsidized by [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2376.84s)]
*  the government if it doesn't happen at all? Yeah, that's right. And what happens is in those, those [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2381.3199999999997s)]
*  countries that, that are dealing with all these economic hardships, these dictatorial leaders [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2386.2s)]
*  weren't subsidizing the farmers, right? And what's worse is they were given like their buddies [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2391.72s)]
*  access to whatever better, better. And so this is what you see in Syria. Are you saying in [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2396.6s)]
*  Venezuela, when you, you open the, and you see that the people who are going to maintain the, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2400.68s)]
*  the status quo of keeping starving people at bay are getting full groceries. Yes. That's crazy. How [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2406.52s)]
*  quick you will become the Gestapo in that moment, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Food becomes the ultimate [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2413.64s)]
*  currency. Yeah. What else were you going to say? I interrupted you. Well, I was going to say something [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2419.08s)]
*  similar in Syria where, you know, a drought hits Syria and you know, all of these farmers are losing [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2423.3199999999997s)]
*  their crops. People having to move into the cities, food prices are going up. And you know, rather [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2429.72s)]
*  than being like, okay, the government being like, okay, we need to make sure everyone's taken care [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2435.4s)]
*  of. From what I've read, I wasn't in Syria at the time, but it was like Bashir was just giving [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2438.52s)]
*  subsidies to like his buddies, you know? And then you just, you're building up this, this, this, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2443.96s)]
*  this, you're just building up a lot of anger. Yeah. And you can't feed your kids. It's like, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2448.84s)]
*  and this is what the, when I, when I talk to people that are in the intelligence community, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2453.24s)]
*  this is the thing they say. It's, it's not when this, and this sounds shitty, but this is what [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2457.0s)]
*  they say. It's not when the lowest income, the people that are the poorest can't eat that you see [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2461.64s)]
*  a country topple because unfortunately those people have already adjusted their mental [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2467.16s)]
*  mindset to just being shit on. Yeah. It's when the middle class can eat people that are used to [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2471.64s)]
*  being comfortable, right? And with Honda Accords. Yes. And then when they can't afford to eat and [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2479.64s)]
*  when they're, they're having to tell their kids, sorry, we can't eat today. We got to wait till [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2484.3599999999997s)]
*  tomorrow. Right. Those people take to the streets. Yeah. And then they overthrow governments, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2487.96s)]
*  you know, and sometimes the government turns out better and sometimes the government turns out [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2493.4s)]
*  worse and people live in violence and bloodshed for years, you know? So it's yeah. And this is [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2498.04s)]
*  kind of the trend line that, that we're seeing. And you believe it's an overall trend after all [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2504.6800000000003s)]
*  your research and all your digging, you believe that it's an overall trend that's going to continue. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2509.48s)]
*  It's totally, it's, I think personally, I think it's solvable. Okay. Right. I think it's solvable, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2513.56s)]
*  but it is, it is the trend line that we are on that, that like, if we don't get into another [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2518.52s)]
*  lane of traffic, this is the direction that this road is heading. Got it. And this is straight up [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2525.32s)]
*  from like the, the, the, the U S government, I keep saying intelligence community, right? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2529.64s)]
*  But there is the ODNI, the office of director of national intelligence that oversees the CIA, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2535.88s)]
*  the DIA, the Nick, all of these intelligence agencies. And the highest level work product [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2541.48s)]
*  they do is something called a national intelligence estimate. And they did a national [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2546.7599999999998s)]
*  intelligence estimate on, on water in the year 2012. So basically they came out and the guy who [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2550.8399999999997s)]
*  was spearheading, and this is like the highest level work product, the intelligence, U S [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2558.44s)]
*  intelligence community does said business as usual, you know, is going to be a catastrophe. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2561.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. Like, and that was their prediction. Basically. Yeah. And, and they, they lay out [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2567.24s)]
*  solutions like we can move things, right? But it, you know, it has, that's going to have to [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2571.4s)]
*  happen on an international level. And like, we look at our domestic politics and we're like, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2576.28s)]
*  there's a mess. You look at international politics and you're like, there's a real mess. So, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2581.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, we all, you're going to keep doing what we can and we all get, you know, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2586.36s)]
*  keep living. But like, but still this is, I mean, having foresight is, is super important, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2590.2000000000003s)]
*  especially in a time where it's like, we don't even, there's so much artificial site that you [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2595.8s)]
*  don't know what is foresight anymore. You know, there's so much manipulation. You just, it's so [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2602.52s)]
*  hard to know what's real on March 22nd, 2012, the national intelligence council, which you're [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2608.04s)]
*  saying is a conglomerate of all of those. The Nick exists underneath the ODNI. Okay. Yeah. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2612.36s)]
*  The ODNI, but yeah. Release the unclassified report, the intelligence community assessment [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2619.0800000000004s)]
*  on global water security. The report concludes that several regions of the world, such as North [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2623.8s)]
*  Africa, the middle East and South Asia will face major challenges coping with water problems. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2627.4s)]
*  And that during the next 10 years, many countries important to the United States will experience [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2631.88s)]
*  water problems that will increase the risk of instability and state failure, exacerbate [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2635.88s)]
*  regional tensions and distract them from working with the United States on important policy [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2640.2000000000003s)]
*  objectives. Yeah. I guess if the, how you barter and trade and deal with things is going to become [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2645.2400000000002s)]
*  a lot different. Yeah. Wow. You mentioned Africa and you guys go into a lot in the doc. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2650.52s)]
*  Why, why is Africa always gets screwed? I mean, since the beginning of time, whether it's the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2659.16s)]
*  British coming in or a foreign entity coming in and enslaving or claiming, whether it's them [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2666.44s)]
*  enslaving each other, whether it's the tribes that just can't get along, whether it's a government [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2672.52s)]
*  that starts up and then, um, sells out, like, why do they have so much trauma there? Yeah, man, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2676.92s)]
*  it's a good question. And, you know, I always try to operate from like a, uh, a place of historically [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2685.08s)]
*  informed journalism, right? Because some of these trend lines are massive. And, you know, what we [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2690.44s)]
*  saw was that Western Europe for some centuries just had this intense power as they sort of [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2695.0s)]
*  globalized the world and Africa had a lot of resources that they wanted. Um, and they went [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2701.24s)]
*  in there and they grabbed them and they created artificial boundaries and borders around, um, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2707.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, that, that, that suited Western Europe, like Africa got carved up into territories that [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2712.52s)]
*  suited Western Europe and their treaties so that they wouldn't fight with each other in Europe, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2718.68s)]
*  right? And, and that wasn't always the, the boundaries that of like the, of the governments [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2722.92s)]
*  and the nations that had lived there. Um, and you know, that, and you go back even farther than [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2727.88s)]
*  when Western Europe was sort of the, the, the international dominant player, right? Like you [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2732.84s)]
*  look at Genghis Khan, right? Genghis Khan, born in the central steeps of Asia, the dude became a [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2738.44s)]
*  slave, then went from being a slave to controlling like the entire Mongolian empire. Then they went [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2744.84s)]
*  into China and they took over China. Then he pushes East and starts taking over Eastern Europe. And [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2751.7200000000003s)]
*  then he drives down into Southern Asia, you know, the Middle East dude controlled the largest [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2756.36s)]
*  empire of any human in history. Right. And when he, this is the thing, and I'm getting a lot of [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2761.88s)]
*  this. Yeah, totally. Denver nuggets. It's like the kind of in one person, but go on. Sorry. Yeah. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2766.92s)]
*  And he gets to Europe at that time. And I'm getting this from this, this guy, Jack Weatherford's book, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2774.28s)]
*  Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world. He's a historian in Minnesota somewhere. One of [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2779.48s)]
*  those, one of those colleges. And when Genghis Khan gets to, to, to Europe, he's looking around. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2784.12s)]
*  He's like, these people are too dumb and too poor for me to bother conquering. You know, like they [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2790.6s)]
*  didn't even have pants at that point. Like pants, like pants are an Asian invention, right? Like [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2796.12s)]
*  pants came from Asia at that time in Europe. People are just wearing cloaks. Like they didn't [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2802.3599999999997s)]
*  even have pants yet. They didn't, you know, that gunpowder came from China, movable type from China. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2806.2799999999997s)]
*  And so Genghis Khan gets to Europe and he's like, these people are too dumb, too poor and too [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2810.84s)]
*  ignorant. And he just drove South into the middle East where people were doing like algebra and [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2814.2000000000003s)]
*  advanced math and like had all of this technology. Right. And then that set up these trading routes. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2818.44s)]
*  And those trading routes connected some of these great advanced technologies from the middle East [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2824.2000000000003s)]
*  and from Asia. And they started working their way into Europe. And then boom, Europe has the [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2829.48s)]
*  Renaissance and boom, the Renaissance blows up into the industrial revolution. And then that [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2834.0400000000004s)]
*  industrial revolution. Now you have like the Pope carving up the entire world between Spain and [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2839.32s)]
*  Portugal. Like Portugal gets one half, Spain gets the other half, and then they're going down and [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2844.6000000000004s)]
*  they're carving up Africa. Right. And then you just, you get to where we are today, which is that, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2849.48s)]
*  you know, Africa never had a strong say in how they were and what went on in the last few, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2856.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, centuries. What things did you notice when you started to explore some of the stuff [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2863.2400000000002s)]
*  happening in Africa? Well, issues in what sense? Like, I guess like the ownership, like who was [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2866.92s)]
*  doing the, like you say, land getting bought up that had ancestral value, of course. Yeah. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2873.64s)]
*  Who was doing that? Like who was, is it hard to know who was doing it? Well, oftentimes it's really [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2879.16s)]
*  hard to trace back who's doing it because you can be like this rush. It can just be these layers of [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2884.6s)]
*  LLCs and who ultimately is behind this LLC can be really tough. Like I can go there and be like, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2890.36s)]
*  okay, so this is the white South African dude or white Zimbabwean dude who now is in like Zambia [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2896.44s)]
*  and he's, you know, moved people off their historic ancestral land and he's doing this like super [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2903.0s)]
*  modern farming. Right. And, and these other people that had been there for the families have been [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2908.04s)]
*  there for centuries are now like dying, right? Cause they don't have access to even enough [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2913.0s)]
*  drinking water, much less enough water to grow food. Right. Um, and I can, I can be, I can see [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2916.6s)]
*  that, but like, then I look at the property ownership and it's just a jumble of LLCs and [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2922.12s)]
*  that can be pretty tough. Um, but you know, in the film, one of the things we were able, we got this [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2926.68s)]
*  like trove of information documents. I mean, we see that in some cases it's the leaders of foreign [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2931.3199999999997s)]
*  governments that are paying essentially mercenaries to go in and gobble up these resources. Right. And, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2938.2s)]
*  and one of the ways they do it, you know, and these, these emails that we get, we see they just talk [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2946.2s)]
*  about giving gifts to the chief. Right. And, and, and, you know, essentially bribes, right. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2951.4s)]
*  It's how I'd interpret that. And what is a mercenary just so everybody knows? Well, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2957.56s)]
*  a mercenary is effectively somebody who can provide military logistics on behalf of another government. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2961.0s)]
*  Okay. So like, how would I use a mercenary? Well, you could use a mercenary to go into, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2969.64s)]
*  are they good guys or bad guys? Or they can be, this is interesting. You brought up Rwanda just [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2977.0s)]
*  a minute ago and I'm trying to remember the name of the actress that was going to hire a [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2980.92s)]
*  mercenary outfit to go in. Like when no one on the international level was stopping the Rwandan [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2986.52s)]
*  genocide, this, this Hollywood actress wanted to hire a mercenary group to try to go in and stop it. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2991.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. Like, so like she was using it potentially like she thought of using it as this force of good. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=2997.32s)]
*  But so there, there, there are these examples of people wanting to use these types of groups to [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3003.4s)]
*  like quell violence, to bring stability, right. To, to move food into, into areas that are [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3007.4s)]
*  being controlled by warlords, right. Like, so you can, you know, sometimes people make an argument [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3014.76s)]
*  that you need to meet force with force to do good, right. And then you also see them being used by [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3019.48s)]
*  corporations to make deals with warlords, you know, to extract resources. And those tend to have a [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3024.84s)]
*  more deleterious or, you know, fucking create, make life shittier for the people who live there. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3031.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you see some of that? Like, what were some of the things that you saw, like people struggling [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3036.28s)]
*  with, Oh dude, just feeding themselves, having shelter, you know, like super basic stuff, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3039.96s)]
*  super basic stuff. And it sucks. It sucks to see that stuff. I don't want to see that stuff, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3046.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, and then I got to carry it home, you know, and then, and, and, you know, it's like, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3050.28s)]
*  it's that thing they always say, like, you, you see these people who have done nothing wrong, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3054.2000000000003s)]
*  or just like struggling to survive. Yeah. You know, and I go in there as essentially like a [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3059.2400000000002s)]
*  storyteller and I'm like, you know, and they're like, dude, like we need food, we need water. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3064.28s)]
*  And you're like, Oh, you know, like, what can I, what can I do? That's not my role. My role is to [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3069.1600000000003s)]
*  tell people about what's happening to you. And then I fly back to San Francisco and I turn on [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3073.4s)]
*  the faucet and I can drink fresh water, you know, and you're like, you know, so these are the, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3078.2000000000003s)]
*  these are, this is, these are some of the challenges of going in and anyways, I went off a [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3082.44s)]
*  little bit, but like, yeah, I've seen this shit, you know, and like there's, you know, there are [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3088.44s)]
*  stories I've heard and there are things that I've seen that, you know, like I, I wish, you know, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3093.56s)]
*  which didn't happen to people. And then I wish that I didn't have to experience firsthand, you know, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3098.04s)]
*  do you feel like we're doing the same thing in other countries though? The U S government or like [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3102.2799999999997s)]
*  us corporations. Yeah. Like, are we doing the same thing that's happening here and other places? For [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3106.04s)]
*  sure. For sure. Yeah. So was it all just even out? Well, no, I mean, I would say that it, if you're [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3110.2s)]
*  like, if, if, if you're looking at it, like, oh, China's a bad guy or the Saudis are the bad guys, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3119.56s)]
*  but you know, the U S is, is, is okay. It evens out in that sense, right? Like we have massive [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3124.2s)]
*  corporations that are going in and are contributing, I think, to this pattern of people who are living [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3129.4s)]
*  on land, losing their land or people whose water supplies are being taken from them. Right. And, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3135.64s)]
*  and it's destabilizing the world is like the short of it. And then you end up with it, a stabilized [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3139.88s)]
*  world and you end up with like mass migration and you end up with countries being like, we don't want [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3144.12s)]
*  any more immigrants, you know, and you're like, yeah, but they left because they were hungry. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3149.08s)]
*  And like, why were they hungry? Like what was happening to them? Right. Right. And so you, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3153.3199999999997s)]
*  right. You're not getting just immigrants. You're getting starving in some cases, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3157.72s)]
*  increasingly. That is the case. Like they're at one point, the state department said the reason, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3160.92s)]
*  you know, the, the number one reason people were leaving Guatemala was because they were hungry. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3165.48s)]
*  And think about Guatemala, man, like think about that region of the world. What have they given us? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3169.3199999999997s)]
*  Avocados, chocolate. I think tomatoes come from that region. Right. Yeah. Like it, it, it, it, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3174.2s)]
*  um, like I think, oh, when you go under the stick or whatever, under the limbada or whatever, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3179.64s)]
*  I don't know that the limbo limbo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like those countries have given us [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3185.3999999999996s)]
*  so much food. Like, how is it possible that a country that is the source of so many, like you [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3191.48s)]
*  think of tomatoes, you're like, Oh, Italians must've invented it. Right. You're like, no, man, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3196.8399999999997s)]
*  that came from the Americas. Potatoes came from the Americas. Chocolate came from the Americas. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3199.72s)]
*  Avocados came from the Americas. Right. And how do you have now a region like that where [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3204.2799999999997s)]
*  half of the children are stunted because they're not getting enough calories and nutrition. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3209.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. And so like people are leaving Guatemala because there's not enough food. And that's crazy [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3215.08s)]
*  because this place is growing plenty of food. So what's happening to the food is just being [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3220.4399999999996s)]
*  exported to wealthier countries. So do you think that we're like some of the reason [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3224.52s)]
*  for China's low water supply is because of us? No, I don't think that's the case with China. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3229.64s)]
*  I think China is a really interesting example, right? Like we manufacture a ton over there. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3234.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Totally. No. China is an interesting case, right, man, because [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3239.56s)]
*  this is like, I don't think this is well enough known, but one of the greatest achievements, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3245.56s)]
*  in my opinion, of the 20th century was what China accomplished. And that was pulling 400 million [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3249.3199999999997s)]
*  people out of poverty in like three decades. Right. Like you'll hear people talking about all [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3257.24s)]
*  of the great achievements of our species, you know, over the last, you know, whatever, 50 years. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3263.4799999999996s)]

*  don't realize this, but the Nazis had what they called the hunger plan. And by controlling Ukraine, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3390.1200000000003s)]
*  they intended according to these little known documents that historians of honor earth, you [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3396.2s)]
*  know, from the Nazis, they intended to starve 30 million people to death by controlling Ukraine. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3400.7599999999998s)]

*  like fundamentally when, when the landscape is shifting in front of us and like the most powerful [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3713.32s)]
*  people are shifting with that landscape, I come a big advocate of the everyday guy. Yeah. And I'm [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3720.04s)]
*  like, dude, we got to empower ourselves with that same information. You know, we have to know how [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3724.92s)]
*  this thing is shifting, right? Because otherwise those people in Arizona, they just see this big [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3730.12s)]
*  farm come in and they're like, well, okay. What they don't know is that it gets part of this big [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3734.2000000000003s)]

*  change your tune. Yeah. And America's, I don't know if you'll do it as a country, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3761.16s)]
*  but you, as an individual, you won't have a choice, but to do it. Right. I think for, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3765.56s)]
*  for some people, yeah. I mean, food prices will probably continue to climb. Right. And people are [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3770.12s)]
*  going to have to make like real lifestyle decisions based on that. Um, you know, we'll probably see [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3774.9199999999996s)]
*  food potentially becoming a bigger and bigger percentage of our like take-home incomes. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3781.08s)]

*  you know, I think, I just think it, it information is power. Yeah. And what I'll tell you is that the [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3790.92s)]
*  most powerful have access to better information today. I think that the disparity of information [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3795.24s)]
*  between the powerful and the everyday person has just grown. Like we always talk about income [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3801.88s)]
*  disparity and it's a real thing. Totally. I get it. But information disparity, man, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3806.36s)]
*  it might even be worse. A hundred percent, even just to go to accredited news sources online, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3810.52s)]
*  not to get information, you have to pay for it. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Even to get what used to be [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3816.44s)]
*  just a newspaper, right? Yeah. You have to pay for that information. So whether you even believe it, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3820.84s)]
*  it's going to be true or not to have information that's even kind of sourced, you know, that's [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3826.1200000000003s)]
*  put together, that's formatted. That's not done by AI. You're having to pay for that. Yeah. And [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3830.92s)]
*  I hope that we get back to more of that, man, because that's how it used to be when we were [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3837.2400000000002s)]
*  kids, right? Like you pay of a newspaper subscription. Um, right. I think people [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3839.96s)]
*  decided they couldn't trust the news anymore. I think a lot of that has occurred in the past [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3845.0s)]
*  10 years for sure. I think I feel like the news, every time I turn it on, I feel like it is, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3849.96s)]
*  there's some lobbyists behind it. There's some, um, you know, I mean, people say big farm all [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3856.6s)]
*  the time, but we have so many drug ads on our television. It's like, you know, it just feel, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3862.2s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if it's compromised. That's what it feels like. I then news industries in a [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3867.3199999999997s)]
*  tailspin and I'll give you my two cents for what it's worth. Cause I've been a journalist now for [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3873.24s)]
*  like 25 years, some insane amount of time. I can't believe that. Um, but when I started, um, as a [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3876.6s)]
*  daily newspaper reporter, like we had a nice big staff, man. Like we had, we had librarians on [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3883.16s)]
*  staff. We had researchers on staff. You know, we had photographers, a sports desk, a business desk, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3888.52s)]
*  you know, and, um, and I think, I don't know, man, was it like, there's like a third as many [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3893.8799999999997s)]
*  journalists as there used to be, right? Like if there's fewer people doing anything, it's going [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3898.7599999999998s)]
*  to be a shittier job. You're going to get a crappier product, right? And so, and, and, and, and [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3903.96s)]
*  the trend line that, that gutted journalism wasn't initially that, cause I totally agree. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3908.92s)]
*  I'll the stats say what you're saying. People don't trust the news like they used to, but it [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3914.12s)]
*  wasn't in the trend line. Wasn't that people stopped subscribing. What happened was, is that [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3917.7200000000003s)]
*  newspapers used to make huge profits from things like classified ads, right? Like you, you know, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3921.88s)]
*  we used to read the classified ads in the back, right? Like you could meet a woman or even get a [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3926.6800000000003s)]
*  adopt a pet, get a new BMX bike or like a dirt bike, like a new car, like it was all back there. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3930.28s)]
*  And that stuff, man, that subsidized the journalists. And so of course that went away [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3936.2s)]
*  and that was like a lion's share of the profits, right? Craigslist kind of killed that. And it's [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3940.68s)]
*  fine. A technology is going to do and like the newspapers didn't, they didn't react in time. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3945.4s)]
*  You know, they lost this big thing. And so like, you just started seeing the industry shrinking [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3950.6s)]
*  and shrinking and now the layoffs in the last two years have just been like brutal. But the, the, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3955.08s)]
*  problem there is, man, it's like, I could quit journalism and I could go become a private [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3960.2s)]
*  researcher doing the exact same thing I'm doing now as an investigative journalist. But instead [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3965.0s)]
*  of giving it to the public, I would be giving it to hedge funds. I'd be giving it to super wealthy [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3968.92s)]
*  people that would literally, I'm not shitting. You would pay me four to five times what I'm getting [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3973.64s)]
*  paid now. Right. And, and, and that's actually what's happening. Right. And so like you, you, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3978.04s)]
*  you have the public who is increasingly just getting not as good, much information, especially [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3982.92s)]
*  if you're in like a local news market, right? Like you're not getting information. People aren't [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3988.44s)]
*  paying for it. There are fewer journalists and then the wealthiest are paying for it still. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3992.52s)]
*  And they're getting incredibly in-depth information. Right. And now you're starting to see [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=3997.8s)]
*  privatized spaces have the journalists almost on their side, working for them to give them [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4002.52s)]
*  information that better helps them to market to the everyday person. Yeah. And I wouldn't say call [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4009.64s)]
*  that person a journalist, but that, that same like deep researcher investigative project, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4016.44s)]
*  especially in tech man. Well, I think it's like, you know, they had, even if you look at the case [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4021.96s)]
*  of the opioid epidemic, right. And that there was a documentary, there was a television show. I can't [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4027.32s)]
*  remember the name of it. All the beauty in the bloodshed was a doc that came out that looked [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4033.2400000000002s)]
*  super deep at the opioid or I can't remember. Alex Gibney, maybe on HBO looked at the opioid [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4037.56s)]
*  epidemic too. This one had Michael Keaton. Okay. You know, is that a real person? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4042.36s)]
*  I mean, I don't know Hollywood, so I don't know actors and I don't know the space as well, but [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4047.6400000000003s)]
*  yeah. Yeah. They had this, there you go. Dope sick. They had this, this series came out. It's unbelievable. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4050.6000000000004s)]
*  It's how, um, it's how the opioid companies pay, like basically hired people that had been working [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4055.5600000000004s)]
*  on the food and drug administration to come and work for them so they could work the loopholes. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4065.2400000000002s)]
*  Totally. And then I'll, I mean, I'll just tell you my two cents. The reason that we often know [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4071.08s)]
*  stories like this, like how FDA former employees were then going is because a journalist went in [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4075.3199999999997s)]
*  and dug it out and published it. Right? Like these types of fictionalized versions get written off [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4081.56s)]
*  of like hard work of investigative journalists. And there are fewer and fewer people pulling out [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4086.2799999999997s)]
*  stories like this. And I'll tell you, man, as a journalist, like my problem 20 years ago was that [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4090.9199999999996s)]
*  I was always worried that some other journalist was going to scoop the story and get it before me. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4096.68s)]
*  Today, my problem is that people are coming to me with important stories and I don't have the time [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4101.16s)]
*  to work on them because I'm already working on something and I don't even have another journalist [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4107.8s)]
*  I can tell them to go to. Right? Like we're just not getting out as many important stories like that [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4111.400000000001s)]
*  as we used to, because there's just fewer of us like, and, and, and, and there are more people [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4116.360000000001s)]
*  working for the lobbyists. There are more people working for the PR firms that are spinning stuff. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4120.92s)]
*  And so this is, we're getting into this really imbalanced place of information and [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4124.84s)]
*  dark time. And that's why conspiracy theories rise. I totally agree because it's like, well, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4129.8s)]
*  people are going by their gut. People are looking to fill a void and people want some truth. I think [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4134.4400000000005s)]
*  if you don't have truth, you can feel it. Yeah, I think so. And I always say, and this is the other [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4139.96s)]
*  thing, man, is for me, journalism, it's okay. So like take a football, right? Like the surface of [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4145.88s)]
*  a football is imperfect, right? It's why a quarterback spirals the ball. Because if you, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4151.16s)]
*  if you throw the football without spiraling it, because the surface of the football is fancy. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4157.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's like imperfect. It just flops around. Yeah. And, and, and, and, but you spiral [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4161.72s)]
*  it and all of those imperfections get smoothed out. And journalism is the same way. Like no [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4166.04s)]
*  journalist is the voice of God. But when you've got 10 journalists covering the same thing, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4171.24s)]
*  you're going to get as close to the, to the obtainable version of the truth as possible [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4176.04s)]
*  because you have 10 different people that are competing to get it out. They're going to, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4180.68s)]
*  they're going to check each other. They're going to, they're going to point out if somebody else, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4184.280000000001s)]
*  you know, misses something or screw something up and you get it the closest possible obtainable [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4187.08s)]
*  version of the truth. Now when you just have one person, it's like a football that's not spiraling [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4191.64s)]
*  anymore. It just gets totally off kilter. And I think we're getting closer to that. And, and I [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4196.280000000001s)]
*  think that's like in a democracy when we're supposed to be an informed group of people that [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4201.56s)]
*  are going to go to the ballot box and vote, you know, it's a problem. If we were in China, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4205.88s)]
*  it wouldn't matter because the government's going to tell us what to do anyway. But in a country [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4209.64s)]
*  where we're like, no, no, we need to be informed so we can go to vote. That becomes a problem. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4213.160000000001s)]
*  How does that end for us? Was that football analogy, the dumbest analogy you've ever heard? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4217.240000000001s)]
*  It just kind of came to me. No, I thought it was pretty good. Okay, cool. Yeah. But I'm also [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4221.400000000001s)]
*  dumb a lot of times. So it's like, I wouldn't have asked me, but I thought it worked for me. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4226.52s)]
*  All right, cool. I'm easily, I'm easily susceptible to just whatever, but, but yeah, I wonder what does [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4231.72s)]
*  that look like for us? If we, when you get to a place where you don't trust, I wonder if it's that [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4239.0s)]
*  we don't trust authority now, but I never trusted authority, right? I never trusted authority either. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4245.08s)]
*  Yeah. But I always thought there was this level of integrity, maybe in the distance that I, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4250.04s)]
*  maybe I thought I'm it's so hard for me to figure out what I feel like is missing these days. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4256.44s)]
*  I feel like as individuals, a lot of us are missing purpose and our purpose is being farmed [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4261.56s)]
*  out to technology and to big corporations instead of things that are meaningful. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4267.88s)]
*  I think we're losing community. Yes. And then that's going to happen too. You have no purpose. You [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4274.52s)]
*  don't have a local newspaper. You don't have like a local place where everybody can even go meet up. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4278.2s)]
*  People aren't going to church. So there's the, at that point, you're just a lot of strangers living [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4282.92s)]
*  near each other. I think that's it, man. I think that's a huge problem in this country. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4287.72s)]
*  And how does that change? I wonder, you know, like, what does the future of that look like? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4291.32s)]
*  Do we just turn into like these lemmings just waiting for the next cheeseburger? Like, you know, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4296.04s)]
*  I, you know, I've done some investigative reporting on big tech and that's a space, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4303.0s)]
*  you know, like that, you know, like, man, my reporting has shown me like things that just [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4308.68s)]
*  like as a human, as a person concern me, you know, like it's like really cool because they're, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4313.8s)]
*  they become these beautiful, creative spaces, right? And, and, and like, as people that are [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4320.12s)]
*  artistic and like to share their stories, people get on there and they can connect with communities [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4325.16s)]
*  and there's all these great things that happen. But I increasingly see those spaces as a hunting [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4329.64s)]
*  ground for big tech companies to target specific people and take them down. And I'll give you one [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4335.24s)]
*  of the examples I'm talking about is that I did this investigative prod where I got this [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4340.68s)]
*  investigation, um, where I got internal emails from inside of Facebook and I got, you know, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4346.44s)]
*  documents from inside of this company that was like a social casino company. It was essentially [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4351.72s)]
*  like you could play games on your phone that looked like a slot machine and you would never [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4356.92s)]
*  win any money. Like you just got to understand it. You would never win any money back. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4363.320000000001s)]
*  And if you used up all your coins that they get in the day for free, you would then have to buy [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4368.04s)]
*  more coins. Something like 99% of people never pay for coins. It's like 1%. And then it's something [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4373.88s)]
*  like 1 10th of 1% drive like 97% of the revenue at that company. And those companies that again, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4381.56s)]
*  you can never win your money back. We're now generating more revenue than the Las Vegas strip, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4389.400000000001s)]
*  billions and billions of dollars. So who were the people that were spending money? Well, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4395.0s)]
*  I found one of those women. She was living outside of Dallas. She was living modest middle income. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4398.84s)]
*  She spent $400,000 buying virtual coins that she could never win back. So who does that? Right? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4404.84s)]
*  Well, it turns out that a certain slice of people, very small slight have a type of brain that can [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4415.72s)]
*  get super fixated on this. Like they, they compulsively can't stop. And the technology [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4422.68s)]
*  companies divide devised algorithms. They use artificial intelligence where the CEO of one of [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4429.56s)]
*  these companies said the first time somebody opens that app and starts playing, they can identify [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4435.160000000001s)]
*  them from all of the little habits and immediately mark them as what they would call a VIP or a whale. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4440.280000000001s)]
*  Right. And they would put them down this path where they would actually get a special representative, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4447.080000000001s)]
*  an actual human who would call them this woman outside of Texas who lost 400,000 when her mom [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4452.280000000001s)]
*  died. They sent flowers to her mom's funeral, right? Like they immediately identify that you [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4456.84s)]
*  have this type of brain that's going to keep spending money that you can't, you can't afford [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4461.72s)]
*  and be your, you'll never get back. And they just target you and they push you and they pull as [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4466.92s)]
*  much money out of you as they can. And that's, that's what I see, man. I see this, like, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4472.2s)]
*  I see now like people are spending their time on there, but people are watching you spend your time [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4476.84s)]
*  and they're building your behavior and they're looking for your weakness. And as soon as they [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4482.2s)]
*  can exploit your weakness, man, they are going to grab everything they can. Wow. It's really the, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4486.599999999999s)]
*  it's the devil. It's what you would think of as the devil using yourself against you even. I mean, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4492.28s)]
*  that looked at what if your own shadow could fucking take your pocket? What would your life be like? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4497.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like, I mean, maybe that's a crazy thing. That's almost as bad as [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4502.36s)]
*  your football thing, but, but no bro, it's the, it's the dark arts. It's like the algorithm [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4506.04s)]
*  learning you and learning you and learning you, massaging you and all that matters. But is it, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4514.92s)]
*  is it for profit or is it for control? I don't understand. I'm guessing it's probably both. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4520.92s)]
*  I just don't understand how that behooves anybody. Like who closes their eyes at night and was like, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4526.36s)]
*  yeah. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4533.719999999999s)]
*  Dude, those companies that I just talked about went from nothing in like 2009 to 2010 to being [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4534.44s)]
*  billion dollar companies. And they were owned by a few dudes who started them up. Like it behooved [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4539.88s)]
*  those dudes. Those dudes are killing it. I found one of the women who worked at one of these companies [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4544.92s)]
*  who was pushing this woman outside of Dallas to spend all of this money. Right. And I got on her [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4550.92s)]
*  Instagram, that girl was just flying around the world, living it up Egypt. Oh, look how cool. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4556.679999999999s)]
*  I am now. Oh, look at me and I'm photos in front of the Sphinx. Now I'm in Italy eating in [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4562.28s)]
*  Tuscany, right? Right. Living this life. And in the meantime, she's just encouraging people to lose [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4567.96s)]
*  their money. Wow. And can we name these people or is it kind of private information? Well, I can, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4573.0s)]
*  you know, I, I mean, the store, my, I wrote my story. Susie Kelly is the woman outside of Dallas. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4577.88s)]
*  Let's see product madness. Is that the name of the company that was, uh, we're targeting? I want to [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4583.4s)]
*  pull up the story to make sure I was getting this right because this is the challenge I have as an [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4590.04s)]
*  investigative journalist. I misspeak just a little bit. I can get sued. Yeah, for sure. We can get [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4594.28s)]
*  sued as well. And so I always want to be accurate. Right. And so, you know, we can pull up the story [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4600.36s)]
*  and cause I did this story. Now, what was that six, seven years ago? Um, these are companies [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4604.76s)]
*  where you can't win really. You can't win your money back. But you, people have like figured out [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4610.84s)]
*  that there's a type of person with a behavior, um, that can, that it's basically definitely a [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4616.92s)]
*  definitive victim right here. It says social casinos now use behavioral analysis software to [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4624.84s)]
*  quickly identify people who are likely to become big spenders behaviors like increasing your bet [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4629.24s)]
*  or playing frequently our signals to the companies. And they target these players with heavy marketing [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4633.4800000000005s)]
*  and label them proto whales as Broton's explained or room full of game developers back in 2015. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4637.56s)]
*  If I remember correctly, that guy, Jose Broton was like a Stanford graduate, you know, uh, in like [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4644.5199999999995s)]
*  computer science or something, took that knowledge, you know, they pair it up with, uh, like essentially [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4649.799999999999s)]
*  like behavioral scientists, psychologists, and then they just start getting better and better [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4655.48s)]
*  at focusing on these people who they can extract from. Yeah, man. It's like you're up against it. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4661.08s)]
*  And sometimes though, there's a part of people that go to gamble like that. There's a part of them that [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4667.16s)]
*  wants to, sometimes I think that there's a part of us [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4671.48s)]
*  when I'm amazed that we don't stand up sometimes as a population, right? I don't think we always know [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4679.799999999999s)]
*  that's the problem, man. I don't think we have the information to know this story. Like how many, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4684.12s)]
*  like that to me, that story is mind blowing that that's going on. Right. Cause yeah, how many people [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4688.919999999999s)]
*  are gambling on their phone or looking at playing solitaire and then it turns into a finite. Yeah. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4693.16s)]
*  Right. Um, or, or, or how many of us are just aware in which like the patterns of ads that we see are [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4696.84s)]
*  like, Oh, because they have your behavioral profile, right? Like you're getting a pattern this way, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4703.24s)]
*  or your newsfeed looks this way, or you're getting content this way. Um, and how is that affecting [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4708.52s)]
*  you? Right. Like how is that affecting your everyday decisions? And in Susie's case, it was [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4714.360000000001s)]
*  affecting her everyday decision to the point where she was lying to her husband. She was taking out, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4719.0s)]
*  if I recall correctly, second mortgages on her homes and spending $400,000 that she did not have. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4723.0s)]
*  I had the emails, the messages back and forth with her and the rep from that company. And she was [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4728.04s)]
*  begging them to cut her off. I've spent $4,000 last night. Please don't let me cut me off. Oh, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4733.48s)]
*  Susie, no Susie, we love you. We'd hate to see you leave. Here's a billion free coins. You know, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4738.84s)]
*  if you still want to quit when you're done with that. It's a drug dealer. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4743.8s)]
*  Well, that's what's interesting to me too. It's like, when would we stop [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4747.32s)]
*  allowing certain things you would think, like even pornography, right? Like I've fallen victim, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4751.5599999999995s)]
*  victim to it, obviously. And, um, a lot of people use it, right? But it's like at a certain point, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4758.5199999999995s)]
*  I recognize, oh, I'm not using this safely, right? Like I go use it when I'm feeling down or when I'm [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4765.08s)]
*  agitated or something. It's like, and then, um, just like it's bad. We know it's probably bad for [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4771.96s)]
*  us, right? I'm not disparaging any of the people that use it or that, that perform it. I have [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4779.88s)]
*  friends that are in the industry. It's not anything against any person, but I wonder if overall, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4785.08s)]
*  sometimes we know that it hurts us or like they just had that documentary on Ashley Madison, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4790.68s)]
*  right? And it was so strange. You had this couple, um, pushing the company and they're married and [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4795.48s)]
*  the husband was the owner and they're saying, well, we don't cheat, but you might need to, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4804.5199999999995s)]
*  right? Life short, have an affair. Just like, it's just evil. It feels like, I mean, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4809.4s)]
*  like, why would we allow that? Like it seemed like if you took a vote amongst people, would we, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4815.719999999999s)]
*  do we want this in our lives? Right. That most of them would probably say no. But if you are [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4820.68s)]
*  tempted with it, if it comes in, like if a cat comes on your, if you tell me, Hey man, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4826.76s)]
*  do you want a free cat? I'll tell you, dude, honestly, you can fuck off, right? I'll tell [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4830.200000000001s)]
*  you straight up. But if a cat keeps coming on my porch, dude, I'm gonna go out there and touch it. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4835.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like at some point, even if I might be like, man, fuck this thing, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4841.08s)]
*  I might be out there petting at the same time. So it's like, you know, and is that our [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4845.0s)]
*  responsibility or is that cats in your pocket? Yeah. Carry the cat around in your pocket with [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4850.84s)]
*  you all the time. I guess you can get a baby cat. Um, but yeah, it's like, I guess I often wonder, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4855.32s)]
*  like, is that just our responsibility and, or is there, should there be a, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4862.52s)]
*  yeah, I guess you can't depend on the government, but you would think as a society, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4869.64s)]
*  we wouldn't want these things. Does that make sense to you? No, dude, totally makes sense. And [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4872.92s)]
*  I think part of it is like these things are being developed in, in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4876.28s)]
*  wherever faster than like we can learn about them and adjust to them. The government's always a few [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4881.96s)]
*  years behind. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and, and again, like, I mean, I don't, I mean, obviously [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4887.0s)]
*  I'm biased cause I am an investigative journalist, but like, this is the role that I think we're [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4892.6s)]
*  losing in our society by as journalism keeps going away is because like, in that story that [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4896.2s)]
*  we were just talking about with Susie and the social casinos, those dudes would suit me if I [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4902.04s)]
*  got it wrong, right? Like if, if, if, if like, they are going to ask for a correction if I got [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4906.68s)]
*  something wrong. Right. And they did it right in the end, Susie and a bunch of other people [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4911.32s)]
*  got 155 million bucks back from them. Really? Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Right. So, you know, and, and, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4916.92s)]
*  and like, I don't have it out against anybody, man. I just want good information out there in the [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4923.56s)]
*  public. Yeah. You know, like it empowers all of us, even if like, dude, it could be the same piece [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4928.6s)]
*  of information. And from that same accurate, good piece of information, you might decide that a is [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4934.120000000001s)]
*  the best course and I might decide that B's the best course. But to me, that's a democracy because [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4939.240000000001s)]
*  now you and I are tasking out whether a is better or B's better, but we're operating off the same [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4943.88s)]
*  good information. Right. Yeah. And if you're saying that other, that, that information is also [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4948.280000000001s)]
*  becoming like what's valuable and what isn't and that there's better information out there that [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4953.4800000000005s)]
*  obviously corporations can afford that they can afford the researchers now to privatize them and [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4958.2s)]
*  put them to work for themselves. Yeah. Then yeah, for the regular person, it just gets, it gets a [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4963.24s)]
*  little interesting, dude. I'm never going to have good enough information to tell you who are the [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4969.8s)]
*  people most likely to compulsively spend on something. Right. Those companies do. Yeah. But [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4974.2s)]
*  if I, if I'm given enough time, I can probably find out what the companies are that have that [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4978.599999999999s)]
*  information that are targeting people like Susie and I can at least make us aware of it. So we [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4983.8s)]
*  probably as a society will never have access to that. We probably don't want all of us to know who [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4988.2s)]
*  the compulsive gamblers are. Right. But at least we want to know who the companies are that are [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4992.2s)]
*  targeting people who have that behavior. Right. Or targeting people for whatever their weaknesses, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=4996.12s)]
*  right? Cause we all have them and we all have our weaknesses. Right. Yeah. And they can all just be, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5001.24s)]
*  they can almost be mathematically equated now or mathematically equated now. And they're attached. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5006.68s)]
*  And then that's used to attack us. I mean, that's the scary part. It's like, it's like, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5012.04s)]
*  I want to say it's like our reflection is using [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5021.64s)]
*  the fact that it's our reflection against us. I don't know. I can't know what I'm trying to say. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5025.8s)]
*  No, you know what it is, dude? I think you're right, man. It's like, they're creating like [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5030.28s)]
*  a data profile, like a virtual one of us, like evil Kirk from Star Trek. Right. And then like that [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5034.84s)]
*  person's telling them our weaknesses, right? It's like, you're looking in here like, God, that's like [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5040.84s)]
*  a version of me they've created. And that person is ratting me out and they're coming at me with [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5044.84s)]
*  that dude's info. Yeah. Right. I mean, it, and it's getting stronger and better, that technology. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5049.72s)]
*  Yeah. And then it also makes you a little bit upset at yourself because you're the one feeding [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5055.16s)]
*  into the same thing. That's, um, you know, beckoning you with things that'll end up being [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5060.6s)]
*  painful to you. Yeah. And I look, I have a stoic philosophy on these things. Like I, I, I believe [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5067.0s)]
*  that we can't control, you know, what happens outside of us, but we can control how we react [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5071.72s)]
*  to it. Right. And I think this is some of the, you and I were talking about cold plunges or like, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5077.16s)]
*  you know, just like how you can reset like, and it's super uncomfortable, but like you can control [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5081.32s)]
*  your body and your body's like, dude, I do not want to go in that cold water. And you're like, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5085.64s)]
*  no, no, I control you. I'm going to dip you in there for two minutes. Cause I know that when I [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5089.56s)]
*  get out, I'm going to feel better. Right. And, and part of it is personal responsibility. Part [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5093.16s)]
*  of it is being like, I control me. I'm going to set the phone down. Right. I'm going to delete [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5097.8s)]
*  that app. Right. Like we do have personal, but we also shouldn't be targeted in that way. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5102.12s)]
*  Right. It's crazy to let somebody continue to be targeted. It's like at a certain point, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5108.28s)]
*  you would stop a pedophile from coming near a child. Yes. Yes. At a certain point, if somebody [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5112.68s)]
*  had a hatchet and somebody was just trying to sit there and eat a sandwich, you would stop the [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5117.8s)]
*  hatchet guy from bothering the sandwich eater. Yes. You know, it's like, yeah, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5121.88s)]
*  could the sandwich eater get up and leave the restaurant, but maybe the solution is just getting [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5127.0s)]
*  the hatchet guy out of the restaurant. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Instead of making this huge [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5130.84s)]
*  hullabaloo, like now every sandwich eater can only eat sandwiches in this air or yeah, it's just, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5134.6s)]
*  cause some things are good, man. You don't, you just want to sit there and finish your sandwich. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5139.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, dude. Yeah. In the end, it comes down to our own personal responsibility for now. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5142.6s)]
*  That's it. I think that's a piece of it. And I also think we should be demanding better [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5148.76s)]
*  environments for ourselves and our children. I don't have kids, but you know, I always bring [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5153.56s)]
*  in kids because people seem to be more responsive, you know, but I think kids are living in, yeah. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5158.68s)]
*  And they're living in that environment. Right. And I don't know that those, you know, I think [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5163.320000000001s)]
*  we just need to be more proactive about what are the environments we want as a society. Right. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5167.72s)]
*  You know, but how do we get this? Cause it feels like everybody has kind of the same things in mind, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5172.84s)]
*  but we never seem to get them. And it feels even more like the voting is coming from the other side, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5177.32s)]
*  like that it's big business. Like, you know, like tech is the new fossil fuel. I've said that for a [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5184.599999999999s)]
*  long time where it's like, that's the thing that's power. It's like, you know, they control everything. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5189.16s)]
*  It feels like they have a lot of information, man. They do. They do. Um, yeah. Trump's information. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5195.8s)]
*  Then I wonder, well, I think like people, like the, like if all of us have better information, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5201.88s)]
*  right? Like again, like we can, we can push like the part, like the documentary, man, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5210.28s)]
*  like you were talking about it earlier, like, you know, like, I do think there's stuff in the [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5214.84s)]
*  documentary. It's going to freak people out. Freak me out when I learned about it. Right. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5219.0s)]
*  So at the end of the day, it's the point of it just to freak people out. No, it's to be like, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5222.76s)]
*  you know, we have no national water policy in the United States. You know that we have no national [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5226.04s)]
*  water policy. So that means that, uh, people from anywhere or any country, whatever can move here [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5230.2s)]
*  and use our water to grow their crops. It's, it's, is that true or no, it's true in some places, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5236.5199999999995s)]
*  like different states, different counties have different laws, right? Okay. But we have no, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5242.5199999999995s)]
*  we have no national water policy that just says like, wait a minute, wait a minute. Water is a [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5247.16s)]
*  big deal. Let's make sure that we're not using it for just like any old thing. Let's make sure [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5250.92s)]
*  that just like as a general rule of thumb, we're using it for like the best purpose. Right. Right. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5255.16s)]
*  And then let's help states and counties and these places come to the decision. What's the best [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5259.24s)]
*  purpose. We just don't other countries do right. Other countries have put that in place, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5263.32s)]
*  but if water is such a, is solid, like a, if it's so important for the future, wouldn't that be one [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5267.08s)]
*  of the first things we would do probably. But this goes back. It's like, I don't know that people [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5271.96s)]
*  know. I don't know if it just like when I have to go to, when I, you know, when I go to family [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5276.92s)]
*  reunions, I don't know that all my family knows. And a lot of my families, they're like farmers, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5280.84s)]
*  right? But I don't know that they know that this is the trend line that's happening. Right. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5284.599999999999s)]
*  And so you put this document or out there, not to freak people out, but so that we all just have [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5289.24s)]
*  this like baseline of information. Right. And then we can push our elected officials who, and, and, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5293.24s)]
*  and then you'll, you, you hear about all the different lobbies and all, you know, that push [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5299.48s)]
*  the government around the agricultural lobby is one of the most, if not the most powerful lobby [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5303.48s)]
*  in the country. And, and, and in part for really good reasons, man, you screw up farmers, like you [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5308.2s)]
*  can really Jack up a country. Like, we need to support farmers growing foods. Great. Right. And [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5313.24s)]
*  they should have a voice, you know, but at the same time, like communities that are around the [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5318.92s)]
*  farms and others and who's coming in and who's controlling it, that needs to make sense too. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5324.2s)]
*  Right. And so it needs to be a conversation and until people have good information, it's tough to [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5328.92s)]
*  have a good conversation. So whether or not we're talking about tech and like people targeting you, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5332.68s)]
*  because they're a big technology company and they know that you're going to be compulsive about this [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5337.24s)]
*  one thing and they can extract something from you, whether it's like how you choose to behave or how [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5340.84s)]
*  you choose to spend or whether it's like, you know, foreign company, foreign countries coming in or [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5345.96s)]
*  wall street coming in and pumping out water in places that really need that water right there, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5351.8s)]
*  you know, like we just need good information. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's, the days are over where [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5356.2s)]
*  people have anybody else's best interest a lot of over, like it's where companies certainly don't [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5362.04s)]
*  cause they're not an individual. It's a spreadsheet. They're thinking with a different, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5366.76s)]
*  yes, they are. They're thinking it's a spreadsheet, trying to have a brain. Yes. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5370.44s)]
*  And so like how, if you're China, right. And you now have like some of the biggest sovereign wealth [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5375.240000000001s)]
*  funds, you know, which is, what does that mean? Oh man. It's, it's crazy. Cause you know, I have [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5379.400000000001s)]
*  friends I grew up with, some of them got advanced degrees from college and some of them barely [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5383.56s)]
*  graduated high school. I mean, I was somebody that barely graduated high school, but you know, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5387.88s)]
*  they didn't go to college. Right. And so like, I have a huge spectrum of people I love and someone [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5391.400000000001s)]
*  will tell me about like the Illuminati, the Illuminati or control and things. I'm like, dude, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5396.92s)]
*  no, but go look at sovereign wealth funds, right? Sovereign wealth funds are countries like China [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5400.76s)]
*  that are pooling together these huge pools of cash, trillions and trillions and trillions of [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5406.6s)]
*  dollars. And then they can use that strategically to buy things, you know, to drive the markets [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5412.84s)]
*  how they want. Now here in the United States, we just believe that the profit is how everything. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5419.0s)]
*  So like, Oh, if you can make more money doing a than B, then you should go do a cause that's how [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5423.4800000000005s)]
*  our system operates. But China goes, no, no, we want to create the most jobs we can for the country. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5429.24s)]
*  And therefore we're going to take all of our assets. We're going to try to create the most [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5435.0s)]
*  jobs, not the most profit, but the most jobs. Right. And so then what happens is you have Smithfield [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5438.04s)]
*  foods, one in four American pigs, and you have a Chinese company and they go like, we don't care [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5443.639999999999s)]
*  necessarily about per se driving the maximum profit. Right. Like our government is saying to [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5449.16s)]
*  us that we need to go overseas and buy up food and water. So we'll pay you a 30% premium over [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5455.16s)]
*  the share price. Well, for the American company, that's like 30% premium over the share price. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5459.96s)]
*  Like I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders. Like I have to sell the company. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5464.28s)]
*  Like I have to give you guys the company. Otherwise I could actually legally get in [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5468.76s)]
*  jeopardy here for saying no to that offer. Right. Because I'm, I am, I'm legally obligated to return [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5472.04s)]
*  profits to the shareholder. Well, the Chinese company is operating under a completely different [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5477.4s)]
*  system. Right. And so that's where you begin to see, gosh, this is probably super in the weeds, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5481.56s)]
*  but that's where you begin to see like this international power play. And like you're [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5485.8s)]
*  talking about, like where the U S is so focused on profits, China's like, cool, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5489.64s)]
*  you're super focused on profits. We're focused on the future and we can manipulate you because [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5494.68s)]
*  you're super focused on profits. Oh, because if they own a fourth of the, of the industry. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5499.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Or they, they just know like the American company is always going to do whatever is most [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5504.6s)]
*  profitable. And, and, and we don't like, so we can buy that, you know, like they, they, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5508.92s)]
*  they know how our system works. Right. And they're getting better at manipulating that system [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5514.76s)]
*  is like right out of the gate. When I started looking at this, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5519.0s)]
*  So instead of this, of this American company saying, Hey, this is an American company. Let's keep it [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5521.24s)]
*  here. Let's keep it American. It's a part of like, you know, it affects our GDP, all these sorts of [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5525.16s)]
*  things. They just think, Oh, for profit. And China knows that it was like, let's just pay more and [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5531.64s)]
*  we'll definitely get it. That's exactly. That's a wrap. That's it. Because the way that the American [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5537.48s)]
*  companies built their shareholders would get upset if they didn't, if they took a vote, the shareholders [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5541.24s)]
*  were like, why didn't you do it? We would have made dividends or whatever. Why wouldn't you do, but we [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5545.799999999999s)]
*  could sue you and probably win if you didn't return us the max profits. And so China has, China has [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5549.08s)]
*  sovereign wealth funds, which are literally trillions and trillions of dollars of pools of [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5556.28s)]
*  cash. Whose money is it? Theirs? It's their money. Yeah. Individuals or the government? The [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5561.0s)]
*  governments. Okay. Yep. And the government can decide how to allocate that. Right. And so the, [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5565.0s)]
*  you know, if the U S had that, you'd always be allocating it for whatever is going to make you [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5570.68s)]
*  the most profits. China is going to be allocating it potentially for whatever gives them the most [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5575.24s)]
*  political strength, whatever makes them the most powerful country. It's very different. And that's [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5580.04s)]
*  what sovereign wealth funds are. And they've become huge. They're like, as I understand, I [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5584.52s)]
*  wouldn't talk to this professor, this academic at Stanford, who's one of the foremost experts in the [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5588.68s)]
*  country on these things, as I understand it, it's a fairly, they're fairly new, the Middle Eastern [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5592.68s)]
*  countries, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE. They also have really big sovereign wealth funds. China's got [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5597.56s)]
*  really big sovereign wealth funds. Surprisingly, Norway has a really big sovereign wealth fund, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5604.200000000001s)]
*  but they can use these things strategically, especially against a profit driven country [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5609.8s)]
*  like the U S. Wow. So it's crazy to think that being profitable could be your weakness. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5615.56s)]
*  That's interesting, right? Yeah. Wow. The world's largest sovereign wealth fund as of December, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5621.8s)]
*  2022 was China investment corporation, managing assets, reaching around a 1.35 trillion U S [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5629.16s)]
*  dollars. Where do we rank in that? Pull up like the top 10 list of sovereign wealth funds. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5634.68s)]
*  Norway, Qatar, GIC, the one we just talked about national welfare, I know China, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5639.88s)]
*  investment corporation and Tama sec that Singapore public investment fund could be us, but who knows [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5646.599999999999s)]
*  on Saudi Arabia. Huh? So those are the big 10 biggest sovereign wealth funds. So those can [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5654.839999999999s)]
*  really, somebody's got to have a list for how much assets each of them have at 1.7 trillion seems [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5660.679999999999s)]
*  small to me, but we're not even on the top 10 list. We don't, we don't operate a sovereign. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5665.32s)]
*  It was as far as I know, we, the U S doesn't operate a sovereign wealth fund like this [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5668.92s)]
*  because it's not how we think. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. You start to, yeah, you don't, you don't think [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5673.0s)]
*  about how perspective and mindset affects how an entire country operates really. No, the United [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5679.96s)]
*  States does not have a federal sovereign wealth fund, but several States do. These funds are [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5687.64s)]
*  usually smaller than international SF, SWFs and can serve different purposes. For example, the [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5691.4800000000005s)]
*  Alaska permanent fund corporation established in the early 1980s has roughly 67 billion in assets [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5697.16s)]
*  was created to ensure that Alaskan citizens benefited from oil extracted from state lands. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5703.32s)]
*  Wow. So that's important. And that's like Norway too. Norway's is very similar to Alaska where it's [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5707.96s)]
*  like they, they, they are an oil wealthy nation. And so they created a sovereign wealth fund [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5711.88s)]
*  to benefit the citizens. Oh, that's smart. Texas also it says has two sovereign wealth funds, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5717.08s)]
*  including the Texas permanent school fund, which was founded in 1854 and manages 46.5 billion in [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5721.88s)]
*  assets to benefit public schools. Wow. That's pretty incredible. Yeah. Just to think that they [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5727.72s)]
*  had that forethought. Yeah, yeah, totally. And they're going to think maybe I'm going to own [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5732.92s)]
*  the land, the schools on just different things like that. Yeah. And then so these foreign countries [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5735.64s)]
*  have these massive pools of cash that they can use strategically. Yeah. It gets, it gets [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5739.64s)]
*  interesting, man. You start like seeing the chess players on the board, moving in different ways. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5744.76s)]
*  What states are, are looking out for their land? What states are kind of at the head of the [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5750.04s)]
*  forefront? Were you able to notice any of that? Off the top of my head, you know, so like, I think [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5758.12s)]
*  Iowa has a law that, that foreign companies can't own farmland in Iowa. It's off the top of my head. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5764.2s)]
*  And, but like, is it, you know, like the question is, is like, does it really matter [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5772.6s)]
*  if it's a foreign company or a domestic company, if they're doing good by the local people, right? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5780.04s)]
*  Right. Like ultimately in that, like, who cares? Like, are you doing well by the local people? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5785.64s)]
*  Is there enough water there? Are you creating jobs? Like, you know, is it like people, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5790.68s)]
*  local people prospering? Like that's like, I don't know, at the end of the day, like what people are [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5795.88s)]
*  going to care about, right? Like, I think what becomes dangerous is when you see these things [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5799.32s)]
*  that are just like highly extractive to the, to the detriment, you know, of the local folks who [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5803.72s)]
*  are seeing their water disappear, who aren't seeing like a lot of job creation, you know, like- [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5810.280000000001s)]
*  Right. There's no return on it for them. And especially if it's their space, you know? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5816.52s)]
*  I even pulled up on that Saudi farm. I remember, I think I pulled up visas and they were bringing in [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5820.92s)]
*  workers, if I'm recalling correctly, from the Philippines, you know, so they'd be like, well, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5826.6s)]
*  we're creating jobs. And I'm like, man, you guys are pulling visas. So you're bringing in workers [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5830.04s)]
*  from the Philippines to work on your farm. Yeah. You know, like, yeah, you probably have, yeah, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5833.0s)]
*  you'd probably have farmers right in the area that would do it. Yeah. So, yeah. So these things are [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5838.12s)]
*  so many loopholes and stuff. There's so many tricky ways out there. Yeah. So when you look at like [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5842.84s)]
*  places not having enough water, right? America has a lot of water. Totally. Right. And a lot of land [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5850.68s)]
*  in a small population. Okay. So we're probably in a really good space. We're in a good space. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5856.04s)]
*  Right. Yep. What places aren't in good spaces? And we're in a good space, except for like these, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5860.44s)]
*  like regional examples, right? Like places in the West and the Southwest, places that are going to [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5864.28s)]
*  get potentially a lot hotter, you know? So I got these classified cables answering your question, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5868.839999999999s)]
*  like what places aren't in a good space. I got these classified cables and I'm from the U.S. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5875.48s)]
*  embassy that had gone. Cables, what does that mean? Like diplomatic cables that the state department [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5881.24s)]
*  was sending back from its embassy in Switzerland back to the U.S. government here. Sometimes that [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5885.32s)]
*  stuff goes to like the CIA, the state department, other. But cables, what's the term? It's paperwork [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5890.04s)]
*  or information? Yeah. It's like a report they'll send back. Yeah. Got it. And so some folks from [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5894.44s)]
*  the U.S. embassy in Switzerland had gone to the headquarters of Nestle and Nestle is like the [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5901.48s)]
*  world's largest food company. And the chief economist at Nestle sort of gave them a tour [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5906.76s)]
*  and like a perspective from the world's largest food company about how screwed up everything was. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5911.96s)]
*  And they talked about the regions that were going to get hit hardest by not having enough water. And [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5917.72s)]
*  so that's like China. It was like India, the Middle East, but it was also the Western United States, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5923.0s)]
*  you know? Like the Western United States is in a pretty tough spot when it comes to having enough [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5930.52s)]
*  water to keep doing all the things they're currently doing. And so yeah, and that was like [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5934.92s)]
*  the hot take from Nestle was like, you know, forget about it. That time it was like the, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5940.92s)]
*  it was 2009. It was the great recession. And Nestle is just like, forget about it. That's [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5946.44s)]
*  going to resolve itself. The world is running out of enough water to feed everybody. Right. Yeah. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5951.24s)]
*  And so do states start to plan ahead? You think some of them would? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5956.2s)]
*  I think some of them do these things like water. People will always tell you water is super local. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5959.64s)]
*  Right. And so some counties, some regions within states and some states themselves are doing [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5964.36s)]
*  better than others. And some countries are definitely doing better than others just in [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5969.64s)]
*  terms of like planning ahead, you know? And it is solvable, man. That's like the thing with a lot [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5973.8s)]
*  of the issues that we face, you know? Like we can, we're a super smart species, you know? Like we've [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5979.8s)]
*  done a lot of stuff. We could still do a lot of stuff. We just have to move off of the trend [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5985.96s)]
*  lines that we're currently headed on, you know? And those trend lines are more like me, me, me [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5989.64s)]
*  instead of us. Is that it? Or is it like, cause is there enough water for everybody? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5994.84s)]
*  There is enough water to grow enough food that everyone in the world could eat. Not even like [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=5999.0s)]
*  today, man, which we were, do we 7 billion people or so? Like there's enough water to grow enough [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6003.56s)]
*  food to feed 10 billion people, you know? Like it's not just a population issue. It kind of goes [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6008.04s)]
*  back to what I was saying about China, where it's like they just, now they're just wealthier, man. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6013.160000000001s)]
*  And they're eating more meat. And Nestle in that classified cable said like, if everyone in the [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6017.0s)]
*  world ate as much meat per capita as Americans do, we would have run out of fresh water in the year [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6022.6s)]
*  2000. Right? And I'm not a vegetarian. I'm not a vegan, right? I'm just like, this is what the [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6028.52s)]
*  world's largest food company is saying, you know? And I know people love beef and I know people [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6033.8s)]
*  love steak, you know? And like it's there, but like, but that's all of it. But when it comes to like, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6039.320000000001s)]
*  how can we shift? How can we take some personal responsibility to putting us in a place we want [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6045.160000000001s)]
*  to be? That's one area we can look at. And it's not even saying like you need to become vegetarian [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6050.280000000001s)]
*  or vegan. It's just like, how much meat do you need to be a healthy human? Right. Right. And you [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6055.0s)]
*  got people with obesity and heart attacks, you know, and all these issues. So you got people, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6059.88s)]
*  damn snorting meat out there. You got some real, yeah. Um, mammal pervs out there, you know, people [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6063.96s)]
*  who will just cook anything that wandered up on their porch, even to need it. I don't even share [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6071.4s)]
*  with their spouse either. I had a buddy that had a t-shirt and this is in San Francisco. So he [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6076.28s)]
*  definitely, he definitely pissed people off, but his shirt said, uh, meat is murder. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6081.56s)]
*  Delicious, delicious murder. Just trolling people. Yeah. Yeah. That's definitely, definitely. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6085.88s)]
*  People love it. Um, well you do have businesses like, um, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6093.160000000001s)]
*  Bill Gates is starting like a Beyond Meat. Is that his company or no? [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6100.4400000000005s)]
*  I can't remember if he invested in that one. There's like, yeah, Beyond Meat, Impossible [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6103.4800000000005s)]
*  Burgers. Yeah, I think it's Impossible Burgers maybe. Yeah. A lot of those guys got really, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6106.84s)]
*  they got funding. And again, those were like, that's a way to replace meat with a less water [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6111.08s)]
*  intensive meat substitute, you know, something that tastes like meat. Right. Yeah. Right. So [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6116.6s)]
*  that's one way that people could preserve water. Probably we still have to grow the, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6121.0s)]
*  yeah, it just requires a lot, lot, lot less water to eat a grain than it does to feed enough grains [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6126.2s)]
*  to eat an animal. Got it. Yeah. And what about other methods that people hear about like, uh, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6132.92s)]
*  desalinization? You hear about cloud seeding. Yeah. I'm not sure what other methods they are. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6137.64s)]
*  I believe cloud seeding is very expensive. Yeah. And I don't know as much about cloud seeding. And [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6142.84s)]
*  I remember like one of my buddies, he learned I was doing this and I moved off organized crime [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6147.4800000000005s)]
*  and I was looking at this thing. You gotta look at a cloud seeding. And I was like, dude, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6151.0s)]
*  that's some conspiracy shit you read online. And I looked at it and I was like, Oh no, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6153.240000000001s)]
*  people do really do cloud seeding. Like I think the ski resorts are doing cloud seeding. I think [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6157.64s)]
*  the Israeli government was doing cloud seeding. Um, but yeah, I think it's expensive. It, it, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6161.160000000001s)]
*  it hasn't really found a practical application. As far as I know, this isn't my area of expertise. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6165.48s)]
*  Desal, desal, I'm more familiar with cloud seeding is a weather modification technique [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6170.679999999999s)]
*  that improves the clouds ability to produce rain or snow by introducing tiny ice nuclei [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6175.48s)]
*  in a certain types of sub freezing clouds. So you have a cloud that's already there. And I guess [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6181.0s)]
*  you then, it looks like just fire ice particles into it and precipitates the rain out or something [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6186.599999999999s)]
*  for our operation, a four hour operation that seeds 24 clouds can cost around $5,000. Wow. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6194.84s)]
*  So rich people could have rain or something if they wanted to have like a Noah's Ark party or like a, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6202.68s)]
*  um, like a, the perfect storm. If they want to do a perfect storm reenactment of that movie, um, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6207.96s)]
*  per acre cloud seeding operations can cost around 40 cents per planet acre or 10 to $15 [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6214.44s)]
*  per acre foot for additional water. That's in Utah. Well, that's actually not, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6221.0s)]
*  you know, I, this is not my area of expertise, but 10 to $15 for an acre foot of water. That's a lot [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6225.16s)]
*  of water. And that's a, that's a really low price. Um, so if that, you know, and that's in Utah [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6229.72s)]
*  specifically, right? So they've going to have their own like climatology, their own hydrology, like, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6235.64s)]
*  um, so it can be super specific, but 10 to $15 for an acre foot is really cheap for water. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6239.96s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. Because you start talking about desalination plant and now you're talking about [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6245.8s)]
*  $2,000 per acre foot. Really? Yeah. So that's very expensive. Yeah. And like we're growing [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6250.68s)]
*  tomatoes typically with like $50 per acre foot water and an acre foot just, it's a, it's, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6256.12s)]
*  it's actually super simple. It's how much, if, if an acre foot is the equivalent of flooding an [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6262.2s)]
*  acre of land with one foot of water. Okay. Yeah. The global cloud seeding market is estimated to [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6267.64s)]
*  have a valuation of $131.4 million in 2023. Over the forecast period from 2023 to 2030, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6273.4s)]
*  it is projected to experience substantial growth with an estimated compound annual growth of 5.8%. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6280.839999999999s)]
*  By 2030, the market is expected to reach a value of 194.4 million. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6287.639999999999s)]
*  So it's getting more popular. They're saying this is a market insights website. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6292.44s)]
*  So if I don't know if that's legit or not, but what else does it say? Anything else on there? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6299.24s)]
*  Here's an article right here. Not since, not since Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6304.44s)]
*  in 800 AD has the American West been so dry. A recent study in nature climate change found [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6309.5599999999995s)]
*  the period 2000 to 2021 was the driest in 22 years and more than a millennium attributing a [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6314.92s)]
*  fifth of that anomaly to human caused climate change. Hmm. Lake Mead and Lake Powell have [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6321.4s)]
*  reached their lowest levels ever triggering unprecedented cuts in water allocations. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6327.24s)]
*  Cloud seeding operations have also expanded in water stress regions outside. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6334.2s)]
*  Let me see. Within the past two years, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and California have [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6338.84s)]
*  expanded cloud seeding operations. Hmm. So they're trying it. Yeah. And I mean, I know, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6343.32s)]
*  I remember the ski resorts doing it and, um, people are doing it. I wonder how much water [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6351.24s)]
*  ultimately you're going to be able to squeeze out of the atmosphere, um, by shooting these [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6356.679999999999s)]
*  minerals up into it. But yeah. And how effective is it? Like if you, if you spend the money to shoot [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6360.76s)]
*  the water, to put the particles out there, but cloud singing should not be thought of as a response [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6366.679999999999s)]
*  to drought experts agree for one in a drought, there are likely to be fewer seatable storms. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6370.679999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. And when there are storms, even the estimates from cloud seeding companies [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6375.48s)]
*  themselves show the practice increases precipitation by only around 10% in a given area. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6379.64s)]
*  That might be worth the effort when every acre foot counts, but it's not going to end a drought [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6385.240000000001s)]
*  across an entire region. So you have to have a storm already there. I see. Yeah. So that's kind [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6389.4800000000005s)]
*  of interesting. Super interesting. You can't just completely create a storm. Not yet. Anyway. Right. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6394.92s)]
*  Right. It's like terraforming the earth at that point. Yeah. Yeah. That gets right. That gets, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6400.04s)]
*  yeah. When it becomes like air Sims or whatever it's gonna get weird. And what about desalinization? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6405.08s)]
*  It's super expensive because like basically it, it, it takes a ton of energy, like electricity [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6409.8s)]
*  to basically push water through what's just like a giant filter and pull out the salt or whatever [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6415.88s)]
*  it is. It's contaminated the water. And so it ends up, the water ends up costing, you know, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6422.36s)]
*  a hundred times what, you know, farmers can are paying for it now. And oftentimes it makes crops [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6427.72s)]
*  unaffordable. So it's good for like drinking water. People use desal all the time for drinking water [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6433.0s)]
*  and for some industrial use, but at the price, it becomes very difficult to create food with that [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6438.84s)]
*  expensive of water. Are some countries saying you can't buy land here? Some countries are like that. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6445.8s)]
*  Right. For sure. Right. Yeah. Yeah. They, you know, and, and, and they're saying you can't grow that [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6450.04s)]
*  type of crop here because it requires too much water. Yeah. Right. There, there are people are, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6454.36s)]
*  the other countries are getting really selective as to how their water is going to be used and what, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6459.32s)]
*  what it can be used for. It's so tough for us to, because we've manipulated so many other markets [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6464.28s)]
*  and has done things ourselves. You know, you would go upstream from your neighbor and split that river [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6469.32s)]
*  that split that Creek that's headed your way if you had to. And that's what, that's what you're [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6474.44s)]
*  seeing. And that's, you know, people are just seeing like the river, their village relies on all of a [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6478.679999999999s)]
*  sudden now is diverted and it's a, it's for a palm oil plantation, right? Um, and that's more [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6482.76s)]
*  and more of what you're seeing in Africa and places like that. You mean, yeah, all Central America, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6488.68s)]
*  like Guatemala, I think has one of the largest expanding, um, palm oil plantation in the world. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6492.84s)]
*  We have, what do you think there's a way, a solution? Like, yeah, what do you look at is [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6499.16s)]
*  well, first off, I think people just need to know what's happening. Right. It's like bottom line. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6504.52s)]
*  Yeah. Bottom line. And then, and then dude, we just need to empower and push our government [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6508.200000000001s)]
*  to putting forward like the best minds. You know, I think like right now, basically the laws that we [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6512.68s)]
*  have on the books for water around this country were, are from like the 1800s. Right? Like when [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6518.12s)]
*  water, when there were few people, there was water was plentiful. Yeah. No gargling water in church [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6524.4400000000005s)]
*  and stuff. You're like, that's, that shouldn't be in the, uh, in the, um, state doctrine, you know? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6530.04s)]
*  Yeah. And, and now, and now water's tight and there's a lot more people. And so we, you know, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6536.6s)]
*  they need to go back onto the books and revise the laws to be like, okay, so what do we want our [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6541.72s)]
*  water laws to look like in this place? Given the realities we have now in the 21st century and not [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6545.72s)]
*  the 19th century, right? Like it's kind of, it's like all these stuff, man, it's kind of common sense, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6551.0s)]
*  but we're just not getting it done. Yeah. And it's like, how is it tough to get it done when, um, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6555.4800000000005s)]
*  a lot of the great minds, it feels like are working on the other side of, uh, popular sentiment. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6563.08s)]
*  Like a fair statement. Yeah. How do you mean? Like which, like that the best research is in a lot [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6570.92s)]
*  of great, um, journalists and lobbyists even are working for bigger companies, um, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6575.0s)]
*  or in the private sector more to garner information and learn information to give that to the private [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6584.92s)]
*  sector to better do their doings that they're doing. Does that make sense? It does. I think, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6590.92s)]
*  you know, journalists are always going to try to give the information to the public. There's just [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6595.24s)]
*  fewer of them. Right. And yeah, I think the private sector has a lot more resources to manipulate, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6598.44s)]
*  you know, the markets to what they want, right? Which oftentimes can be quarterly profits or [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6604.839999999999s)]
*  annual profits. Um, and we need our government to be like, okay, okay, okay. But what's in our long [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6609.799999999999s)]
*  term best interest, right? Like, what do we want for, for your, for your kids and your grandkids? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6615.48s)]
*  Um, and I think that's where, where we really need to be pushing folks. Yeah. And some of the, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6620.919999999999s)]
*  some of the companies are doing it not because they're beholding to their stockholders who are [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6625.4s)]
*  the very people who are wishing they wouldn't, that companies wouldn't do this sort of thing. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6629.639999999999s)]
*  That's really crazy. Isn't it? I mean, dude, you, you, you seen the duck and it's like in the duck, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6633.5599999999995s)]
*  man. It's like, so Holly Irwin is, is the county supervisor in Arizona that we follow and what [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6638.599999999999s)]
*  county is that in? It's in La Paz County. Okay. Right. And that's like a deeply red county. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6643.879999999999s)]
*  You know, Holly is, is a Republican, like a conservative Republican. And now she's, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6648.599999999999s)]
*  she's fighting for what people might be like, that's an environmental issue. No, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6653.32s)]
*  she's fighting for the water of the country, of the county. Right. And she's working with Democrats, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6656.04s)]
*  which is great. Like you got Republicans and Democrats coming together finally to like work [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6661.48s)]
*  on something and come up with solutions. Um, but what I showed to Holly was, and she didn't know [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6665.88s)]
*  this, you know, she's like, Oh, the Saudis have come, they're taking our water, you know? And I [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6671.5599999999995s)]
*  said, but Holly, look here, this is your pension fund from the state of Arizona. Look what it's [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6676.28s)]
*  invested in that farm right over there. That shipping hay to China and the UAE that was bought [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6681.48s)]
*  with your pension fund money. Like it's your own pension fund. Your retirement fund is, is helping [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6687.799999999999s)]
*  export the water that you need to stay, to be here and for people to retire here. But how I'm not [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6693.48s)]
*  following that. Yeah. Right. So like how they use the money. So they had a pension fund, but the [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6698.599999999999s)]
*  Saudis came in and bought the land. So that's a separate one. Right. So you got the Saudis are [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6703.799999999999s)]
*  there. Um, but there's another big farm, um, owned by, uh, uh, a company out in North Carolina [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6707.8s)]
*  and the Arizona state pension fund gave a bunch of money to that, to IFC, this company on North [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6715.8s)]
*  Carolina. And then IFC rented it to, uh, a company from the United Arab Emirates that's controlled by [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6721.88s)]
*  like the, the brother of the ruler of the country, the, the, the, that's controlled by a guy who's [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6729.96s)]
*  like job it is to control national security in the country. And so they're shipping it overseas. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6734.52s)]
*  And so like at the end of the day, Holly's pension fund, you know, she's like fighting so hard to [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6738.92s)]
*  keep the water there in her county. So people can stay there. And then her own pension fund is [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6743.96s)]
*  financing a deal that's shipping water overseas. Right. Cause it's more short-term profit than it [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6748.360000000001s)]
*  is a long-term vision. Yeah. And so how do you try to align those things? How do you, how do you align [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6752.280000000001s)]
*  with Holly wants money to retire on Holly wants water for her County to live on for the next [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6756.76s)]
*  hundred plus years. Right. Wow. Interesting, man. Um, what were some other, there was some other [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6762.2s)]
*  stories that I was investigating that you had, uh, or that I was researching that you had looked at. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6769.0s)]
*  Um, one that I found was interesting was this Somali pirate scenario. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6773.32s)]
*  So this was a guy from the intelligence community who told me this, you know, and, and, um, wasn't [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6778.28s)]
*  the only person that told me this, but he just said, look like Somali pirates, like we think of [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6782.12s)]
*  them as like pirates, like they took to the high seas, you know, like, but what they were, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6787.8s)]
*  they were fishermen. They were just fishermen along the coast and foreign trawlers from other [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6791.8s)]
*  country countries. I think his example was primarily China were coming in and just [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6797.56s)]
*  depleting the fishing stocks. Right. So these guys that are there on the Somali coast, they got pretty [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6803.0s)]
*  basic systems for fishing. Yeah. And then these big bad-ass boats come in with these super deep [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6808.360000000001s)]
*  nets and they just scoop up all the fish. So what are the dudes do? The same thing you and I would [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6813.72s)]
*  do if somebody was doing that to us, we come together, we sit around, we have a drink. We're [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6819.240000000001s)]
*  like, dude, how do we stop that? And we're like, dude, next time one of those things come through, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6823.72s)]
*  we're going to go out there in our little boat with some guns and take it over and tell them to [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6827.320000000001s)]
*  stop doing it. And we create like a little small coast guard. Well, that sounds like what they kind [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6831.56s)]
*  of did. Right. And so then they have a little coast guard and they're trying to fight back against [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6835.88s)]
*  these trawlers. And then they take one hostage and they're like, dude, you guys have been taking [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6839.400000000001s)]
*  all our fish, give us money and we'll give you your boat back. Cause you've been taking all our [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6842.92s)]
*  fish and they do. Right. And then they're like, well, that kind of escalates because maybe we [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6846.04s)]
*  should get a bigger, we should hijack a bigger boat next time. Cause now we don't have any fish. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6850.52s)]
*  Like we're not selling anything. We can't buy our kids books. We now they're in the boat [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6854.68s)]
*  abduction business. Yes. Yeah. Right. And so that's how these things evolved. It started as some dudes [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6858.12s)]
*  just being like, we just wanted to perfect protect our fishing stock, right. To being like, now we're [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6862.92s)]
*  taking over huge oil tankers and demanding. And then, and then when that happened and then the oil [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6867.88s)]
*  tankers hire mercenaries or private security corporations to come in, oftentimes former like [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6872.12s)]
*  special forces guys are, you know, guys that have, that have a background working for, for a national [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6876.68s)]
*  military service and they come in with guns and they're blowing everyone up. And you're like, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6882.28s)]
*  these dudes at the beginning of this story, these dudes just wanted their fish, right? [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6886.12s)]
*  They just wanted their food supply. Yes. Which is so ironic because it's really the same other, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6891.0s)]
*  same thing we're talking about. It is, man. It's like they just wanted to eat. Yep. It's super [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6896.2s)]
*  basic. And when they did, when you're not eating two months later, you are a pirate. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6900.52s)]
*  Yeah. It turns out, man, if we saw like something super basic, like just making sure everyone around [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6906.76s)]
*  the world has enough food, we're going to see, because this is the other thing is like [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6911.400000000001s)]
*  Boko Haram again. I mean, I could go on to these stories forever. And what is Boko Haram? It's a [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6915.400000000001s)]
*  terrorist organization in Nigeria and in that, in that region of the world. Well, that was where [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6919.8s)]
*  Lake Chad was. And if you look back on maps, a satellite maps of Lake Chad, like 30 years ago, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6924.92s)]
*  it was the giant lake. And now it's just like a pond. It's shrunk way down because people have [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6929.56s)]
*  been diverting the rivers that flow into it for farming fields. And the people that lived there [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6933.96s)]
*  that were fishing out of that, it was a huge lake. They lost their livelihoods. And then people start [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6938.68s)]
*  getting pissed. They start getting radicalized. People are hungry. Then like some, some people [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6943.96s)]
*  with crazy ideas start being like, well, you join my group, I'll feed you. People are taken from us. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6948.76s)]
*  All of a sudden, you know, just like, and it just spirals, man. And then you just end up with these [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6953.8s)]
*  crazy groups that are abducting children that are blowing things up. And like the beginning, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6957.56s)]
*  like the origin of that story was like people got thrown into by not having their basic necessities [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6962.280000000001s)]
*  met like food and then things spiral out of control, right? A little like man, Max kind of [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6969.320000000001s)]
*  style. Yeah. You know, I mean, it could get really weird everywhere. Yeah. So that's what like, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6973.96s)]
*  that's what we're hoping doesn't happen. Right. Um, but then, uh, you know, it's life, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6978.76s)]
*  it's always going on. Society is always going on in some form or other, whether we end up in tribes [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6984.84s)]
*  or whatever, you know, it's like, that's humanity. You know, you start to get this idea of what [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6990.92s)]
*  humanity is based on your own childhood and things you've heard, or, and also the safety [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=6996.52s)]
*  that we feel in America. Don't you feel like we've lost our tribes, our community though? Like [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7000.84s)]
*  everyone's got their little like a hundred percent sub suburb. They don't have to interact with [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7004.6s)]
*  anybody anymore. And like a hundred percent, everybody's just like, like, yeah. And it's, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7008.92s)]
*  um, I feel like a country of loneliness, man. I feel like half the problems we see is just [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7014.2s)]
*  cause people feel isolated and lonely and depressed. And they're not like, they're not like in a [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7018.52s)]
*  community anymore. And they're not seeing the same people every Sunday or they're not going out. Like [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7022.84s)]
*  dude, I play ice hockey, right? I play ice hockey and those dudes are awesome. And I am so lucky to [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7026.84s)]
*  be able to go and see that same group of cool dudes and just play hockey and have that community. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7032.28s)]
*  And like, I think a lot of us in so much of our communities around what going out to the bar and [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7037.16s)]
*  getting drunk and like, I used to drink a lot and now I think alcohol is a shitty drug, right? Like [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7040.92s)]
*  I think it's bad medicine. Like, you know, I think I view like, you know, a lot of this stuff, I think [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7046.28s)]
*  they should be viewed medicinally and yeah, it's just like sports piss almost really. I mean, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7051.24s)]
*  yeah, I don't drink. I mean, I prefer cocaine probably, but that's not even that good for you. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7057.16s)]
*  And it's like, I think, yeah, I definitely feel you though. It's like, where do you meet up with [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7061.8s)]
*  people? I mean, I go to a recovery meeting, so I've seen people there all the time. So you have like [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7067.56s)]
*  some semblance of groupness, but yeah, it's like everybody gets their food delivered a lot of times [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7071.16s)]
*  the family. It's just, you're staring at a phone, your food's getting delivered. You're not going [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7076.68s)]
*  outside. And it's like, how do we re-instill like a stronger community in the U S right? Because like, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7081.400000000001s)]
*  okay, dude, I have a little cabin in a teeny town, like a hundred people. And those people are across [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7088.36s)]
*  the board politically on the spectrum. And it doesn't matter if somebody's voting one way and [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7093.32s)]
*  somebody else is voting the other way. If somebody's like house floods, people are going to show up. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7098.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Right. People are going to help each other out. Like that's, that's what it is to be a good [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7102.92s)]
*  person. It's not who you vote for or what you necessarily like your political ethos. It's like, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7106.5199999999995s)]
*  dude, did something bad happen to you? Does your community come out and support you? That's community. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7111.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's what I feel like we're losing, right? We're so distracted about, I feel like petty crap [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7115.64s)]
*  right now that we're forgetting it's time. We just need to show up for each other. Yeah. I wonder [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7120.200000000001s)]
*  where if you're going to see more of an influx towards, like religious services, even not even [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7124.68s)]
*  entirely for religion, but for community. It's like some of the first places you go back to for [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7130.76s)]
*  community. Like one thing that I always loved about church was just seeing like the kids play [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7136.04s)]
*  together. You're all sitting there in peace, even it's like if you, if you're just in your own [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7140.52s)]
*  thoughts, like thinking of something bigger than yourself, no matter what your denomination was [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7144.76s)]
*  or whatever, or yeah. Yeah. So I grew up, my dad was a Lutheran pastor and, and, and I, you know, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7149.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't, I don't go to, I don't go to church anymore. I don't follow those beliefs anymore, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7156.04s)]
*  but I missed that Sunday get together, man, because you would show up and you know, there would be [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7159.96s)]
*  like a tax preparer there and you knew you'd see them every Sunday and you could rely on them. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7164.92s)]
*  There was a mechanic that was there and you knew that they'd show up every Sunday and you would [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7169.320000000001s)]
*  rely and they weren't going to screw you. And there was a sense of community, like in that [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7172.52s)]
*  community where people that had vocational trades across the board and you could trust each other [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7176.040000000001s)]
*  and you can know each other and you can ask them questions. You could get knowledge, you could share [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7180.4400000000005s)]
*  experience, you could carry each other, right? Like showing up to that one place every week and [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7183.88s)]
*  having that community. That's what I feel like so much is what that's been lost. I feel like it'll [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7188.52s)]
*  be a few generations and I feel like there will be a rebellious generation that will throw off the [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7194.4400000000005s)]
*  VR headsets and masturbate naturally if there's a way to do that into the ocean or whatever [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7200.36s)]
*  and reclaim what it feels like, or at least go in search of what it feels like to be human. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7207.24s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, man. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7212.44s)]
*  Jared Seifert That's what I think would probably happen. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7213.16s)]
*  Pete Slauson And are you talking about this with other buddies too? Because I feel like [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7216.759999999999s)]
*  I'm having this conversation more and more with buddies like, dude, how do we create community [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7219.32s)]
*  again? Like I said, it can be as simple as like finding a good hockey team, right? And just like, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7224.12s)]
*  because after every game, man, it doesn't matter if that game starts at 10.30 p.m. at night and [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7228.92s)]
*  we're not in the parking lot until midnight or like 1 a.m. Dudes are going to stand around and [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7232.84s)]
*  drink a beer and just catch up. Jared Seifert [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7236.76s)]
*  Have a blast, have a nice time. It's the same after any real get together. People always kind [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7238.6s)]
*  of mill around, see what's going on. You and one buddy or two guys might stay late if one of them's [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7242.76s)]
*  having a problem and they'll talk about it. If everything's cool that you're out of there, [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7247.4800000000005s)]
*  kind of like one of the first couple of guys out but you're joking around. Yeah, I think that thing [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7251.24s)]
*  is I feel like we would find ways in the end, I feel like you just believe enough in something [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7256.28s)]
*  that we can't create outside of us, that's inside of us, that would lead us to victory in some sense. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7266.04s)]
*  Like some human spirit or something that will prevail that always kind of feels like that. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7276.12s)]
*  I think it just feels like we're down maybe two rounds to one right now. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7280.04s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's tough for that human spirit to connect through a phone. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7284.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's hard man and I think there's a lot of like I have to be doing something all the [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7288.2s)]
*  time. There's a lot of factors in it. It's interesting to think about. Before you leave, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7293.24s)]
*  I know you worked in organized crime. You mentioned that a little while ago. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7298.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7300.84s)]
*  And what did you do in it, bookies or what was it? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7301.4s)]
*  Pretty close man. It was a lot of casino work. It was a lot of Asian organized crime. I went over to [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7305.64s)]
*  Macau which became like- [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7310.2s)]
*  Wait, that's by Hong Kong, huh? I went there once. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7312.44s)]
*  Hong Kong or Macau? [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7314.679999999999s)]
*  I went across the ferry there. I went to both of them. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7315.72s)]
*  That's a fun ferry ride. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7317.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it was nice dude. Some lady I think was either flirting with me or [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7318.5199999999995s)]
*  trying to tell me I had some on my shirt or something. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7322.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wild place man. They do more revenue than Vegas does now. It became massive. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7325.48s)]
*  When I was there, it had become just like in a very short period, it'd become massive. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7330.76s)]
*  And I was over there because we were looking into how what the US government, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7335.4800000000005s)]
*  largely considered was organized crime, people connection to triads, etc. were working inside [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7340.040000000001s)]
*  of the casinos to bring money from mainland China that could be gambled in Macau because [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7345.88s)]
*  that time there was like, I think it was a $5,000 cap, right? This was the law. You could only bring [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7350.360000000001s)]
*  5,000 from mainland China into Macau, but then you'd go and you'd go into the casino and people [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7355.72s)]
*  are betting like 500,000 US per hand. You're like, well, how is that money? And it was basically [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7359.64s)]
*  this informal credit network, which is like, we know you're good for it in China, so we'll spot [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7366.04s)]
*  it for you in Macau, right? But if you don't pay your debts, you're probably going to be found [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7370.92s)]
*  burned up and shot in your car. And so that was the ecosystem. And then these big US casinos were [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7376.04s)]
*  operating in that ecosystem. And so how does all of that? So I went over there and my job was to [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7382.84s)]
*  try to get these guys to go on camera to open up to me and to tell me about this operation. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7387.64s)]
*  And as one of the US casino bosses, a white guy from America said to me is like, he's like, man, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7393.08s)]
*  that dude whose casino you're staying in for the six weeks you're here is known if people [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7399.96s)]
*  say stuff he doesn't like for hanging them out their window. And that's where I was staying. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7403.96s)]
*  Gosh, that's a rough start. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7410.280000000001s)]
*  You just down there looking and we say triads. What does that mean? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7414.200000000001s)]
*  Triads are like a British word for what they would describe as Asian organized crime networks. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7417.56s)]
*  And the triads actually have this super interesting history that go back to martial arts, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7423.400000000001s)]
*  to the Shaolin temple, and to like all the way back to like the overthrow of the emperor, man. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7428.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like, it gets like that's why the triad guys are known for being such badasses with regards to [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7433.56s)]
*  martial arts. Like, I still get calls from federal prison pretty frequently from a guy named Raymond [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7438.280000000001s)]
*  Shrimp Boy Chow. And- Shrimp Boy? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7444.12s)]
*  Shrimp Boy. Amen. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7446.44s)]
*  Yeah. And dude, just crazy, bad ass martial arts guy. But yeah, he'll call, you know, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7447.5599999999995s)]
*  and I went to him because I knew I was going to Macau and he hadn't been arrested. Now he's [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7455.88s)]
*  in prison doing, I think, multiple life sentences. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7460.68s)]
*  Yeah. But that's just a, that's a different world, man, because you're operating [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7465.0s)]
*  in a world of violence. Right. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7470.36s)]
*  Yeah. That's how they solve it there. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7472.12s)]
*  Yeah. That's, you know- Things are punishable by real violence. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7474.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. Exactly. Yeah. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7478.28s)]
*  And it's kind of organized. So it's difficult to go in as an investigative journalist into that, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7479.88s)]
*  you know? And so the first thing I'd always do is just tell people right away, like, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7485.0s)]
*  I am an investigative journalist. I'm looking into this. You know, that's my role. And I don't [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7488.5199999999995s)]
*  necessarily need to push people for answers right away, but like, I don't want anybody thinking [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7493.08s)]
*  that like I'm sneaking around behind their back or like trying to be transparent about it. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7497.0s)]
*  Super transparent. So there's a different level of respect if you come in like that [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7500.599999999999s)]
*  over there. Yeah. And I do that with everybody. Like as a journalist, if I'm working on a story, [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7503.8s)]
*  I always identify myself as a journalist right away. You know, like this is what I'm working on. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7508.6s)]
*  This is my interest, you know, and then over there, it's like, we don't got to, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7512.92s)]
*  you know, deal with that right away. You can just identify me as a person, you know, in, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7516.6s)]
*  in parts of China that I've traveled to, one of the things people want to do when they're going [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7520.84s)]
*  to get into business with you is they just want to get hammered with you. Yeah. They just want to [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7525.16s)]
*  get hammered because they want to see what kind of drunk you are. Are you going to be a total [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7528.92s)]
*  dick when you're drunk or are you going to still just be like kind of funny and happy and upbeat [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7532.28s)]
*  and like honest or what kind of drunk are you? And so like, there are just different ways. And [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7536.599999999999s)]
*  so sometimes you identify who you are and then you just kind of a human for a little bit, just like, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7541.16s)]
*  just hang out. Yeah. I never wanted to be Chinese that much really. I mean, I haven't, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7545.639999999999s)]
*  I haven't not wanted to be it, but I haven't, I'll be honest. I, yeah, I haven't really wanted to be [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7551.639999999999s)]
*  it. I guess I would be willing to be it, but I don't, I would probably think about it a lot more [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7555.8s)]
*  than I have recently. Why do Chinese businessmen insist on getting you drunk? That's interesting. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7560.68s)]
*  In a culture where relationships can make or break you in business, getting drunk with a [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7569.4800000000005s)]
*  potential business partner is often viewed as a crucial way of solidifying that relationship [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7573.08s)]
*  and showing that you are in fact friends. Huh? Let me think. Is there anything about the liquor? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7576.92s)]
*  Anything more about booze? Alcohol is a very long tradition in Confucian society. Confucius who [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7591.400000000001s)]
*  advocated only eating at meal times and not in between made an exception for wine. He said only [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7596.6s)]
*  wine drinking is not limited. So Confucian really liked to have that. He liked to have a little sip [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7602.52s)]
*  in the daytime. No, no shade, no shade. Before you go, have, is there, have there been stories [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7609.08s)]
*  that you wanted to go to and you just didn't have the time? Oh dude, that's all the time. That's [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7616.04s)]
*  like the thing that haunts me most right now. Just like really important stories that people [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7618.84s)]
*  come to me and they want me to look into. And it's just like, it's super tough to find the time. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7623.400000000001s)]
*  There's just too many things that I would love to be able, I wish, yeah. So it happens. Yeah. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7629.8s)]
*  And who funds like investigative reporting? Who funds like guys like you? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7637.72s)]
*  So I work at a nonprofit called the Center for Investigative Reporting. It's like a super old [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7641.56s)]
*  nonprofit. It's been around since the seventies. It was a bunch of Rolling Stones reporters. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7645.88s)]
*  When Rolling Stones used to be based in San Francisco, they ended up moving it to New York [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7649.96s)]
*  and a bunch of the reporters didn't want to move to the East coast. They liked San Francisco. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7654.92s)]
*  And one of those guys was one of my mentors, Lowell Bergman, who I don't know if you ever [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7658.52s)]
*  saw the movie Insider with Al Pacino, but Al Pacino was playing Lowell. Lowell was the one that got [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7662.28s)]
*  the documents from, you know, inside the tobacco companies that showed that like the, they knew [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7667.4800000000005s)]
*  that it was a carcinogen. They knew it was addictive and they were hiding and not being [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7672.84s)]
*  straight up with Congress. So I work at a nonprofit, which is a super fortunate place to be because [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7677.56s)]
*  we're not profit. Like, you know, I worked on this documentary, that documentary could make a gazillion [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7682.04s)]
*  dollars and I'm not going to make it die more. Right. It's just not like what the drive is. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7687.400000000001s)]
*  Right. Right. You know, like, and so, and it's also because investigative journalism [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7691.64s)]
*  is profitable. Letting me, yeah, no, dude, letting me spend a year and a half diving into like [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7696.4400000000005s)]
*  is Facebook and the social media company targeting your weakness? It is not profitable. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7702.84s)]
*  And so we have to get foundations and others to give us money, to give us the time and people, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7708.68s)]
*  people donate to us to give us the time to look into this stuff so I can just share it with the [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7713.88s)]
*  public. It would be hugely profitable if I wanted to take that my same skills and go work for a [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7718.52s)]
*  hedge fund. I can make four or five times what I make. Right. But people are willing [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7723.24s)]
*  to pay me to do it. You know, like a modest salary, like I'll do it, man. Like, because I [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7729.4800000000005s)]
*  love stories, dude. I love stories. I love, like I used to sit and I was a little kid and I used to [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7735.24s)]
*  tell my grandma, my mom's mom, just tell me a story from your mind, you know, and she would just wax [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7740.68s)]
*  and now meeting people, you know, like, I just like to hear their stories, like what's their [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7745.88s)]
*  background, where'd they come from? You know, it doesn't have to be like totally revelatory. It's [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7749.8s)]
*  just like, we're all so complex. We're all so interesting, you know, but when I can spend time [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7754.12s)]
*  diving into something like Susie Kelly story, where like this crazy technology company identified [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7759.08s)]
*  that her brain had this weakness and targeted her, then I want to spend a bunch of time and [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7764.92s)]
*  share it with people. Right. Because we know it's not just happening to Susie. Yeah. I mean, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7769.24s)]
*  and it's so sick that that would happen. It was almost if you saw someone who was disabled and [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7773.4s)]
*  somebody, someone had a broken leg and someone kept kicking a minute, you know? Yeah. And that's, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7776.92s)]
*  and I do that. I think that's a really good analogy. And then like they were kicking them [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7783.24s)]
*  because it was making them money. Right. Yeah. And you're like, what are you doing? How are you? And [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7786.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't, I don't get it. I'll just tell you that like fundamentally on a personal level, I don't [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7791.88s)]
*  get it. Cause I couldn't do that. You know, like, yeah, that's the thing that's tough. It's like, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7796.2s)]
*  and then sometimes I feel like, am I normal or am I the weirdo that gives a fuck about stuff? [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7800.76s)]
*  Yeah. I'm saying, does that ever cross into your mind? Yeah, dude, it does. It does. And I don't [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7806.92s)]
*  know. I think, I think whatever, I think we're all broken in our own way. And whatever my little [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7811.4s)]
*  broken way has made me an investigative journalist. But whatever it feels fun though, could be Paul [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7815.32s)]
*  Revere, whatever, even though somebody said he was trying to meet men. That's the only reason he was [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7821.799999999999s)]
*  Is that true? That's what I've heard. But, but to be that kind of guy who's like, you know, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7826.28s)]
*  trying to, you know, like, yeah, we've always loved the underdog, dude. We are, you know, [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7831.96s)]
*  underdog. That's who you, you want the underdog. Yeah. You know, like everybody's like, [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7837.240000000001s)]
*  everybody wants a nude picture of like, Pam Anderson or something. You know, I wanted a [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7842.4400000000005s)]
*  new picture of Aaron Brockovich on my wall. You know, no kidding. Yeah. Yeah. That was a bad asset. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7847.56s)]
*  I'm covered a lot of stuff and got a lot of good out there in the world and pretty dying me too. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7853.0s)]
*  And I'll say that. And I think it's a compliment Aaron, but what else do we have? Anything else [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7858.200000000001s)]
*  that I wanted to talk about? I don't, I feel like we covered a really good bit, Nate. So we can, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7864.92s)]
*  people can donate to the center for investigative research reporting. Yeah. So the center for [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7869.08s)]
*  investigative reporting, that's a legitimate company. Yeah, man. It's a real legitimate [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7873.72s)]
*  nonprofit and, uh, you know, people can even just check it out. We got a, we got a, uh, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4FaNG1W3w&t=7876.92s)]
