*  You can't assume that pilots have a magical power [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2421.96s)]
*  Maybe they do maybe part of going through the air force and going through flight school [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2424.92s)]

*  Because you're on an island you guys there's no police coming. Oh, wow, probably a couple weeks [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2550.28s)]

*  Realistically, I think I would probably try to get the youngest people out of the plane of the crash first [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2584.28s)]
*  But even that's weird. You're on an island yelling for babies [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2589.56s)]
*  Well, because they have the most potential in life isn't because or you save the elders and ladies first [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2593.0s)]

*  What's first thing you're doing? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2628.04s)]
*  The first thing you got to do is be able to provide food for everybody [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2629.48s)]
*  Where oh like on the island? Yeah, trevor [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2632.76s)]
*  Okay [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2635.0s)]
*  The first thing you have to be able to do is provide food for everybody because people need to know if you're a leader or not [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2635.32s)]
*  That's true because if you're not a leader out of the gate, then I think [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2640.52s)]
*  You're you risk you take on a lot of risk [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=2645.32s)]

*  Uh, see, this is a true thing. I said it on my podcast, but I I thought stiff socks. This sucks baby. Yes, sir [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3658.1s)]
*  um, but I thought the dude fucked like like let's say [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3665.3s)]
*  Uh miranda is the surrogate. She's gonna hold the baby. I thought the dad like put it in I thought he like fucked her [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3670.18s)]
*  But it's not that at all. They just shoot it up in there [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3676.98s)]
*  Uh with like a you know, uh, not a syringe but a syringe type of field [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3679.94s)]
*  So you thought the dad went though dad and wife got a strange woman and the dad went out [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3684.02s)]
*  I was like, why wouldn't you want to surrogate? That's fucking well, it would say two birds one bone, baby [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3688.34s)]
*  Why wouldn't you well if you can get your wife to agree you're gonna save a lot of money because otherwise [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3693.22s)]
*  It's like 110 grand. I think to go to a center. Yeah drop it off the whole thing [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3698.34s)]
*  But I then that dude goes over there and does it yeah, what a creep that dude is right [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3703.54s)]
*  But that's also just weird. I mean and if you are a surrogate baby turn up [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3708.66s)]
*  But it is weird to nut into a cup and be like my son or daughter's in there and then you just hope [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3712.58s)]
*  But I mean, that's the same thing. I've seen a pregnant woman. You're like, hey, there's a there's a kid in there [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3718.18s)]
*  Well, I think we're good. We're getting past the days where someone's gonna carry their own child [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3722.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's getting weird. Like I think by the time I have grandchildren and I don't even have any children [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3727.86s)]
*  I'm also fucking lonely. But [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3733.3s)]
*  by the time [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3735.3s)]
*  Someone who knows me is younger [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3737.14s)]
*  they [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3740.26s)]
*  It would be very weird to be like hey look at this picture of when I was in my month [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3742.02s)]
*  I think that's starting it's gonna be you're gonna be in a center where you're gonna be [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3745.78s)]
*  Yeah completed. It'll be like you don't need a iphone charger to plug into the wall every day. You got a portable [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3750.42s)]
*  So you can be like I got a portable stomach that I can just have a kid in yeah [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3756.34s)]
*  Which you know, can you take the carpool in with that probably but that gestation now if you love gestation [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3760.7400000000002s)]
*  You could be like, oh i'm old-fashioned. I'm gonna have me a child, right? And people are like [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3768.1s)]
*  People that still roll their own cigarettes, you know, it'd be same type of people [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3772.02s)]
*  Yeah, I still it is mind-blowing to me that the body hasn't been like, uh, like give me let me get a part two [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3775.46s)]
*  Like how we I agree we got new iPhones every other goddamn day [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3780.98s)]
*  But how do I not have a drink holder in my hands that aren't my hands and I know my everyone's like oh your hands [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3783.94s)]
*  But like sometimes you're holding enough shit. You're bringing enough stuff in the car [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3788.1s)]
*  You're like I need a I need a fucking a big gulp right here [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3790.9s)]
*  You know something in between two of my ribs, right? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3794.42s)]
*  Exactly holding an eight. Why do we got to sleep for eight hours every night? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3797.54s)]
*  You know, where's the usb c charger? I can just plug in my ass, right? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3800.3399999999997s)]
*  Get going I think we're getting close man. I do know just some some stuff seems a little dated [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3803.94s)]
*  We used to have tails as humans, huh? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3808.8199999999997s)]
*  Did we really I believe so? Oh, wow, and then just over time so i'm wondering in the future over time [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3811.3799999999997s)]
*  What are we not gonna have? What are we gonna lose? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3816.98s)]
*  Well, I think at that point you start to look at aliens man [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3819.06s)]
*  You know you look at aliens and they're always the creature has big eyes big brain or big head, you know cavern head [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3821.7799999999997s)]
*  and uh [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3830.1s)]
*  Which was a nickname of some kid at our school too when I was a kid [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3831.7s)]
*  Yeah, he wasn't doing real well smart. Oh, I mean he passed away [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3835.54s)]
*  So he wasn't smart enough for god to keep alive [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3841.06s)]
*  But he was you know, he was I guess he was kind of handsome when they fucking dressed him [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3844.3399999999997s)]
*  But um a lot of fedoras on that boy, oh dude, I went to school and uh, uh, I had the craziest door but um [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3849.2200000000003s)]
*  they [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3856.34s)]
*  had a lot of the special ed kids dress up in suits one year to like [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3857.38s)]
*  To like one like there was a new teacher and he he's like we're gonna have all the boys are gonna wear suits and it was [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3862.7400000000002s)]
*  just like [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3868.02s)]
*  Yeah [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3870.1800000000003s)]
*  It was just crazy [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3871.14s)]
*  That he just to like impress the teachers just to like like why are the specially kids all in suit like it was like [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3873.06s)]
*  Did you want to suit the next day? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3879.22s)]
*  Uh, it makes me want to I mean, I think it hyped the game [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3881.38s)]
*  It definitely hyped a little bit of fashion at school. Yeah, so that was good [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3884.98s)]
*  but I don't I just think that overall I don't know if it was like [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3888.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, it was just kind of a weird move for them to do but um, anyway, what were we talking about? Oh [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3894.1s)]
*  Kissing that girl [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3901.78s)]
*  Human tails, what are we gonna have in the future that we're not gonna oh, I'll tell you this also [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3904.58s)]
*  So aliens if you look at if [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3908.66s)]
*  If you look at aliens [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3911.7s)]
*  How many humans are born with a tail 40? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3913.7s)]
*  Ever or like 40 cases. So how many is that 40 times to what 24? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3916.18s)]
*  So that's a hunt 288 [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3921.06s)]
*  That's per year. There's 40 tails. No, it's more than [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3924.02s)]

*  I think it was a real bad look [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3940.1800000000003s)]
*  But now it's more like you'll you know next you'll be in a video with willow smith in an hour [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3941.62s)]
*  Yeah, that could also be the extra hand i'm looking for. You know, you're fucking carrying in your groceries on that bitch [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3946.42s)]

*  I think if you look at aliens the head the eyes are big [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3969.86s)]
*  The thing their hands and legs there's nothing even to them [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3974.7400000000002s)]
*  Like you look at an alien's body it's always just like this long great it's not even you [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3978.9s)]
*  It's like they've they didn't finish drawing it [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3983.22s)]
*  Right, and it's like they just don't use them anymore. The simpsons only got four fingers. Is that true? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3985.86s)]
*  Yeah, people think that's for like, you know animation. No, it's just laziness. Wow [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3990.02s)]
*  I fucking forgot to put one on because that's the last thing you draw. Nobody's gonna start an animation with hands. That's insane [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=3993.86s)]
*  start with hands [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4000.3399999999997s)]
*  So like what is it? What do you mean? Like like, you know you start drawing [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4002.42s)]
*  An anim like of a person with their face and then you work down. Oh, yeah, so hands are the last thing you draw [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4006.2599999999998s)]
*  Doesn't even matter if it's three four. Yeah [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4011.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they got three middle and then one one thumb, but I like that. It's kind of cool [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4014.58s)]
*  You know, I mean, what do you really need? I mean some of these could go which which which finger you're taking off first pinky [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4019.3799999999997s)]

*  Yeah [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4034.5s)]
*  That's gonna make it real hard for a girl to be like you trying to you're trying to be forever and you're like I can't [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4035.46s)]

*  Yeah, it's much different. You know, it is different [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4610.74s)]
*  Well, you start to see what people are even some people you see also they want to be there [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4613.22s)]
*  They start to know the guy like I watched a show of brenton shaw's not long ago [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4616.98s)]
*  And I was like, oh a lot of these people are happy just to see him because they see him on video [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4621.62s)]
*  They see him on yeah, you know [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4626.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's like a lot of audience. They just want to come [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4628.34s)]
*  It really is like a showing of support like yeah like watching with a smile almost right [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4631.54s)]
*  It's like yeah, I think this they might be like I think this guy's funny [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4635.78s)]
*  They might think this guy's my favorite comedian [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4638.179999999999s)]
*  But there's also this other separate thing that it's just like I want to be there with this person, right? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4640.98s)]
*  You know [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4645.7s)]
*  And it was also cool to give me more assurance because after that show I was talking to you and you're kind of like yeah [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4646.0199999999995s)]
*  It was all right. It was a little like you felt a little like shaky on it [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4651.0599999999995s)]
*  But I was sitting in the car. I was like, you know, everybody was laughing the whole time [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4653.78s)]
*  So sometimes you know you forget you're in an outside this was outside of super spaced out, but every table had their laughs [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4656.5s)]
*  Yeah, but you know you said you're like, oh it was okay. I was like no you were crushing the whole time [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4663.06s)]
*  But it's weird. It's weird to think when you're up there that you might not be doing well [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4668.26s)]
*  But then you you put yourself in the crowd and you're like, oh it was great [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4671.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so it was cool to just be in the middle of it kind of just watch it [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4675.620000000001s)]
*  It was fun. Yeah [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4679.38s)]
*  I'll for some reason I always feel like I didn't do good. I think because I just hold I always want to do great [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4680.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but that means you care about the craft every I mean like maybe like twice in my life [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4685.7s)]
*  I've gotten off stage and like oh I fucking crushed it just sounds weird to get off and be like i'm the man, you know [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4690.1s)]
*  So yeah, so I wish I had more of that in me that right? I think it would do but it's humble well [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4695.94s)]
*  Yeah, but there's different times you get off. You're like, oh, no, that was a good set [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4700.66s)]
*  But I would never like out loud be like I'll fucking murder that shit. It just sounds crazy because then somebody else is like [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4703.38s)]
*  All right, seven minutes. Yeah, but if I'm if a woman hears it the like that guy's a king [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4709.22s)]

*  I just feel like coming up in the open mic scene you would hear somebody be like, oh I fucking crushed and then you like [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4719.9400000000005s)]
*  Watch her set and you're like [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4724.34s)]
*  Right asterisk maybe what does that mean? So you just kind of like [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4726.5s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to I don't know [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4731.14s)]
*  Maybe I think it's just an artist thing to always think you can do better [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4732.9800000000005s)]
*  I feel it's not right all the way every time I post a video [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4735.62s)]
*  I'm like I could have done this could have done that every time I go [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4737.780000000001s)]
*  Something's wrong in my head. I wake up in the morning and I think fuck man. You could do better than that [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4740.9s)]

*  He was just being that character right and that's what like the best acting is people that don't look like they're acting [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4913.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty tough man. You fucking you think about you for me acting feels like i'm just high [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4919.22s)]

*  But even damn fucking 75 people on set there's somebody who just brings you like a hair tie and you know [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4960.820000000001s)]

*  In your control [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4979.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, so you get to be the editor of it so you really get to be [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4982.74s)]
*  Do you think that's part of it? I think I think I like being in control [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4987.7s)]
*  I also I feel like the more people the more expectations the I think [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4990.74s)]
*  Like I love and stand up when i'm blinded like when it's like the the light is super bright on me [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4994.1s)]
*  Because like when I can see everybody in the crowd I get in my head and i'm like, oh fuck [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=4997.62s)]

*  Just do it your best that zone in on your craft because sometimes you're thinking and you see somebody like fucking like roll [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=5009.14s)]
*  Their eyes in the back, you know, like am I bombing up here? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=5014.5s)]

*  I would go to work and then I'd do like three or four open mics a night and then I would just try to just [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=6026.679999999999s)]
*  Just give but I like I wasn't talking about anything, right? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uRsKc7zSUQ&t=6029.719999999999s)]
