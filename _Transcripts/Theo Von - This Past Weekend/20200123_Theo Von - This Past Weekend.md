*  You know or they'll save it real quick another person like a heating environment and then get rid of it later [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3728.88s)]
*  So I never heard of that before my life. It's going on. Well, so what you're saying to me is this right? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3733.94s)]
*  I'm I'm 69 and a woman. I'm on top [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3739.4s)]
*  No, but just let me give you this scenario. I'm on top and I'm you know, I mean that commoner [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3743.0800000000004s)]
*  How do you say a mouth mm-hmm, that's so crude [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3748.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, look at nothing. Can you hear it in some of the stuff that's already been right right? So she's now [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3751.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, right. She has in her mouth. I'm her breath. Yeah, right, and then you go [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3756.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm gonna go pee and then and then she spits it in a you know warm container and then she uses as a baby [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3760.24s)]
*  Yeah, and then that's amazing. Well, is it crazy because right here we have an article and it says woman keeps sperm from oral sexual encounter [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3766.4s)]
*  Uses to get pregnant man sues. Wow [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3773.68s)]
*  Yeah, and appeals court said a man can press a claim for emotional distress after [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3778.44s)]
*  Learning a former lover had used his sperm to have a baby [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3783.52s)]
*  But he can't claim theft the ruling said because the sperm were hers to keep Wow [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3786.72s)]
*  Why? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3792.2s)]
*  By the Illinois Appalachia court sends dr. Richard o Phillips distress case back to the trial court [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3793.36s)]
*  They don't want to deal with it [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3799.4s)]
*  They moved it back [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3800.56s)]
*  But there's a ridiculous thing to sue for because I'm gonna say that that's right [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3801.6s)]
*  If you stole my toenail mm-hmm like clip my nails and you I just left them on the table [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3805.04s)]
*  Right, and then you took it right? That's yours [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3810.84s)]
*  But what if your toenails had little use inside of them and I took them and [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3817.6400000000003s)]
*  Created those little use how would you feel about it? Like you cloned me based you took the DNA from the toenail [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3823.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, that's exactly what this lady's doing. She's taking I think that there's there's a way [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3830.0800000000004s)]
*  I think that like bro, you just have to be conscious [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3833.84s)]
*  Like for instance you nut in the mouth and you look and you go I need to see you spit it out or swallow [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3837.56s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3843.52s)]
*  Right now. Where oh, where is it? Where are you Flint, Michigan? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3845.28s)]
*  If you say she's like, where are you if she goes? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3849.2400000000002s)]
*  Like that then what I do is I go [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3853.48s)]
*  Right, it cheeks it spits out like that [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3856.08s)]
*  That's mine. You're right. You have to be more conscious [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3859.96s)]
*  I'm just saying it's getting down to it right where people are about cloning though, bro [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3862.88s)]
*  Okay, because some Chinese dude just got arrested for cloning humans where at his apartment [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3868.32s)]
*  For me a little apartment, right? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3874.32s)]
*  Let me ask you something right if you can clone a human bro, then the idea of God [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3876.44s)]
*  Are we creating men then or is God creating the man? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3882.28s)]
*  God's creating where you're out here duplicating anybody can make a Xerox machine [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3886.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like we already did that right we can clone other stuff [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=3890.04s)]

*  With especially men millennials [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMv-O5woCq0&t=4892.48s)]
