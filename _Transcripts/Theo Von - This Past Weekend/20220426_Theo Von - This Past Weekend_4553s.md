*  with David Spade. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=153.44s)]
*  Oh, I definitely have OCD. When I think about growing up, I used to think that there was like [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=183.44s)]
*  boogeymans, you know, so I would like, I'd have to open the closet and like, look up, look at this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=193.44s)]
*  corner, that corner, that corner. Where are we going? Please say you're rolling. Like just, I was in just [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=199.68s)]
*  severe. Dude, this is the thing. We actually had a question that came in, put it, this is perfect time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=205.28s)]
*  and why don't you get that up? Who are these hotties? Hey Theo, hey David, which one of you two would win in a fight? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=211.44s)]
*  Oh, is this even a tough question? I don't know. I think you could win, man. No, listen, the only [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=220.8s)]
*  chance I have at anybody is if all my anger for my dad leaving me comes out at once because it's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=226.56s)]
*  fucking percolating in there, believe me. And I get fucked with all the time. Always been fucked [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=233.2s)]
*  with as a kid. That's why I felt bad for Chris Rock. I go, he was always picked on and you grow up like [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=238.16s)]
*  that. And then when I'm on dates, people see a pretty girl and they go, oh, he's this fucking guy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=244.32s)]
*  So I've had him step right between us and start going, hey, talking to him. I'm like, she has a date. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=249.84s)]
*  And they're like, who? Fuck you. And then I go, oh, and even a girl sometimes goes, hey, come on, I'm with [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=255.76s)]
*  somebody. And they go, come on, baby. And so it's humiliating because they know I probably won't fight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. Oh, I see what you're saying. And they're 100% right. So I just take it. But unless you had that one power pop. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=266.72s)]
*  Right. And so I even told Glazer, I see any of these UFC guys, I go, just if it goes down, where do I start? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=271.76000000000005s)]
*  So obviously I'm going to lose. But where do I start? You want a good shot. So I get something and then they [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=277.68s)]
*  at least go, this little fucking pussy at least hit me. Yeah. Because my brother used to beat this shit out of me [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=283.36s)]
*  and hold me down. And there's so much anger and rage. But long story short, you'd win. But we would [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  never fight. And you got a cool shirt on today. We would never fight. Thank you, man. You're not fighting a guy [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=294.88s)]
*  who gives you these compliments. I appreciate it. That's a great call. That's a great point. Where did you get? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=300.4s)]
*  That's a good shirt. Dude, Sugar Sean gave us these. We saw his fight, man. Oh, yeah, that's right. We went to the UFC [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=304.4s)]
*  fight. Everyone loves walking around there and theos like this. Everyone's like, Rat King, squig, squig. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=309.76s)]
*  He's like, whatever. He's throwing cheese. Yeah. You're like, you kind of walk like this. You get to sit by [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=315.44s)]
*  Halle Berry, which is definitely. Oh, that's right. Shit, we haven't even talked about that. That was next level. Halle Berry was so [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=321.76s)]
*  nice and so fun. I know we're barely, but you know, when you sit right next to him, you have to talk to him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=328.64s)]
*  And I have to go, who's this guy? You know, I do fake questions. I know what's going on. But I go, do you think [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  they're going to wind up scrapping? She's like, in the main event? Yeah, I think they're going to eventually hit each other. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=341.68s)]
*  I go, good, good, good. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Sometimes you'll just ask chicks stuff just to get, just to like. Just have my answer. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  Or you make them sound smart. I go, oh, yeah, you know a lot. She goes, are the fighters going to fight? Yeah. And I go, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  ooh, someone's been here before. Yeah, you eat dinner in the evening. Yeah. Yeah. Easy stuff. And then something [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  happened. I think we spilled a drink or something happened, but we're right there. And then remember Jared Leto talked to you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=364.72s)]
*  Yeah. That was cool. Yeah. At first I was like, damn, that chick's fine as fuck. Then I'm like, oh, that's Jared. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he's still fine. And he's still pretty good looking, man. Jesus. Yeah, we stumbled him to him. We were on the way to the back to try to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  go to just get some food or something. There's a back room and he was just sitting outside. And yeah, but remember that was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=386.24s)]
*  sitting outside like a raven. Yeah. Yeah. He was like up on it. Yeah. Yeah, he did. And then we walked by and we're like, is that a person? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=392.24s)]
*  Yeah. I thought he flew away. Yeah. Then he flew off. And then he said he's he was very nice. Yeah. And then he said, did he live [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  somewhere near you or something? He's from Louisiana. Okay. So he said, I was like, oh, I'm out on this one. You're like, oh, I'm from Arizona. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=412.0s)]
*  I heard it rains hard there. Sheriff Joe country. I go one time we were all at a scorpion convention in Arizona. Who cares? I mean, it's sort of interesting. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  I had a bowl of time with scorpion in it. Remember I told you the other day, I go put a bowl of time with a scorpion in it. Yeah. And they have those. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=431.52s)]
*  Yeah. AZ all the way. So we're at the fight. We had a good time. We saw Dana. We saw Dana. Oh, yeah, we sat right behind Dana. He sat behind Dana White and he would tell us what's going on. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=438.56s)]
*  It was fun. You'd be like, hey, get out your blood cups on this one. You're going to get a. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=447.84s)]
*  You're like, it's it's big. It's like being in a Gallagher show. Yeah. Yeah. One time he like even had some blood on his hand and rubbed it on my gums. He goes, you want a gummer? Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=452.88s)]
*  Yeah. He's like, oh, this will help a little vitamin O. It is. They go, all right, put on your blood raincoats like Gallagher. And they smash the guy's head. Yeah. I think Rogan, was he at that one? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=460.88s)]
*  Yeah, he was there. So that was a wild one, man. That was a good one. There was some comics repping. Yeah, it's fun. But a lot of people knew you. Doesn't shock me. But it is that is sort of your crowd, though. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  Who is it? You mean like ruffians or like, yeah, UFC people? Yeah. Yeah. We've had a decent amount of UFC guys that have been on here. Actually, there's a picture of Dustin down in Emporia right there. Somebody made us. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=483.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, you know, it was fun to see him in the back just walking around. Yeah. Oh, and we saw remember who was there? Oh, yeah. Remember right? We walked in. Dustin came over and said, what's up? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's great. All those guys are very cool. And I like knock him out. And he's like, oh, but then remember, he didn't lose. He didn't win. He lost. He came in second. That's right. Oh, it was a that was hard for you to say. And it was hard. It was hard for all of us. But the hard one was he came in one day. He was he almost. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=494.24s)]
*  Won. Yeah. There you go. He almost won. And it was tight. And then he's such a fuck. His mitts are so huge. He shakes hands. He's like, oh, yeah. So then he's we see him. And remember, we're like, should we say something? You don't look like an asshole. Like, I don't want to talk to you because you lost. But we want to say hi. But you know, sometimes it's like, if you have a bad set, you don't want people coming up and giving you fake compliments and shit. But he was he was pretty cool. He's always really affable. You know, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=524.24s)]
*  real super nice and stuff. He was he was pretty cool afterwards, even though, you know, I mean, I know it's just that kind of stuff. It's hard. He's very polite. Even though his head was spinning. I'm sure like, what am I doing? I was so bummed. I'm sure. And this dude was good. He was at night, right? Yeah. He is. Sugar was out there. He's a real and he's AZ, right? Yeah. He's Arizona boy. Just had him on here like a week ago. We're getting out there. Did you play any sports growing up? Did you play any? I could see you doing like baseball. I could see you like baseball and you're like the guy that bunts every time or something. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=554.24s)]
*  They send you in. You're like the mighty bunter. They say, bunt with your dick. Just stick it out there and let it hit you in the nuts. And then it's going to go about a foot and then you run. And I go, if you can run, I go, you don't have any feeling down there. Don't you have like a little puss? And I go, well, that's rude. And also, it's a coach. I'm a coach. I'm not a scientist. I'm just guessing by eyeballing you. So but I would. I did play second base and I did like, oh yeah, I loved it. I love baseball. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=584.24s)]
*  And that's the hot corner. Second base is the hot corner. Second base was hot. It was actually more responsibility than you think. Oh, no, I think it's all the response. Short sucks too. But, but those are the two good ones. But you're getting shelled. Yeah. I mean, that's there's action. And then the coach say this fucking pipsqueak is getting too much action. And then the worst is in third grade that the pitcher went down. Oh, what happened? I got called up like wild thing to pick. Yeah. The biggest puss in the fucking tricycle. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=614.24s)]
*  I stayed there. Yeah. They go, Spade, you're up. I go up what? I go, I can barely throw it the first from second. So I have one bounce. So I pitched. I was like this doing all the histrionics, like stretching and shit. I was terrified. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=644.24s)]
*  Were you licking your face? Like, do you even know what to do? Were you like doing some of the wrong shit? I had like a cornhole bag spinning it around. I didn't know why. And then it looked professional. And then I put my black on. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=659.44s)]
*  I was sharpening my cleats. I was like, are we starting yet? And then I pitched. And these guys were so excited because it was just home run derby. I think I got 11 hits in a row. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=670.24s)]
*  And then they go, what were we thinking? Coach fired. There was a quick vote in the stands to fire the coach. Yeah. So that I played kickball. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=682.24s)]
*  And I think everyone played kickball. That was the last time it was kind of even. And then I went up for football. Oh, that was psychotic. What? Yeah, dude. Where? What school were you at? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=693.24s)]
*  Scrappy Saguaro and Scott's still at Arizona. They're good now. They have a great team. But I went just because my friends were. And you know how you do. Oh, yeah. There's no puss on the horizon at all. I'm not famous. There's nothing clicking. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=706.24s)]
*  Right. You're at that age to where it's everybody's still playing kind of. Everyone's fine. Yeah. And you know, there was a there was a varsity and there was B. So if you weighed under something, it was B. But you all started together. And then they put you on the B squad. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=719.24s)]
*  But by senior year, that's when I went up, I think. No, I was a junior because I got clocked so hard. It was fucking Lucas. Exactly. Remember that movie Lucas? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=732.24s)]
*  Is that about the alien? Let's pull up a picture of that. Can you? Yeah, no, I don't think. No, it's like Malcolm in the Middle with a movie. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=747.24s)]
*  Basically, well, I was a cross between powder and Lucas. Lucas is Corey Haim, was it? God, I love you have a big screen here. This is fucking professional. Corey Haim was this little puss and he liked this girl and he goes out for football. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=756.24s)]

He's like, have you ever looked at a grasshopper up close and he thinks that's a panty dropper. But the girl's like, no, I know I step on him. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=801.24s)]

*  I was like, well, 100 percent. Then another time I finally got on base. It was like the eighth game of the season. I don't even know. I think there was like a plate tectonic shift and literally like I just slid from home plate over to first base. Like I didn't really naturally get there by any skill of my own. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=909.24s)]

*  That's where I was having fun. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1491.12s)]

*  So pools, pipes, there's 22 foot pipes out there. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1494.04s)]
*  And that stuff was big in Arizona. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1498.36s)]
*  Like, that's one of the areas. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1499.64s)]
*  I mean, just West Coast and at least Arizona had some of that overflow. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1500.64s)]
*  It's a great no money pastime on my Instagram. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1504.0s)]
*  I like all these skateboard things. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1508.04s)]
*  So I it comes up my feed. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1509.6s)]
*  Well, yeah. And also they have all those abandoned washes and stuff [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1512.64s)]
*  for those empty washes in the. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1515.48s)]
*  Those aren't great. They're rough on the wheels because they're not as smooth. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1517.12s)]
*  But they had 22 foot desert pipes, which are 1000 percent illegal. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1520.44s)]
*  They're out in the desert. I don't know what they're making. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1523.88s)]
*  I'm sure that Rogan would have a field day with it because they're just out there [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1526.68s)]
*  for no reason. And then we go skate them. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1529.8s)]
*  And one time I was trying to get to vertical, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1532.2s)]
*  but it's such a wide transition because you're going, you're going up, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1534.1200000000001s)]
*  just trying to get halfway up. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1537.44s)]
*  But it's terrifying because vertical is 11 feet up. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1538.3600000000001s)]
*  And so I got to vertical and I was I was almost weightless [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  because you're so high up and then you're getting to where your feet [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1544.64s)]
*  are above your head, you know, because you're trying to lay out. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1547.24s)]
*  Yeah. A front side. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1549.92s)]
*  And then my my board, I lost, you know, kind of traction. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1551.0s)]
*  So it just I flew off the side from 11 feet up and just hit in my foot. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1555.4s)]
*  Jody and my brother, Andy. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1559.48s)]
*  They just saw a little puff of fucking dust come up. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1561.56s)]
*  And then you hear me go. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1564.24s)]
*  Yeah. I started crying. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1565.44s)]
*  It started crying. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1568.92s)]
*  Isn't it bad when you get hurt so bad that a sound comes out [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1570.48s)]
*  that you didn't even know was. Yeah, exactly. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1572.8799999999999s)]
*  The initial hit was like, and then I go, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1575.28s)]
*  like, they go, is there a fucking sheep over there? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1578.96s)]
*  I used to make when I would get real like. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1583.36s)]
*  Girl, trying to hide the pain, too. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1586.8799999999999s)]
*  That's the worst part. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1588.72s)]
*  Pretty through it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1590.88s)]
*  Dude, when you're trying to pretend like you're not hurt, you're like, yeah, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1594.64s)]
*  it's so embarrassing in front of guys. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1598.48s)]
*  Oh, so I ultimately the wrap up that story is I was doing the skate park. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1600.28s)]
*  I was trying to learn aerial axle stars [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1605.44s)]
*  where you go up, you do an aerial and you land on your trucks, do an aerial [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1608.56s)]
*  like you fly out about a foot and you land on your trucks and then you drop back in. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1612.76s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1617.0s)]
*  And this is why I knew I'm too much. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1618.32s)]
*  I couldn't take it. It's too scary. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1620.32s)]
*  So I do it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1622.36s)]
*  I miss it. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1624.28s)]
*  And I fall all the way down to the bottom as predicted. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1625.24s)]
*  Why I'm scared. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  And then I broke both wrists. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1630.84s)]
*  And the consensus around the bowl was get out of the pool. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1633.48s)]
*  Get out, get your board. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1637.8799999999999s)]
*  We're next. Why are you still in the pool? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1639.76s)]
*  And so I had to like get it sort of grab my board somehow and run out. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1642.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's hard. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1647.24s)]
*  And then, yeah, I'm like this. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1648.68s)]
*  And then and then I go, I think my arms are broken. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1649.84s)]
*  My brother goes, you're fine. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1653.32s)]
*  And I go, God damn it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1655.2s)]
*  Because we just got here. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1656.2s)]
*  And I go, all right, because we had two hours to skate. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1657.72s)]
*  So I go, all right. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1660.0s)]
*  So he has me lay on our Lee car. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1660.88s)]
*  Remember Lee car, that old car was like really tiny. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1663.08s)]
*  Bring it up. You're too young. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1665.64s)]
*  Show him a Lee car. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1667.08s)]
*  And so I laid on the hood and, you know, like on the windshield like this [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1668.04s)]
*  and my arms out like I'm on a fucking IV drip. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1671.48s)]
*  That's not it. That's the general league. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1674.72s)]
*  Yeah. What the fuck? Jesus. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1676.56s)]
*  Anyway, don't fire these guys till after. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1679.44s)]
*  And so it zooms in like it's back to generally. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1681.3999999999999s)]
*  He's like, oh, you mean, boss hog? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1685.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, no, you're getting farther away. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1687.2s)]
*  It's called L.E. and then car. Yeah, like a car. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1690.36s)]
*  Yeah, the car. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1693.2s)]
*  So I'm laying on the on the windshield. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1694.04s)]
*  And then the skate park guy goes, hey, Andy, you got to take your brother home. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1696.2s)]
*  He goes, fuck that. We just got here. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1699.12s)]
*  And because we drove all the way there and we got the car for the. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1702.04s)]
*  We had two hours and he goes, fuck. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1705.32s)]
*  And my stepdad is a doctor. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1707.6s)]
*  So I went home. He drove me all the way home, flooring it the whole way. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1709.28s)]
*  Because I'm going to come back. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1711.84s)]
*  You're like hanging your wrist out the window. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1713.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm terrified. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1714.52s)]
*  So much stress to one of my necks all fucked up. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1716.2s)]
*  So I get home. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1718.1599999999999s)]
*  He dumps me with my stepdad and goes, hey, fix it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1719.3999999999999s)]
*  He says he's hurt. He's a fucking pussy. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1721.9199999999998s)]
*  And he goes, well, it goes back to skate park. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1724.04s)]
*  My stepdad drunk, as always. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1727.24s)]
*  He's a doctor. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1729.6399999999999s)]
*  He goes, let's take it out and take a look. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1730.84s)]
*  So we go to take x-rays at, you know, 11 at night. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1732.76s)]
*  I look around the corner. I'm no doctor. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1736.84s)]
*  I see two cracks down the middle of it. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1738.84s)]
*  And he goes, he's staring kind of fuzzy and he goes, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1740.6000000000001s)]
*  well, let's sit on it till tomorrow and see what happens. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1743.48s)]
*  I go, see, they're broken, dude. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1746.68s)]
*  Even my friend goes, hey, dude, I know they're broken again. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1749.04s)]
*  So he goes, I go, what are we waiting till tomorrow? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1751.64s)]
*  He goes, just let's play it out. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1753.96s)]
*  I go, what are you saying? There's nothing to play out. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1755.76s)]
*  It's he goes, I you're a little bit rattled. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1758.1200000000001s)]
*  I go, they're broken. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1760.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm in so much pain, but we don't have Advil back then. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1762.08s)]
*  We don't have Vic and nothing. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and you couldn't even open a bottle of Advil. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1765.08s)]
*  I can't even imagine. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1767.28s)]
*  Oh, I can't do shit. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1768.12s)]
*  I'm just like holding up in the air like, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1768.96s)]
*  small whimpers, go home, sleep, impossible, so much pain. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1770.96s)]
*  Next day he goes, now he's clear headed. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  He goes, we gotta fix those broken arms. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1776.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1778.6s)]
*  So he just gives me a cast because I'm going to school. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1779.44s)]
*  No, he gives me a splint, Humboldt. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1781.6s)]
*  So I go to school, first day of freshman year. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1783.32s)]
*  And you know what? I looked cool. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1785.84s)]
*  It was right before the first day of school. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1787.12s)]
*  Freshman year, new high school. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1789.08s)]
*  And they're like, who's this fucking hard ass? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1790.6s)]
*  Wow, cause you had two splinter arms. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1792.52s)]
*  Now my turquoise quick silver shorts [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1794.48s)]
*  might've canceled out my toughness, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1796.32s)]
*  but I had a new OP shirt from Miller's Outpost. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1797.72s)]
*  I was like, what's up, what's up? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1800.24s)]
*  White hair. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1801.76s)]
*  I had all the components of being cool, but no game. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1802.6s)]
*  I was tan back then, skinny. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1805.0s)]
*  I had fucking long white hair. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1808.0s)]
*  I was a skater. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1809.12s)]
*  My brother was cool. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1810.12s)]
*  So my brother was cool. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1812.08s)]
*  And then I was a math guy, am I? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1813.36s)]
*  So then you got into math. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1816.6799999999998s)]
*  You went from baseball to football to skateboarding to math. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1817.52s)]
*  And I was always, this was eighth grade into high school. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1819.4s)]
*  So I wasn't doing that shit yet. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1822.92s)]
*  But I was a math nerd and reading and all that in school. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1824.68s)]
*  So I didn't have many friends, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1827.96s)]
*  except this little Vietnamese kid. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1829.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1831.24s)]
*  Named Shin. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1832.0800000000002s)]
*  And we would walk. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1833.0400000000002s)]
*  They name a lot of them after body parts too. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1834.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1835.8000000000002s)]
*  No, because his brother, Quad, oh, you're right. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1837.0s)]
*  So, no, but his sister, Clavicle, wait a second. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1840.16s)]
*  So I was smart for a while there, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1844.2s)]
*  and then it tapered off. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1847.68s)]
*  But in second grade, I went down to fourth grade [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  for reading and math, me and Shin. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1852.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1854.28s)]
*  You went from second to fourth grade? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1855.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1856.68s)]
*  They're like, fuck, third grade, you're going all the way? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1857.52s)]
*  Yeah, third grade is a fucking joke for me. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1859.28s)]
*  So I'd go down and go, hey, gals, gotta run. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1861.3200000000002s)]
*  Gotta run down to fourth grade for reading and math. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1863.68s)]
*  Be back soon, BRB. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1865.8000000000002s)]
*  But nobody cared. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1867.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they have bigger racers down there too. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1868.6000000000001s)]
*  I go, it's a whole new world, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1870.44s)]
*  and you guys aren't ready for it. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1872.6000000000001s)]
*  So I go down there, and then I got into chess, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1874.0800000000002s)]
*  and I was spelling bee champ in sixth grade. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1878.32s)]
*  I was chess champ. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1881.08s)]
*  I read 47 books in fifth grade. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1882.0s)]
*  Did you do that Pizza Hut thing, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1886.04s)]
*  where you get the pizza pan pizza if you read the books? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1887.48s)]
*  Did they do that? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1889.76s)]
*  No, that might've been the Louisiana area. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1890.6s)]
*  Where you took it over there, yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1893.2s)]
*  I think they baited you for reading for food. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1894.52s)]
*  Baited you, yeah. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1896.1599999999999s)]

*  It's called the Read and Feed Program. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1899.84s)]
*  No, I went to state chess. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1902.8s)]
*  No, but I got measles. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1906.0s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't play. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1907.08s)]
*  For spelling bee? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1908.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh, for chess. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1910.28s)]
*  Oh, I went to spelling bee state, and I got smoked. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1911.56s)]
*  And then I went chess, I fell out [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1913.92s)]
*  because I had measles for three weeks. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1915.68s)]
*  We've talked about the spelling bee word. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1918.08s)]
*  Because remember, I got beat on inconvenience. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1919.84s)]
*  This girl in our class or whatever was pregnant, right? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1921.76s)]
*  This girl, Helena, and I don't want to say her last name, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1926.6s)]
*  but it's the Helena that was pregnant, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1929.6s)]
*  if you're listening and went to school with me. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1933.2s)]
*  Every story, you're like, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1934.76s)]
*  Helena had a rib in her forehead. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1935.6s)]
*  Well, she got pregnant, right? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1938.32s)]
*  She's in fifth grade. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1939.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I heard about this. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1940.52s)]
*  She should be in the Guinness Book, but go ahead. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1941.8s)]
*  And we didn't know you could even get pregnant, right? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1943.56s)]
*  But she won the fucking spelling bee, dude. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1945.6799999999998s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1950.8799999999999s)]
*  Wow. Unbelievable. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1951.7199999999998s)]
*  And people were calling her all kinds of racial slurs [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1953.08s)]
*  and stuff, but I remember, and she was white. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1955.3999999999999s)]

*  They're just mean then, they're just trying to be mean. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1960.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, nobody was trying to be like helpful. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1962.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1964.28s)]
*  But also, I remember inconvenience, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1965.24s)]
*  and I tried to spell it, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1968.24s)]
*  and I was up there hot dogging and shit, and I got. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1969.08s)]
*  Hot dogging? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1971.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that was it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1971.84s)]
*  Well, my first word was apparatus, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1974.2s)]
*  and I go, AP, AP, and they go, errr. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1975.84s)]
*  I go, come on, I fixed it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1979.2s)]
*  I didn't say that was the final one. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1982.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1984.48s)]
*  And they shut you down like that? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1985.32s)]
*  Security walks me out. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1986.48s)]
*  Hey, we don't want a scene. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1987.92s)]
*  So I came back, my mom's like, how was it? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1989.68s)]
*  I go, I won. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1992.96s)]
*  You lied to her? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1994.6s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1995.48s)]
*  I said I got fucking smoked. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1996.32s)]
*  But I got chess, and then I got older. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=1997.52s)]
*  Oh, so when I watched, I remember I was with this comic, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2001.76s)]
*  you know, like, I was probably 25, and we, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2005.76s)]
*  and he, yeah, he heard that story, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2010.0s)]
*  and he never believed it, and he goes, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2012.04s)]
*  we went to this movie where it was about a kid [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2013.12s)]
*  that was gonna play the best chess champion in the world. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2015.48s)]
*  It was some stupid movie. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2017.6s)]
*  Don't pull it up, I don't remember the name. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2018.76s)]
*  And then in the middle of it, he goes, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2020.6799999999998s)]
*  I knew you were a psycho, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2022.8799999999999s)]
*  because I was just watching it casually, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2023.76s)]
*  and then they're showing the chessboard, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2025.04s)]
*  and in the middle of it, he makes one move, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2027.4s)]
*  and I go, no! [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2028.72s)]
*  And he goes, the fuck, I go, god damn, the queen! [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2030.08s)]
*  And then they go, and what happened was that was a huge, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2033.8s)]
*  just fuck up, because the guy took his queen, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2037.6s)]
*  but I got it within milliseconds. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2040.2s)]
*  So I was looking at him going, don't do it, don't do it. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2042.36s)]
*  Anyway, so then, oh, I had a story to tell you about. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2044.84s)]
*  We were saying about when you're at the Oscar party, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2049.28s)]
*  it's hard to, if anyone's still listening, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2051.8s)]
*  it's hard to look cool at those places, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2055.1200000000003s)]
*  because everyone's so famous, and I learned that lesson, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2059.0s)]
*  because I was out one time with this young lady [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2062.0s)]
*  about 10 years ago, and she was sort of squirrely, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2064.88s)]
*  and then one time she goes, yeah, yeah, I'll go out. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2069.1600000000003s)]
*  Obviously not that into me, fine, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2071.0s)]
*  but a little above my pay grade, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2073.32s)]
*  she's really pretty and blah, blah, blah. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2075.32s)]
*  Yeah, we know your history, didn't we? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I go, all right, let's go, whatever. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2078.32s)]
*  So I finally, we're gonna go out, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2081.4s)]
*  and then, because we saw Casey Affleck, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2083.28s)]
*  and remember? Oh yeah, we did. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2085.2000000000003s)]
*  I said something so stupid to him. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was so great, you're like, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2088.48s)]
*  oh man, sorry, oh, I heard you just got, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2090.0s)]
*  I heard you got married. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2092.32s)]
*  No, I go, I heard you got married, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2093.44s)]
*  and he goes, I got what? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2094.6s)]
*  And I go, and then immediately, because I'm a little drunk, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2096.6800000000003s)]
*  I go, wait, what am I fucking talking about? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2099.48s)]
*  And he goes, well, I got divorced 12 years ago, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2101.7200000000003s)]
*  and then I have been single for eight years, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2106.0s)]
*  I go, yeah, that's it, I think. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2108.76s)]
*  I didn't even piece it together at all. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2111.44s)]
*  I just go, yeah, I just tried to run over it. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2113.2400000000002s)]
*  And I don't know what sound, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2115.36s)]
*  I'm just sitting there like, you heard the man. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2116.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you tried to back me up, but I had no case. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2117.44s)]
*  But it was so loud too, so we're trying to talk. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2120.08s)]
*  Anyway, Casey, who's also a studly actor, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2122.28s)]
*  so I always thought those guys are cool, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2125.1600000000003s)]
*  like, you know, these type, like Benicio del Toro, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2126.8s)]
*  I like Sean Pennant. He was there at that. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2129.36s)]
*  All these actors that are cool. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2130.64s)]
*  And so, in the old days, I take this girl out, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2132.28s)]
*  this is the lesson I learned. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2135.52s)]
*  So I know Joaquin Phoenix a little bit, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2137.04s)]
*  and he goes, hey, we're going over this thing, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2139.08s)]
*  me and Casey, if you wanna come by, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2140.64s)]
*  and just say hi or have a drink or whatever. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2143.12s)]
*  And I go, oh, I was, I go, yeah, yeah, I'll come by. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2145.3199999999997s)]
*  I go, can I bring someone? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2147.8799999999997s)]
*  Because the truth is, if you're around people [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2149.08s)]
*  that are kind of well known, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2150.3199999999997s)]
*  if you bring someone extra around, it's not bad, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2152.2s)]
*  it's just, it's risky. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2156.44s)]
*  It's eyes and ears where they don't talk freely, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2157.64s)]
*  and they don't want someone that might tell their story [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  somewhere or what you talked about or whatever. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2161.8399999999997s)]
*  So I gave him a warning, I said, yeah, yeah, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2163.52s)]
*  very cool about it. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2165.8799999999997s)]
*  I bring this lady friend, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2167.08s)]
*  and she's fucking all over them so hard. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2168.56s)]
*  And I'm like, immediately, I go, this is a mistake. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2173.08s)]
*  And she's like, oh my God, ooh. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2175.4s)]
*  And so she's talking, and then she literally, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2177.52s)]
*  if she's not sweating them hard enough, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2179.7599999999998s)]
*  she goes to one of them, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2181.32s)]
*  didn't you show your dick in a movie? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2183.2s)]
*  And I was like, this is a little out of line. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2186.36s)]
*  And he goes, oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2189.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're being respectful to me going, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2190.84s)]
*  fucking pull her off, dude. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2193.12s)]

*  Va va voom or something or yeow. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2199.04s)]
*  I don't think that's appropriate. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2202.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeow. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2203.7999999999997s)]

*  Sorry about this, dame. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2226.52s)]
*  I just drove her home, she's sticking her head up, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2227.48s)]
*  just staring out the window like a dog, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2228.76s)]
*  like how it was fun for a while, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2230.18s)]

*  On the way home. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2235.76s)]
*  Going fast forwarding, is this the one with the dick in it? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2237.28s)]
*  So I was horrified, and then I'm like, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2241.08s)]
*  by the way, those guys didn't like you. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2245.16s)]
*  She's like, oh, they both gave me their number. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2246.4s)]
*  I go, oh. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2248.0s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2249.28s)]
*  They were very nice and cool, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2250.12s)]
*  and then I said sorry to them, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2251.4s)]
*  and then she didn't say sorry to me. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2253.7s)]
*  And then that was that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2256.32s)]
*  I dropped her at the curb. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2257.56s)]

*  Don't worry, never happened to me. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2274.42s)]
*  When you put in, do the question that came in about the. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2275.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2279.0s)]
*  That fits in with what you were just talking about? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2280.48s)]
*  The girl, the guy, the question. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2282.32s)]

*  where they live? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2315.32s)]
*  Yeah, you could see that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2316.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, I think that's like Gold Rush or something. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2317.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of those. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2318.88s)]
*  Or Gold Salmon. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2319.7200000000003s)]

*  What's the secret, you think? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2325.0s)]
*  What is the secret sauce, man? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2325.92s)]
*  No, I think the only thing. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2328.1600000000003s)]
*  Because you're kind of the, you're almost, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2330.48s)]
*  you're not the underdog when it comes to like, labia, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2331.88s)]
*  but you definitely are like. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2334.48s)]
*  Labia. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2335.6800000000003s)]
*  That guy seems like a, you know. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2336.52s)]
*  Well, I think it was more, it was a combo of, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2338.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm on shows with pretty girls. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2341.0s)]
*  So like, I play a skirt chaser on [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2342.72s)]
*  Just Shoot Me for six years. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2345.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2347.8399999999997s)]
*  And there's always, they pair me with a pretty girl. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2348.68s)]
*  Then I'm doing it in grownups. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2350.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm like, hey, you know. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2352.48s)]
*  And then I do rules of engagement. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2354.6s)]
*  And so that's sort of the thing. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2356.48s)]
*  So it's a little bit blurry because they go, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2358.2799999999997s)]
*  oh, you date, but most of those are on TV. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2361.3999999999996s)]
*  And then in real life, sure, I like girls [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2364.3599999999997s)]
*  that are kind of fun, funny, and whatever my type is, cute. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2366.9199999999996s)]
*  But that doesn't mean they like me. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2372.6s)]
*  So I'm just, no one's looking at me going, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2373.7200000000003s)]
*  I gotta hook up with this guy. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2377.04s)]
*  Just, you know them, you talk to them. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2378.44s)]
*  And then maybe eventually, if you're normal in LA, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2380.08s)]
*  if you're actually just like reliable and normal, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2384.12s)]
*  that's a good quality because there's so many kooks [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2386.0s)]
*  that you start, they start to go, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2391.16s)]
*  ah, this guy might be all right, just because he's not [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2392.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2395.52s)]
*  So nuts. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2396.36s)]
*  Like you just, as long as you just stay the course, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2397.2000000000003s)]
*  eventually you're the only one on the road. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2398.4s)]
*  Or just be normal to them. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2400.0s)]
*  Because they're not gonna be jumping all over me. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2401.56s)]
*  So you just do whatever and then either you get a vibe [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2403.7200000000003s)]
*  at some point. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2407.08s)]
*  But there are some nice girls out there. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2408.28s)]
*  I went out with a girl recently and I really liked her, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2411.1s)]
*  but she was out of town. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2412.76s)]
*  She lives in New York and that's a tough one. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2413.88s)]
*  Tried and really dug her. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2416.64s)]
*  It just couldn't, it's just too tough. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2419.56s)]
*  It falls apart. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2421.4s)]
*  Was there ever a time where you were gonna settle down? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2422.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you ever have a moment, have you been married or not? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2424.36s)]
*  I don't think so, no. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2427.64s)]
*  Did you ever think about it, like seriously? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2429.48s)]
*  Was there ever a time where you did? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2431.76s)]
*  Because I struggle with that kind of stuff. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2433.2000000000003s)]
*  I struggle a lot with like, I don't know if I could, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2434.36s)]
*  I'd like to, I think one day have a wife or something, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2437.5600000000004s)]
*  but I don't know if I could, you know, sometimes. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2440.0800000000004s)]
*  I feel like I'm like that because I have run in [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2441.88s)]
*  to that situation that got very close and I go, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2444.6000000000004s)]
*  I would be scared to disappoint them. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2447.92s)]
*  I just don't know if I could handle it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2449.32s)]
*  I think we all ideally would like to find someone [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2452.1600000000003s)]
*  very, very cool. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2454.2400000000002s)]
*  And in your head, you can picture it [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2455.84s)]
*  and that's what you would like. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2458.6s)]
*  To have it happen, you watch it crumble all around you [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2460.68s)]
*  and you go, am I the one that's gonna beat the system? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2463.6s)]
*  Like, it's so tough. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2465.8399999999997s)]
*  And everyone's like, it's work. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2468.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want it to be, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2469.68s)]
*  because I've done it where it's harder than my work work. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2471.48s)]
*  Like, I'm just thinking about the girl. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2473.64s)]
*  They're going, oh, she's mad. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2475.52s)]
*  You know, what do we gotta do? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2477.2s)]
*  And so I never quite nail it and I will freely admit [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2478.56s)]
*  I'm a lot better at other things and that. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2482.72s)]
*  I try to get it right. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2485.12s)]
*  It's one of the curses of life. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2487.0800000000004s)]
*  It's very, very hard to get it right. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2488.8s)]
*  And I feel like it's unfair because I should get married [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2490.4s)]
*  and I should, I don't know. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2493.1600000000003s)]
*  I just don't wanna blow it. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2495.44s)]
*  And I watch my parents and I watch my people around me [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2496.52s)]
*  and the people always hate each other. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2500.36s)]
*  And I go, afterwards, I go, I don't wanna hate someone. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2502.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't want them to hate me. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2505.44s)]
*  It's just so heavy. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2506.28s)]
*  And LA doesn't treat it like it's a big deal. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2507.76s)]
*  People get married for press. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2509.96s)]
*  They get married for an Instagram photo. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2511.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2513.5600000000004s)]
*  And then they go, oh yeah, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2514.64s)]
*  the average marriage is probably two years. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2515.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's a year they hung in longer going, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2518.0s)]
*  we can't get divorced. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2520.48s)]
*  Yeah, we gotta at least be seen on the beach [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2521.64s)]
*  a couple more times. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2523.2400000000002s)]
*  But yeah, you'll see guys come out [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2524.2000000000003s)]
*  like they just came out of the mines. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2525.44s)]
*  They're like, oh yeah, it's been a good week with the wife. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2526.76s)]
*  And the guy's just like oil all over his face. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2529.04s)]
*  Yeah, and the guys are no date at the beach either. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2531.7200000000003s)]
*  Or the woman too. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they're all talking. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2534.08s)]
*  The woman will be like, Jesus. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2534.92s)]
*  Yeah, because they put up with a lot of shit. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2535.96s)]
*  And it's a new world. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2538.0s)]
*  There's Instagram, there's Tinder. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2539.48s)]
*  So used to be you met the girl you saw. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2542.6s)]
*  My friend in Arizona, he's got it made in a way. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2545.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm envious because he worked at this place. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2549.12s)]
*  He saw three girls every day in his day. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2551.4s)]
*  One worked at Circle K, one worked at the Pozo. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  So he picked the one he got along best with [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2556.72s)]
*  and they got married and that was it. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2558.72s)]
*  But there's no distractions in his life. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2560.04s)]
*  It's like that and he does that every day [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2562.64s)]
*  and they go out, they have their kids [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2564.92s)]
*  and that's the way you do it. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2566.64s)]
*  And then I'm sure he's got Grasse's Greener syndrome. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2568.16s)]
*  And then one girl said, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2571.0s)]
*  the one girl that I actually got really close with, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2573.36s)]
*  she said, I'm finding out as I get older, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2574.7200000000003s)]
*  the grass is browner. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2578.48s)]
*  And it's such a great thing to say [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2580.1600000000003s)]
*  because you see the married friends [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2582.5600000000004s)]
*  and then you see a little behind the curtain [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2584.92s)]
*  and you go, it's nuts. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2586.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm not saying anti-marriage. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2588.88s)]
*  I'm saying if I did it, I would do my best. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2590.36s)]
*  You're tying in someone else's life to yours. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2594.5600000000004s)]
*  And now you're responsible for two people and that's hard. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2596.8s)]
*  And you get their energy and your energy. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2599.68s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2602.7999999999997s)]
*  Especially if you're real honest with yourself. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2603.9199999999996s)]
*  If I know that I have these kind of maybe shortcomings [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2605.52s)]
*  or uncertainties, then if I know I'm gonna go pin me [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2608.2799999999997s)]
*  without even having cured these [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2611.44s)]
*  or just know if there are issues for someone else [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2613.2s)]
*  and I'm gonna go pin you. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2616.04s)]
*  When you get married, you're kind of pinning those [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2617.3599999999997s)]
*  into somebody else as well. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2618.9199999999996s)]

*  Yeah, Kyle's a fucking stud. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2679.16s)]
*  Yeah, Kyle's gotta get. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2681.72s)]
*  I mean. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2683.0s)]
*  Kyle goes. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2683.92s)]
*  He goes, I got a lot of shit from my friends [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2685.0s)]
*  because I was dating a girl 19 years younger than me. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2689.32s)]
*  And he goes, but you know what? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2693.1200000000003s)]
*  I was in college. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2694.4s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2696.92s)]
*  So she was one? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2698.6000000000004s)]
*  He goes, yeah, whatever. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2699.76s)]
*  That's a funny joke. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2701.6000000000004s)]
*  Did they ever have any like pyramid schemes [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2702.6000000000004s)]
*  or anything like in your area when you were growing up? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2704.36s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2706.44s)]
*  What a question. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2707.28s)]
*  Well, I think my mom was, you know, my mom was very tough. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2708.1200000000003s)]
*  She got divorced. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2711.6400000000003s)]
*  My dad left. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2713.2s)]
*  I don't think she had a big vote in it. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2715.12s)]
*  We got to Scottsdale and he took off. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2717.0s)]
*  Was he a criminal or anything like that? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2718.92s)]
*  No, but he was, we were four, six and eight, three boys. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2720.56s)]
*  So it's very tough for a mom with three boys. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2725.16s)]
*  Now we're starting to come back to why I'm crazy. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2727.6s)]
*  So she's pressured. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2729.8s)]
*  He pulled out of college, so she has no writing degree. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2732.52s)]
*  She's being a writer. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2734.7599999999998s)]
*  So she had to get two jobs, you know? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2735.92s)]
*  Department store, secretary, whatever. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2738.32s)]
*  Just to pay our bills and just to barely make [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2740.2799999999997s)]
*  and so we were just sort of on our own. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2743.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2747.76s)]
*  And then, but she, she couldn't even date really. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2748.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2751.64s)]
*  It was a very big sacrifice. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2752.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big sacrifice. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2753.96s)]
*  And then what did you ask me though? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2755.44s)]
*  I forget about that, pyramids games? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2756.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2757.92s)]
*  So she would get these jobs sometime [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2758.76s)]
*  where they would try to get her in on one of those [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2759.84s)]
*  like Tupperware, those kinds of things. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2761.84s)]
*  And she's such a sweet woman. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2763.2400000000002s)]
*  And you just see like back people taking advantage [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2765.52s)]
*  and all that's just such a tough world. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2769.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2770.84s)]
*  She really had it tough and she's still kicking [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2772.16s)]
*  and we all try to take care of her because you know, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2774.7599999999998s)]
*  that sacrifice you don't know to your older [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2779.2s)]
*  because I was a kid, I was like, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2781.48s)]
*  why don't we have more stuff? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2782.3199999999997s)]
*  Like we have no food, we have nothing. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2783.3599999999997s)]
*  But she was doing her best. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2785.52s)]
*  And then I got a few beans in my jeans. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2787.16s)]
*  So I said, well, I'm gonna take care of my mom. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2788.8399999999997s)]
*  She always said, I don't know. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2790.56s)]
*  Cause she will never ask for anything. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2791.6s)]
*  I said, mom, anything in my account is yours. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2792.6s)]
*  Like I don't care how much you need, just take it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2794.7599999999998s)]
*  Because I would never be here. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2796.68s)]
*  So got her a house and that kind of stuff. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2798.3599999999997s)]
*  But she doesn't wanna ask. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2800.56s)]
*  And sometimes I go, do you need money or something? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  Like how much? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2804.72s)]
*  I don't wanna open a full account at QVC [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2806.36s)]
*  because my money will be gone in two seconds. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2808.24s)]
*  But I do, you know, little bird fear. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2810.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2813.36s)]
*  Cause she gets like every hour, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2814.36s)]
*  it's like a morphine drip. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2815.64s)]
*  She calls me, turn it on. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2817.04s)]
*  Turn it on right now. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2818.56s)]
*  David, look at this. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2819.4s)]
*  It's a water bubbler that, and I go, what does it do? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2820.92s)]
*  She goes, oh, I don't know, but you grab it. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  There's 10 left. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2825.7999999999997s)]
*  I go, mom, you're exactly the crowd they want. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2826.88s)]
*  You bite and they give it. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2829.92s)]
*  Then they take the old 10 left special prize. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2831.44s)]
*  It's always like a baby diaper that sorts coins or something. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2833.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2836.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, oh, look at little Timothy. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2837.56s)]
*  Shit, a roll of dimes. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2839.12s)]
*  He's shit, but look at this. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2841.12s)]
*  Here's a roll of nickels. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2842.52s)]
*  He's impressive. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2844.2400000000002s)]
*  He's saving, bro. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2845.44s)]
*  Saving with every dump. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2846.48s)]
*  Get two things done at once. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2848.2400000000002s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2849.88s)]
*  So she's out in Scottsdale. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2850.7200000000003s)]
*  And my dad, you know, came in and out. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2851.88s)]
*  You have both parents? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2856.2000000000003s)]
*  No, my dad died. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2857.4s)]
*  My dad would be like 120 right now, I think. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2858.56s)]
*  And then my mom, I have my mom. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2860.72s)]
*  So, and we have a tough time sometimes, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2862.52s)]
*  but even hearing you say that, it just reminds me [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2864.6s)]
*  to just be more cognizant of that. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2866.96s)]
*  Our parents went through different stuff. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2869.4s)]
*  And they went through a different time. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2870.64s)]
*  It was just a different time back then. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2873.24s)]
*  You know, one time, my mom would get asked out [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2875.32s)]
*  and it would be ruined, because she'd let us vote. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2879.72s)]
*  No way, really? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2882.72s)]
*  She goes, one guy was, I think the heir [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2884.32s)]
*  to the Anheuser-Busch family. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2886.84s)]
*  I'm like, fuck that guy. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2888.24s)]
*  Randy Bush? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2889.64s)]
*  No, Anheuser-Busch, like the Budweiser. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2891.16s)]
*  Okay, wow. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2893.8799999999997s)]
*  He was, he probably had a million dollars back then. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2895.4799999999996s)]
*  I mean, money's nothing now. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2899.24s)]
*  Everyone has a trillion, but he was very rich, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2901.2s)]
*  but my older brother totally cock-blocked that one. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2903.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2906.9599999999996s)]
*  My older brother, Brian, but he's super cool [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2907.7999999999997s)]
*  and we get along great now. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2909.6s)]
*  But it was just being stupid kid shit. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2910.6s)]
*  But I remember she'd come home and she goes, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2913.08s)]
*  what about that one? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2914.4399999999996s)]
*  And I go, boo. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2915.2799999999997s)]
*  First of all, she didn't realize, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2916.3999999999996s)]
*  we all didn't want a new dad [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2917.6s)]
*  and we didn't want anybody to take attention from us. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2919.4s)]
*  So I'm like, you know, I've gone over it, mom, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2922.44s)]
*  and I think that's gonna be a no from me dog. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2924.32s)]
*  He's not going to Hollywood, yeah. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2926.6s)]
*  And then I'm like, I like this guy [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2930.72s)]
*  who's an ice cream man or something. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2933.88s)]
*  Now that guy had a certain something. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2935.84s)]
*  That guy's got a certain Johnnus Aquab. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=2938.7999999999997s)]

*  you know, when he rolled off. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3084.2s)]

*  I talked to somebody about that recently [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3758.06s)]
*  because then you can just be crazy. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3759.62s)]
*  Cause my voice is about the same, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3761.34s)]
*  but I don't want to be too old strapping the wig on. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3763.2999999999997s)]
*  And being like, what's crappin' in? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3766.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3768.46s)]
*  But I love the movie. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3769.2999999999997s)]
*  I love, first of all, I freely admit it wasn't a huge hit. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3770.62s)]
*  There was bigger hits out there I did, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3774.9s)]
*  but just to have one stay in the world for all this time [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3776.62s)]
*  and number one thing I get asked about. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3781.1s)]
*  So to have something sort of stick around [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3784.02s)]
*  and where I was like a decent person, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3786.38s)]
*  it usually I'm real sarcastic, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3788.34s)]
*  but it was like a good guy. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3789.82s)]
*  A lot of people related to it. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3790.66s)]
*  A lot of people get picked on. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3792.34s)]
*  It was very pro the South [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3794.18s)]
*  cause the South can sniff out when you're making fun of them. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3796.46s)]
*  And I wasn't. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3799.5s)]
*  I was saying, this is cool. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3800.38s)]
*  And everything down there is cool. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3802.5s)]
*  And there's a couple of bad guys, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3804.14s)]
*  but this guy's a good guy. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3805.18s)]
*  Just trying to get through fucking life. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3806.14s)]
*  So people sort of took it as like, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3807.82s)]
*  that's inspirational in a weird way. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3810.3s)]
*  Which is, for saying a movie that's kind of a goofy movie, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3811.9s)]
*  but it did have, that was the through line. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3815.1s)]
*  So that's why I think it hit with people. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3817.38s)]
*  And I don't want to mess that up, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3819.9s)]
*  but it is fun to do Jodder and stuff. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3822.06s)]
*  Snakes and sparklers come up every 4th of July [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3824.1s)]
*  and I sell some Jodder shit on my website. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3826.7000000000003s)]
*  It's fun cause you gotta keep it alive. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3830.06s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3831.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3832.7400000000002s)]
*  Was there ever a movie character that you got asked to do [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3833.58s)]
*  that you wish you had done or one that never panned out [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3835.7400000000002s)]
*  that seemed like it was gonna be really sweet? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3837.86s)]
*  Sometimes you'll kind of tell me [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3839.86s)]
*  about different scripts and stuff. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3840.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, sometimes it's not really like I turned down big ones [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3842.62s)]
*  that turned out to be super huge, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3844.7799999999997s)]
*  but there's some I just don't have. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3847.18s)]
*  Like if they told me right now, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3851.22s)]
*  we're gonna go do a movie in Europe for six months, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3852.58s)]
*  I probably wouldn't. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3857.14s)]
*  At this point in my life, unless I loved it so much, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3858.18s)]
*  it's just for the idea of like, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3861.7s)]
*  oh, I'm in a movie. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3863.7799999999997s)]
*  I like to act and I like to do that, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3865.9799999999996s)]
*  but I like to also do my own shit. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3867.1s)]
*  And it's hard sometimes to do other people's stuff [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3869.1s)]
*  later in life unless it's really good. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3872.46s)]
*  And I'm not always getting the top tier best shit. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3875.1s)]
*  So Sandler gets good stuff. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3878.14s)]
*  I mean, he gets great directors. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3880.06s)]
*  I see why he keeps working. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3881.14s)]
*  He gets that and if he just points out and they make it, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3883.1s)]
*  I mean, it's a power trip. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3885.5s)]
*  You just go, hey, I like this one. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3886.58s)]
*  And then big directors go, you wanna work? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3888.74s)]
*  So I kind of try to put my own stuff together [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3890.62s)]
*  and then it's more fun and you get more invested. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3894.7s)]
*  And if you got a little bit of money, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3897.5s)]
*  you don't have to work that hard. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3899.66s)]
*  I don't mind working hard. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3901.06s)]
*  You get to make your own choices. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3902.98s)]
*  At a certain point, you kind of get to pick and choose. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3904.06s)]
*  You don't have to take something that they just gave you. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3905.7s)]
*  And stand-up's kind of fun. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3907.54s)]
*  I mean, you go on the road. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3908.38s)]
*  I've had a blast on this theater tour we're doing. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3909.2s)]
*  Because you're responsible for everything. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3911.82s)]
*  So everything you do, if you do a good show, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3914.26s)]
*  it's because of you. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3915.94s)]
*  And you're not compromising, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3917.58s)]
*  you're not running everything by one. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3918.98s)]
*  You can do a weird joke that night and nobody gives a fuck. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3920.14s)]
*  Yeah, it is real comfortable. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3922.58s)]
*  I can't believe you just got in [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3924.38s)]
*  and started doing theaters recently, man. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3925.22s)]
*  You were doing all those clubs. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3926.58s)]
*  I know, I didn't. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3927.42s)]
*  And then when I did my special, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3928.24s)]
*  that comes out April 26th. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3929.7799999999997s)]
*  So the special was, and then I gotta get out of here. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3931.74s)]
*  But it might be today. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3934.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, I don't even look at the calendar. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3936.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3937.98s)]
*  But the special, I don't know if I told you, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3939.86s)]
*  we were gonna do it in Austin. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3942.22s)]
*  And Netflix said, you know, there's rules because of COVID. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3944.2999999999997s)]
*  I call it corona, old school. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3948.7s)]
*  But they said, you know, Austin won't go along with that. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3951.66s)]
*  The theater. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3956.26s)]
*  And I said, I get it, they have their own rules. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3957.1000000000004s)]
*  But so it was gonna get shelved for six months. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3958.78s)]
*  And I go, I have another show the weekend after. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3961.38s)]
*  Luckily I'm on kind of a tour. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3963.5600000000004s)]
*  I said, Minnesota, good comedy town. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3965.1400000000003s)]
*  I can add a show if this theater will do it. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3967.6600000000003s)]
*  And they said, yeah, we'll do it. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3970.6200000000003s)]
*  So we added a show, filled them both up, went in there. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3971.5800000000004s)]
*  And I didn't think I played Minnesota [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3975.78s)]
*  for I don't know how many years, maybe once in my life. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3977.42s)]
*  Went in and then my opener was on. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3980.0600000000004s)]
*  And I was like, God, it's not killing. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3982.34s)]
*  I go, this might be a tough crowd. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3984.98s)]
*  And that's the worst scenario. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3986.9s)]
*  The night before I was in Omaha, it was a blast. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3988.22s)]
*  And I'm like, but the one they tape. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3990.7400000000002s)]
*  And so I do my set, it starts out a little slow. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3992.94s)]
*  And then I get rolling. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3996.1s)]
*  But then afterwards, Bobby, the guy with me goes, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=3998.14s)]
*  oh, did you see they have masks on? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4001.66s)]
*  I go, oh, they did, fuck. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4003.22s)]
*  And he goes, not just masks, they give them N95s. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4006.38s)]
*  No. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4010.1s)]
*  That's like you're doing drywall. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4011.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4012.78s)]
*  And then you're like this. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4013.62s)]
*  And then you can't hear anything until once in a while, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4015.22s)]
*  they go like this. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4017.1s)]
*  They take it off to fucking live. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4017.94s)]
*  And then I go, use that noise. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4021.02s)]
*  We'll count that as a loud. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4024.2999999999997s)]
*  So I do a joke and you're. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4025.38s)]
*  So that was hard. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4029.66s)]
*  But I said, I don't wanna sweeten it [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4030.7799999999997s)]
*  and make it like fake laughs. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4032.7s)]
*  So just take the laughs, put them up 5%. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4035.02s)]
*  And if it doesn't sound like this big laugh. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4038.22s)]
*  It was pretty good shows. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4039.9s)]
*  The second show was better. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4040.8599999999997s)]
*  But I go, it's there. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4042.26s)]
*  You're just looking at the jokes anyway. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4044.5s)]
*  And they were a great crowd. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4046.26s)]
*  They couldn't be as great as they were. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4048.82s)]
*  Right, oh, it's insane with the masks. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4050.78s)]

*  I've never done one for Netflix. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4059.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4066.42s)]

*  And I go, quit chasing the last one that worked. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4091.58s)]
*  Hangover was during PG. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4094.5s)]

*  So get balls and just make whatever's good. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4099.22s)]

*  I have a wig in grownups. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4199.18s)]
*  This is a big story, I'll tell you. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4200.3s)]
*  I have a wig in grownups and no one even knows that. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4201.740000000001s)]
*  What happened was when we were doing the camera testing, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4204.02s)]
*  Sandler's like, all right, you're this guy, he's this guy. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4208.860000000001s)]
*  And I go, I'm gonna be the single guy still. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4211.22s)]
*  I got a guy from high school like that. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4213.580000000001s)]
*  He's still got long hair, he's in the 80s. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4214.860000000001s)]
*  He hasn't grown up. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4217.38s)]
*  And I said, if I'm the single guy, maybe I'll be like him. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4219.179999999999s)]
*  So I go get this blonde wig, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4221.26s)]
*  make it, I look like I'm the guy from Sticks [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4224.099999999999s)]
*  or something, it's down here. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4226.099999999999s)]
*  And then I go to the camera test. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4227.62s)]
*  Everyone thinks it's funny and then Sandler goes, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4229.94s)]
*  I want you to be better looking. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4231.42s)]
*  This looks kind of stupid. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4232.7s)]
*  I go, all right. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4233.7s)]
*  So he shortened it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4235.38s)]
*  By the way, it's so hot already, I'm in Boston, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4236.3s)]
*  which plays into this story. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4238.9s)]
*  So then they cut it. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4240.34s)]
*  And then I come back from the trailer. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4242.0199999999995s)]
*  We film it again. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4243.34s)]
*  He's looking, he goes, ah, shorter. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4244.18s)]
*  I'm like, shit. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4246.820000000001s)]
*  So we basically get it right where it is. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4247.66s)]
*  Maybe an inch longer. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4249.9800000000005s)]
*  He goes, just do that, it looks good. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4251.38s)]
*  And I go, I'm gonna put a little rat tail fucking, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4253.1s)]
*  what did I put in the back? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4255.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, ponytail. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4256.860000000001s)]
*  Like in the top. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4257.860000000001s)]
*  Almost no one sees it. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4258.900000000001s)]
*  It's on TikTok sometimes, people figure it out. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4260.1s)]
*  But I go, put this little ponytail in it. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4262.38s)]
*  And they go, all right, well, you can just use your real hair. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4265.3s)]
*  And I go, how about I just use this? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4267.46s)]
*  And they go, oh, and they go, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4269.9800000000005s)]
*  it'll take an hour out of your call time every morning. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4271.02s)]
*  And I said, I could just put this on like a hat. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4274.74s)]
*  You just put a brad in your hair, put that on. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4277.259999999999s)]
*  And I go, I have a hat. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4279.86s)]
*  So I put one in a hat sewn into the wig. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4281.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's just all one thing. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4285.62s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4286.74s)]
*  So sometimes I had a hat on. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4287.58s)]
*  And it took an hour less each day? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4289.86s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4291.299999999999s)]
*  So, and I have to drive an hour to the set. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4292.339999999999s)]
*  So I go, oh, I get an extra juicy fucking hour. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4294.7s)]
*  And no one even fucking knows exactly my hair. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4298.179999999999s)]

*  And then when people found out, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4302.379999999999s)]
*  they go, fuck you. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4303.5s)]

*  And I go, no way, dude. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4305.780000000001s)]
*  No way, dude. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4307.66s)]
*  And girls do it. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4309.02s)]

*  She just made her wig over exactly her hair. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4312.18s)]
*  She put it on. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4314.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a pain in the ass, but I like the Jodert wig. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4315.820000000001s)]
*  I like wearing wigs. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4318.02s)]
*  I don't wanna fuck with it. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4319.18s)]

*  That was the one I want. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4346.74s)]
*  Anything interesting happened in Covington [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4347.98s)]
*  that you remember while you was there? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4349.9s)]
*  No. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4351.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4352.259999999999s)]
*  No, but I didn't. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4353.099999999999s)]
*  The only reason I didn't stay there is because [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4355.66s)]
*  I had to go over that fucking bridge. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4357.86s)]
*  It's like an hour bridge. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4359.98s)]
*  Covington was beautiful. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4362.379999999999s)]
*  And they kept saying, was it John Goodman? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4364.339999999999s)]
*  Someone lives over there. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4365.9s)]
*  John Goodman allegedly lived up there once. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4366.74s)]
*  They told me that every fucking day of my life. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4368.7s)]
*  And I go, John Goodman, he might come by [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4371.9s)]
*  when everyone can get ready. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4373.74s)]
*  I'm like, isn't he even there? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4374.74s)]
*  It's a fake story. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4376.259999999999s)]
*  And then, but Covington was great. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4377.179999999999s)]
*  But the hotels are smaller because it's like a little town. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4379.46s)]
*  But we went to shoot there and people would come over [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4382.299999999999s)]
*  and knew me. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4385.46s)]
*  And so I thought, oh, I don't know if I can stay here [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4386.58s)]
*  because they'll just wait in the lobby. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4388.42s)]
*  So I stayed back in town. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4391.14s)]
*  At the Ritz. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4393.14s)]

*  And the guy goes, I wouldn't go to that one. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4396.740000000001s)]
*  I go, it's 20 feet away. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4398.22s)]
*  He goes, yeah, I wouldn't go to the right. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4399.42s)]
*  He goes, just go that way. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4401.3s)]
*  And I go, what's the right? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4403.22s)]
*  And he goes, do you wanna get gunned down? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4404.06s)]
*  I go, what the fuck? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4405.820000000001s)]
*  This is the Ritz. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4407.34s)]
*  They go, they don't put that in the brochure. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4408.18s)]
*  I go, yeah, no, they don't. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4409.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you want a McFuneral, dude? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4412.42s)]
*  Go find, get that bitch. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4414.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4415.660000000001s)]
*  So I always just walked out in fear. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4416.54s)]

*  It's called Nothing Personal. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4432.78s)]
*  That's a good title because it is nothing personal. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4434.7s)]
*  I make fun of people. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4438.82s)]
*  But you know what the truth is, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4440.339999999999s)]

*  So they shouldn't, right? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4448.02s)]
*  What if you just canceled yourself? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4449.14s)]
*  That's the best way to do it. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4450.42s)]
*  Oh, that's a good idea. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4451.38s)]

*  I think that's offensive. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4458.9s)]
*  And I think that's it for you. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4459.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4461.46s)]
*  And then I take myself out of it, you know? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4462.3s)]

*  David Spade, thanks so much, bro. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4469.38s)]
*  Yeah, man, let's do it again in a couple years. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4471.02s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4473.18s)]
*  Now I'm just floating on the breeze [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4474.5s)]
*  And I feel I'm falling like these leaves [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4477.1s)]
*  I must be cornerstone [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4480.06s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4485.26s)]
*  I'll share this peace of mind I found [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4488.02s)]
*  I can feel it in my bones [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4490.78s)]
*  But it's gonna take a little time [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4495.46s)]
*  For me to set that parking brake [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4501.46s)]
*  And let myself unwind [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4505.1s)]
*  Shine that light on me [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4507.34s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my stories [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4513.14s)]
*  Shine on me [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4518.14s)]
*  And I will find a song [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4522.62s)]
*  I will sing it just for you [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4525.62s)]
*  And I'll be moving way too fast [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4528.62s)]
*  On the runaway train with a heavy load of my past [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4536.42s)]
*  And these wheels that I've been riding on [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4544.3s)]
*  They're worn so thin that they're damn near gone [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4547.099999999999s)]
*  I guess now they just weren't built to last [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5vSdM47iY&t=4549.62s)]
