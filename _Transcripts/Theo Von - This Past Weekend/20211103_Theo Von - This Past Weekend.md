*  When I was young [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=561.8s)]
*  After Halloween had gone [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=562.8s)]

*  I don't have any face paint [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=574.8s)]
*  I remember we'd come home and just basically [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=577.8s)]
*  I remember, you know, sometimes we didn't plan ahead at my house [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=580.8s)]
*  And obviously nobody planned ahead if they had four children [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=586.8s)]
*  And, you know, when the dad was in his seventies [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=589.8s)]
*  There was very little planning goin' on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=592.8s)]
*  But as a child, we didn't, you know, we just [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=596.8s)]
*  So sometimes we'd get home for [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=599.8s)]
*  It would be the night of Halloween [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=601.8s)]
*  We'd get home and we didn't have anything [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=603.8s)]
*  No prep or tori [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=605.8s)]
*  You know, my mom had bought [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=607.8s)]
*  Raggedy Andy costumes one year [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=610.8s)]
*  So those bitches were going around, you know [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=613.8s)]
*  And then it was [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=616.8s)]
*  I remember we cut the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=618.8s)]
*  It was Raggedy Ann [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=620.8s)]
*  Those were the ones mom had bought or dad had bought [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=622.8s)]
*  And then we cut the hair on them bastards one time [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=624.8s)]
*  So we [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=627.8s)]
*  Next thing you know, you Raggedy Ann [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=628.8s)]
*  Now you Raggedy Andy [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=630.8s)]
*  We cut them bitches real [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=632.8s)]

*  You know this when I was young this is the time you'd see a lot of stray animals come through [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=774.8s)]
*  Because they'd be done partying for the summer done, you know out [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=780.8s)]

*  That new Colin Kaepernick show I [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1084.8s)]

*  Start real life trouble [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1096.8s)]

*  Race race [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1110.8s)]
*  Racism that was just it just felt like the lowest common denominator for racial pandering [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1114.8s)]
*  That's what it felt like and I felt like it takes away from real stuff that happens [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1121.8s)]
*  or real or instances [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1128.8s)]
*  That's what it felt like to me now. I'm also a white guy. I'm a white guy. I'm a white guy [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1132.8s)]
*  That's what it felt like to me now, I'm also a white guy saying this [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1137.8s)]
*  But it just uh, it just felt sad [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1142.8s)]
*  it just felt like you guys can do better and [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1147.8s)]
*  You could put your face on something better [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1152.8s)]
*  But that's you know, I'm a Polish Nicaraguan bad boy, I don't know every you know, I don't know anything [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1158.8s)]
*  So but that shit felt fucking cheap [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1166.8s)]
*  Kaepernick also in the news after comparing being an NFL athlete to being a slave. He was slammed after this they said [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1172.8s)]
*  Yeah, that seemed like a lot of a lot of difference a lot of difference [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1180.8s)]
*  Big difference [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1186.8s)]
*  Big difference been than being on the 49ers and being on the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1188.8s)]
*  Zaire [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1193.8s)]

*  I mean that's you guys travel in a way different class of travel that alone a lot different [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1199.8s)]
*  I think we all feel like slaves sometimes Colin when it comes to like our jobs and stuff [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=1208.8s)]

*  It's not all bad. Like your your show I think is amazing. I think it's like you're just doing good work. Oh [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2805.7999999999997s)]
*  Thank you man for saying that [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2814.0s)]
*  And I didn't mean to cut you off. I don't it's hard for me to hear [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2816.72s)]
*  Nice things about myself I [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2822.12s)]
*  Appreciate them though and it's selfish of me to not even let you say them, isn't it? Isn't that selfish? I [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2825.3199999999997s)]
*  Noticed that about myself. Somebody was saying something nice. I'll stop them. I [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2831.04s)]
*  Don't want to hear it man [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2835.44s)]
*  Not because I don't believe them not cuz I don't you know [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2838.04s)]
*  But I think sometimes at a core space inside of me I don't [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2841.7599999999998s)]
*  Want to hear you say something nice about me because it would conflict [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2846.96s)]
*  With what I've always felt about myself [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2852.2s)]
*  Which are not nice things [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2856.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying that as like a cry for help or anything like that I'm not saying that you know [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2860.16s)]
*  I'm just trying to share sometimes. I like to examine why I think and feel things. It's it's the only [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2867.16s)]
*  It's one of the ways I can use to feel differently [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2873.88s)]
*  so but when you said that it hit me a little and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2878.56s)]
*  Then I stopped I don't want I don't want to hear him say something nice [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2883.08s)]
*  Because if I hear him say something nice that I'm a think man [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2887.92s)]
*  What if that's true what if I actually am a good person [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2892.52s)]
*  That would go against all the bad wiring that I've had inside of myself since I was little [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2895.12s)]
*  That I'm not good. I'm not good enough. I'm not enough [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2900.12s)]
*  And I'm not sound like it's hard to talk about these things and not have people think [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2907.6s)]
*  That I'm like in some place like well like I'm not about to slit my I'm not in some desperation space [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2913.64s)]
*  But all my life I've felt like I'm not good enough I [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2921.56s)]
*  Think that's a common feeling for a lot of people [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2925.68s)]
*  And I didn't really notice until just then [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2931.2799999999997s)]
*  When I stopped I didn't want to hear you say something nice about me. I appreciate it. I [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2935.16s)]
*  Really do Ryan. It's nice you to listen [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2940.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's nice to hear you say something nice about me [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2944.04s)]
*  You know, it's nice to you to be in the park under the tree it's nice you to be on unemployment [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2949.56s)]
*  But [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2956.44s)]
*  But yeah, I just realized that when I stopped him I don't want to hear him say something nice about me and [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2960.44s)]
*  Then I realized man a lot of times I don't I have trouble hearing people say something nice about me and [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2966.32s)]
*  Then I realized because if I hear him say something if I let it sink in [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2973.64s)]
*  If I believe what they're saying [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2978.92s)]
*  Then that's gonna go against these little these things inside of myself that I that I've always thought I was no good [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2982.16s)]
*  Which are things that I learned at a very young age or whatever [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2992.08s)]
*  And which are things that have motivated me most of my life [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=2998.08s)]
*  So it'd be under so you know, so anyway, this is kind of a lot there but it's just interesting man that just kind of [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3002.0s)]
*  happened on your call, but uh [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3007.72s)]

*  But I think the truth is man the united states was an experiment from the beginning [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3834.42s)]
*  With a lot of different hands in it and [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3843.2200000000003s)]

*  People converge here and it's been a melting pot. We've called it [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3853.14s)]
*  a thing and we [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3857.22s)]
*  you know, we've called it a free nation we've called it many things but [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3858.74s)]
*  Honestly, it's been evolving since it began. I mean [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3864.5s)]
*  When it began there wasn't much free about it for some people [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3868.8199999999997s)]

*  And I think the same could be said for today [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3890.74s)]
*  I think the america that we see today [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3893.7799999999997s)]
*  Is completely different than the one we saw 10 years ago and that different from the one 20 years before it and so on [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3896.74s)]

*  Which is such a limited thing about [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w9Aj3Uc8q0&t=3949.86s)]
