*  10 years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=104.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=105.84s)]
*  Did my tour. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=106.84s)]
*  Did you? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=107.84s)]
*  Yeah, that was great. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=108.84s)]
*  And how do you get into mall copping? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=109.84s)]
*  Zero education, no goals in life. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=112.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=116.2s)]
*  No, it's just one of those things that kind of just happens. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=117.2s)]
*  I started off doing other security and then it just turns into like, hey, I need a job [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=121.36s)]
*  and a full-time job at that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  And mall security is usually one of those ones like, hey, man, can you breathe? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=130.28s)]
*  I'm like, yes, fully functional. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  And they're like, you're hired. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=137.0s)]
*  So that's how I got into it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=138.56s)]
*  Was your father in mall copping or was it a fan? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=141.48s)]
*  It's not a... [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  My dad was actually a bus driver. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, he was? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  That's cool, man. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  I've ridden on buses and I like it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the uniform, the fact of us wearing uniforms in the family, that's a thing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=154.48s)]
*  Not military, you know, bus drivers, security guards. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=155.48s)]
*  So you get a job at the mall, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=157.84s)]
*  So where's the first mall you clock in at? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=159.8s)]
*  The first one I ever did? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=162.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=164.24s)]
*  It was called Horton Plaza. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=165.24s)]
*  It was downtown San Diego, no longer there, rest in peace. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=166.24s)]
*  It was a three story mall, had the theater down there, had all the kids hung out there [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=170.44s)]
*  at the time because the buses went and connected all through there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=175.56s)]
*  Who told you to get a job as a mall cop? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=178.44s)]
*  Did you just... [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=179.88s)]
*  Myself, honestly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=180.88s)]
*  You did? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=181.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=182.88s)]
*  I wasn't into the whole labor thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=183.88s)]
*  I did the little side jobs, building swimming pools, just being out in the sun, stuff I [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=184.88s)]
*  didn't want to... [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=189.52s)]
*  What do you mean being out in the sun? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=190.52s)]
*  Like what, hitchhiking or whatever? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=191.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was a hard job. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=192.52s)]
*  No, just like labor, hard labor, digging and trenches and like I said, digging swimming [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=193.52s)]
*  pools and stuff. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=198.76s)]
*  I'm too fat for stuff like that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=200.12s)]
*  So when I got into the mall cop thing, it was kind of supposed to be a lazy job for [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  me and it definitely wasn't a lazy job for me because I still come from the era of chasing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  people down. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=210.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=211.62s)]
*  And that used to be fun. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=212.62s)]
*  What as a mall cop you mean? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  Well first of all, what is the training like? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh, here's the mall, here's the clock in. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  Like I said, you can still breathe, right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=225.48s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, okay, well you're fully functional, you know? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=227.24s)]
*  Training with that, it's just more like... [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=230.88s)]
*  But there's no like, you don't have to have a 40 time, you don't have to have like a... [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=231.88s)]
*  There's not like a physical requirements to be a mall cop. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=236.12s)]
*  No, they actually will give you a segue if you can't meet the physical requirements. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=240.64s)]
*  Yeah, like, oh, you can't walk that fast? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=244.64s)]
*  Well, here's some mobile wheels, you know? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=247.8s)]
*  Like, here you go. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=249.96s)]
*  That Paul Blart shit's real. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=250.96s)]
*  It's very much real. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=252.5s)]
*  Like a lot of people make fun of it and stuff. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=253.5s)]
*  Actually, those are for the mall cops who can't get physical. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=258.6s)]
*  And that's embarrassing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=259.6s)]
*  I've gotten on those things and actually chased people as a joke. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=260.6s)]
*  Like oh, they're stealing, like watch this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=264.08s)]
*  It's embarrassing for them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=266.68s)]
*  They're running through the mall and you're just like... [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=267.88s)]
*  Oh, exactly, that look right there. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=269.72s)]
*  Well segues are so ridiculous because every time you're talking to a guy on a segue, he's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=272.36s)]
*  like, all right, man, I'll see you guys later. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=276.52s)]
*  And then he just takes, he's just like fucking... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=278.16s)]
*  Or you get those real professional ones and do the full spin on you and they're just like... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=281.24s)]
*  Yeah, all that like... [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=285.64s)]
*  But the training wise, man, it's not much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=287.32s)]
*  So there's no training. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=290.34s)]
*  So there's no like... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=291.34s)]
*  But there's not like where there's boot camp or anything like that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=292.34s)]
*  Oh, no, no more. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=295.48s)]
*  No. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=296.48s)]
*  I think that was the 70s security guards. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=297.48s)]
*  I used to learn from those tough guys. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=298.9s)]
*  Did you? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=300.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=301.44s)]
*  Punch them in the face. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=302.44s)]
*  I'm like, we can do that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=303.44s)]
*  Like we're not cops. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=304.44s)]
*  I'm like... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=305.44s)]
*  When you find out as a security guard that you're not a cop and things change, you're [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=306.44s)]
*  like, oh, I can do some shit now. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=309.8s)]
*  But that was back in the day. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=312.96s)]
*  You just have to kind of watch them steal and run off out the mall. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  And you're like, hey... [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  But what do you mean when you watch them when you see them? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  Like late... [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=321.56s)]
*  OK, so as of like the past 10 years now, you know, everyone's got cell phones and a stick [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=322.56s)]
*  up their ass. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  So it's like, hey, I'm trying to steal from your store. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  Don't touch me. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=330.24s)]
*  So now some guy won a case, I don't know, however many years ago. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=331.46s)]
*  Now it's like you can't chase them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=334.74s)]
*  You can't touch them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  You just have to kind of monitor their stealing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Like, hey, man, put that Gucci belt in that pocket. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=339.88s)]
*  It's showing, you know? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=342.56s)]
*  Like you got to kind of escort them out the mall. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=344.16s)]
*  So what do you but you can't can you even what? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=345.72s)]
*  So what's your what do you just be like, stop fucker? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=347.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=350.76s)]
*  Can you even do that? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=351.76s)]
*  No, you can't even say that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=352.76s)]
*  You can say fucker. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=353.76s)]
*  You just say fucker. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=354.76s)]
*  Fucker. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=355.76s)]
*  You know, like you say stop. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=356.76s)]
*  They're like, hey, you can't tell me what to do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=357.76s)]
*  I identify as go, you know, shit, you know. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=358.76s)]
*  So there's no training. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=361.8s)]
*  No. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=362.8s)]
*  OK, OK, so there's no training. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=363.8s)]
*  Do you shadow anybody when you first start? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=365.42s)]
*  Yeah, you'll go in, you'll shadow a couple of the guys that have been there a while. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=367.44s)]
*  They'll show you what stores to stay away from, what stores are cool, more or less just [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=371.32s)]
*  doing the whole rounds. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=376.67999999999995s)]
*  A lot of time you would have some malls would make you like scan in every 10 minutes through [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  the place. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=382.2s)]
*  But then we just kind of figured out if you just took a picture and then went to the copy [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=383.2s)]
*  place and made copies of those and had a sheet, you can just sit in the office and scan those [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=387.52s)]
*  things if nobody's watching. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=391.44s)]
*  So soon as your shadow leaves, that was pretty much it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  Oh, so you're saying like a QR code? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=397.2s)]
*  Like at each place you'd have to scan as you're moving around the mall. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=398.2s)]
*  So every day you'd have to go and check in like, oh, I'm at the baby gap here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=401.12s)]
*  And then you just have to keep checking in as you go through the mall to make sure that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=405.44s)]
*  you've secured the whole place, stuff like that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=408.8s)]
*  Like I'm at Baby Gap, I'm at Bed Bath & Beyond, I'm at Rocco's Tacos or whatever, and just [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=410.96s)]
*  around the bend. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=416.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=417.44s)]
*  So we just take a picture of the barcode, send it to our email, put all the barcodes [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=418.44s)]
*  on a sheet, printed it, and then we had it in the office. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=422.2s)]
*  So you could just sit there and scan it every few minutes? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=425.2s)]
*  Yeah, we put like timers on our cell phones and stuff like, hey, how long do you think [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=427.72s)]
*  it would take us to get from here to here? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=430.92s)]
*  One guy was an idiot. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  He would scan them all in a row. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=434.04s)]
*  And one of the time our supervisor came in and was like, hey, Speedy, like, how are you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=436.76s)]
*  doing this? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=442.04s)]
*  And he's like, and we got caught a little bit, but yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=443.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=445.64000000000004s)]
*  That's a good hack, bro. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we had a lot of hacks at the mall. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=447.64s)]
*  Hey, Joel. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=449.6s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=450.6s)]
*  When you pull up, when you start, when you first start there, what are the, were there [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=451.6s)]
*  like old heads working there? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=455.56s)]
*  Like what are the different types of mall cops? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=456.8s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=458.6s)]
*  You got your you got your pant booters. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  We call them pant booters. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=462.48s)]
*  Those are the security guards who did not make it as a cop. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  Their uncle or their step uncle was a cop, so they wanted to be a cop. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=467.48s)]
*  So they come in, they got the whole vest on. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  Everything's tucked in nice. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=473.76000000000005s)]
*  They got their pants tucked into their boots. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=475.44s)]
*  You know, they're ready for combat. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's like, bro, it's a mall job, you know. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  So you got that guy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=481.44s)]
*  And I will tell everyone that you know that guy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=482.36s)]
*  We all work with that guy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  Then sometimes you get the little thug dudes that are just like hanging around just because [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=488.68s)]
*  they need a job. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's not, you know, I'm not being discriminative, but that's it's very true. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  We get a lot of little thug guys that do security. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=496.68s)]
*  It's great because they're the ones who usually bring the weed for us, you know. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=498.88s)]
*  So it's always like, fuck yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=501.88s)]
*  Love you guys. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=503.56s)]
*  So those guys are usually ones like, you know, and that's not a race. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=505.4s)]
*  That's just the little ghetto guys that always come. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't do their job shirts untucked. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=510.52s)]
*  They're like, eh, we just do the bare minimum. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=512.92s)]
*  You know, if someone's stealing, let us know. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=514.52s)]
*  Yeah, those guys always look like they're going to get some some girl pregnant. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=517.48s)]
*  Or they already have. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=521.68s)]
*  The girl from Cinnabon is usually pregnant. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=523.28s)]
*  Is she? Oh, yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=524.96s)]
*  It's in the oven, baby. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=526.72s)]
*  Hell, yeah. Both the bun and the two buns going at once. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=527.8s)]
*  Drizzle it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=531.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=532.8s)]
*  OK, so and so those are the main two types of cops. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=534.32s)]
*  You feel like the mall cops. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=536.68s)]
*  And then there's just the the average Joe. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=538.44s)]
*  Like I would have put myself in the average Joe category, like, you know, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=541.32s)]
*  just the dad who just needs a job. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=545.56s)]
*  But there's that guy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  There's the real Paul Blart kind of type, you know, like no girlfriend, no wife, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=549.52s)]
*  you know, lives at home with mom, can't wait to go play video games type guy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  You know, like almost like the guy that never left the mall in a way. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=558.1199999999999s)]
*  He grew up in the mall and was like, I'm going to get a job here. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=561.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, like never stay here. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=564.56s)]
*  Yeah. Malls are awesome. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=566.1199999999999s)]

*  Malls are awesome. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=569.28s)]
*  I remember in our we used to go to Slide L, Louisiana. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=570.28s)]
*  They had a mall there. Bring it up. See if it's there. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=573.4799999999999s)]
*  Just see some images of it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  And they said this is a North Shore Square Mall. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's the doors. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=581.04s)]

*  They let you camp right outside by the parking lot, like in the medians. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=584.28s)]
*  So we get dropped over there on Saturday. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=587.52s)]
*  We'd hang out at the mall and then we'd sleep in our tents. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=591.0s)]
*  And then Sunday we go back into the mall, dude. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=594.2399999999999s)]
*  And they had a church service in there, too. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=596.92s)]
*  And we could just go do it all right there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=598.7199999999999s)]

*  We start following him. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1315.0s)]
*  And they're like, just let him steal first. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1316.4s)]

*  Oh, you're watching him. Yeah. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1332.68s)]
*  From how far away, like, were you guys strategically located somewhere? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1333.96s)]
*  I actually took my shirt off because I just wore Dickies. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1337.76s)]
*  So I don't know if you guys know what Dickies are. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1340.8400000000001s)]

*  I see you coming. Did you come in from the back? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1375.8s)]
*  He actually saw me walk by. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1377.8799999999999s)]
*  Kind of gave me a nod. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1379.16s)]
*  And I was like because I gave him the look like, hey, man, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1380.0s)]

*  And how long have you been a mall cop at that point? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1399.08s)]
*  You got to apprehend this guy probably about three years and wow. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1400.84s)]
*  So I was just waiting. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1404.24s)]
*  It was my moment waiting to grab this fucking guy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1405.28s)]
*  Snatched him up. Hey, man, you're coming with me. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1407.4s)]
*  That's what you said. Hey, man. Yeah. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1409.8s)]
*  I was like, hey, man, you're coming with me. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1411.24s)]
*  The whole like the whole just nine, you know, you come with me, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1413.0s)]

*  And he's like, he just looked up. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1418.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, but you put him on the ground. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1420.16s)]
*  Yeah, I tripped him on his leg because we're backing up [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1422.68s)]
*  and he trying to lead forward. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1424.92s)]
*  And any type of movement you do away from me, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1426.48s)]
*  you're resisting. Yeah, we're fucking going down. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1428.56s)]
*  So as soon as I pulled him back and he went a little forward, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1431.3999999999999s)]
*  I just snatched his leg. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  We went down. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1435.12s)]
*  I think one of the bottles broke because it just starts [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1436.48s)]
*  smelling like fucking cologne badly. Guilty. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1438.12s)]
*  Yeah. It literally. Oh, shit. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1440.84s)]
*  It's because we were in the office writing them up and the cops were coming. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1443.1599999999999s)]
*  He just smelled like whatever cologne broke on him. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1446.6399999999999s)]
*  Everybody in there smelled. Yeah. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1449.6s)]
*  Yeah. But like aftershave or whatever. But it was [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1451.6s)]
*  literally one of my best moments as a mall cop, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1454.8s)]
*  just because I was like, I got him. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1457.68s)]
*  I saw that I saw the picture and within an hour there he was. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1459.72s)]
*  And I was like, my fucking golden goose, your mind. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1464.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? So it was good. I loved it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1466.68s)]
*  Did you know you didn't have to go prosecute? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1469.16s)]
*  You have to do a citizen's arrest. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1471.96s)]
*  You do a citizen's arrest. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1474.16s)]
*  You do all that. And you guys take him where? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1476.5600000000002s)]
*  You guys take him into the back room. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1478.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Do you have him wrapped up or tied up? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1480.8s)]
*  No, we just put a zip tie on his hand. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1482.64s)]
*  I had these big ass industrial zip ties. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1485.72s)]
*  We usually used to leave him on this hook. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1488.0s)]
*  We never used them. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1489.6s)]
*  We only used them if we brought somebody into the office that needed one. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1491.28s)]
*  So I was like, hey, man, stick your hands out. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1494.44s)]
*  And he's like, he looked at me like, oh, shit. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1495.72s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1498.28s)]
*  And I was like, are they too tight? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1499.76s)]
*  And he goes, no, I'm like, oh, and I zipped them a little bit more [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1500.72s)]
*  because I didn't want him. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1503.28s)]
*  You know, I was like, fuck them, you know. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1504.32s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy when you're asking if they're too tight. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1505.8s)]
*  It's obvious that, yeah, this is. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1507.9199999999998s)]
*  But he, you know, he's like a little tighter. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1510.76s)]
*  Won't you, you know, you felt some shame that day. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1512.48s)]
*  And I was like, I bet the clone bandit was mine. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1515.04s)]
*  We never saw him again, you know. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1517.56s)]
*  And do you then turn him over to the police? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1519.3999999999999s)]
*  What's that like? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1520.84s)]
*  That's that's the lame part. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1522.28s)]
*  You got to call them. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1524.3999999999999s)]
*  And it's like they're not rushing to come handle this, you know. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1525.84s)]
*  So nine times out of 10, you're sitting there with Bobby [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1528.92s)]
*  just shooting the shit for like two hours, you know, like, so, man, why do you steal? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1532.12s)]
*  And then by the time you've already, like, counseled him, you want to let him go. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1535.92s)]
*  I actually wanted to let him go. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1541.2s)]
*  But it was already in like we're already in motion. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1543.04s)]
*  Well, I was like, oh, you fucked up, you know, like I already had to fuck you up. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1545.32s)]
*  And now the cops are coming. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1548.36s)]
*  The first 10 minutes was like, they're coming to get you, man. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1550.24s)]
*  You're so fucked. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1552.56s)]
*  You know, 20 minutes in is like, are you thirsty, man? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1554.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, so about literally cops took about two hours to get there. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1556.76s)]
*  And by the time they got there, they're like, all right, so what's going on? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1560.6s)]
*  It's like, oh, this guy was stealing Bob. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1563.8s)]
*  Why he's the clone bandit? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1565.24s)]
*  You know, we got he's like, OK, so come with us. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  And then that was it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1569.6399999999999s)]
*  It was like there was no fireworks at the end of this show. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1570.44s)]
*  You know, it was it was pretty. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1572.96s)]
*  That's why I said it's pretty lame when you call them to come take them away, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1575.44s)]
*  because it's like you want them to drag them out and beat the shit out of them, too. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1577.88s)]
*  You know, just give them a little extra. Fuck them. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=1582.32s)]

*  It was real emephors. Hot Topic was it. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3019.2s)]
*  Yeah, man, I loved Hot Topic. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3021.88s)]

*  Well, there is something weird. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3881.56s)]

*  It's fun to just do a little bit of fucking or whatever. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3921.8799999999997s)]

*  I've always said that. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3928.52s)]
*  And anyway, it was just that was awesome. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3929.4399999999996s)]
*  I miss her a lot sometimes and, you know, what else? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3933.0s)]

*  What? Doing sex in cars? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3947.8s)]
*  We caught somebody behind the trash can of the dumpsters one time. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3951.08s)]
*  Like they coordinated to go take out trash together because the guy told me, goes, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3953.92s)]
*  Yeah, I told her to take out trash at like eight thirty and we met. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3957.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's Romeo and Juliet. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3960.56s)]
*  Fuck yeah. And the gross thing is like it was the food court trash can. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3961.72s)]
*  So it's more like food and you couldn't use the one that uses plastic and cardboard. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3966.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's Recyclio and Juliet, dude. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3970.68s)]

*  It's hard for me to stay erect if there's broken glass around [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3979.24s)]
*  or like a bad trash smell is rough, you know, the smell of other pee [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3983.0s)]
*  kind of throws it off, too. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=3987.7599999999998s)]

*  Yeah. Like back in the day, I feel like if you needed a Wigger [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4012.7599999999998s)]
*  or you needed a ginger, you went to footlocker or lids. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4015.4399999999996s)]
*  I feel like that's where they kind of that was like their junior college. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4020.4s)]
*  This guy's called out my whole life right now. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4023.1600000000003s)]
*  I love lids. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4025.92s)]
*  Lids is a definite place for you to roll up [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4027.28s)]
*  and see what was kind of Wiggering around the area. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4031.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, yeah. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4034.6400000000003s)]

*  It was great. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4038.0400000000004s)]
*  And those were the ones that. Yeah. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4039.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. That's where God kept most of the Wiggers, I feel like, was footlocker [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4040.84s)]
*  and lids, dude. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4044.92s)]
*  Oh, one hundred percent. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4047.0s)]
*  One hundred percent. And JCPenney's. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4048.0s)]
*  They hid out in JCPenney's. Really? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4049.68s)]
*  Yeah, because that's where all like some urban clothes were at, you know? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4051.12s)]
*  Yeah. So they would get them on sale. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4054.56s)]
*  They knew where the sales were. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4056.08s)]
*  Um, what happened as malls started to decline, man? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4058.04s)]
*  Did you notice any of that in your time? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4062.6s)]
*  Yeah, you could definitely tell, like over one summer, about 10 years, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4064.04s)]
*  15 years ago, it was just like not packed anymore. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4068.08s)]
*  Wasn't fun anymore. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4071.2s)]
*  They still had the big movie blockbusters coming out, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4073.52s)]
*  but people weren't lining up to see Spider-Man no more. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4075.84s)]
*  You know, like once you see the theater die out, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4078.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that's when the mall is done. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4082.1600000000003s)]
*  Once the theater starts going and you can't draw anybody in there [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4084.08s)]
*  because that's theater has always been like the hub of why you go to it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4087.2400000000002s)]
*  Like the mall sometimes, you know, like, what are you going there for? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4090.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm going to movies, you know? Right. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4092.88s)]
*  But as soon as that decline started, it just. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4094.6800000000003s)]
*  You can see it. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4099.08s)]
*  And it's sad when you see like empty stores in the mall, you know, like, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4099.72s)]
*  oh, man, I used to go there. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4102.72s)]
*  And it's like, well, it's not there anymore. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4103.64s)]
*  It's like put something in there and they'll put like a phone store in there. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4104.88s)]
*  Are they just? Yeah. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4108.68s)]
*  Now Apple's like 20 stores deep and you're like cares, you know? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4109.8s)]
*  Yeah. Or it'll be like Kumal's magic shop or something. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4113.52s)]
*  And it's like, fuck it. Fuck, Tommy. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4116.72s)]
*  I'm not going if. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4119.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. If someone's dropping you out at the mall to learn magic, dude, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4120.72s)]
*  you are being sex traffic, dude. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4124.24s)]
*  Yeah. You're being set up for something. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4127.56s)]
*  I mean, that's easy. Right, guys? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4129.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4132.24s)]
*  But what about during the holidays? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4135.2s)]

*  Because I guess they're allowed to try on the panties and they put a little panty [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4531.5199999999995s)]

*  it's not like they go throw them in a washing machine. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4543.4s)]
*  They just put them back on the rack. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4545.2s)]
*  So I guess the guy caught on to where they were putting those panties [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4547.4s)]
*  and he would go by and just kind of, oh, yeah, these look good. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4551.12s)]

*  Like, how do you what do you say there? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4574.44s)]
*  I actually used my own words. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4577.08s)]
*  I said, hey, man, what the fuck are you doing in here sniffing underwear like that? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4579.32s)]
*  And he's like, I'm not. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4582.879999999999s)]
*  I'm like, bro, you are in your sniffing panties like a fucking pervert. Why? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4584.08s)]
*  He's like, and he started walking away. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4587.92s)]
*  I said, hey, bro, don't come in here no more. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4589.72s)]
*  Stop grabbing handfuls of panties and sniffing them. We see you. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4592.88s)]
*  Yeah. And then he walks out. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4596.280000000001s)]
*  And I I swear he said this under his breath. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4598.320000000001s)]
*  He goes, I'm still going to do it. Really? Yeah. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4600.76s)]
*  I was like, oh, he's dedicated. Yeah. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4603.64s)]
*  You got to respect that, man. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4605.400000000001s)]
*  But he was definitely one of the only ones that I actually encountered. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4606.6s)]
*  I've heard plenty of stories like there is there. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4609.8s)]
*  Victoria Seagrows used to tell stories all the time about like, oh, man, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4612.52s)]
*  this guy used to do like a run by sniff or girls would like [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4615.2s)]
*  if they pull up their panties or they would hold panties in the air [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4620.16s)]
*  to look at him or something. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4622.360000000001s)]
*  A guy would like drop his wallet or something, you know, a quick little sniff by. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4623.360000000001s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, we see a lot of that here. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4627.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, why don't you say anything like sometimes it's funny. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4629.12s)]
*  Sometimes it's really pervy. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4632.72s)]
*  I'm like, it's all pervy. It's all pervy. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4634.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I guess it could be funny if you just see somebody [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4637.04s)]
*  hit a knee and a sniff. Yeah. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4639.56s)]
*  And what would they do is try to sniff, sniff, smell the woman. The butt. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4641.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. That'll get you. Sniffers are weird. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4645.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's, you know, humans are 40 percent animal or something. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4648.5599999999995s)]
*  And they do it, you know. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4653.04s)]
*  So I don't think it's crazy. No. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4655.76s)]
*  But it's a yeah, it's an art for it. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4658.4s)]
*  I don't know if it's an art form. That's crazy. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4661.68s)]
*  But yeah, it seems weird. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4662.92s)]
*  I think it's it should have been something back in the day that got frowned upon. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4664.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, hey, you can't be sniffing Sally's ass. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4668.08s)]
*  It's like, whatever. Yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4669.6s)]
*  Have you ever had to protect like a mall center or anything like that? Yes. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4672.6s)]
*  Or what's it like when the mall Santa's come? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4675.56s)]
*  Take me through some Christmas time, Lord. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4677.240000000001s)]
*  OK, so the mall Santa situation is always a fun one because. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4679.0s)]
*  Eight out of 10 times. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4684.72s)]
*  He's a drunk. Really? Oh, yeah. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4687.080000000001s)]

*  He was in the game, I think, 26 years. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4785.44s)]
*  He did mall Santa stuff. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4788.88s)]
*  He was standing. He done all types. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4790.24s)]

*  Anybody ever any issues with mall Santa's or anything? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4802.12s)]
*  One one one Santa had to get fired his third day. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4804.96s)]
*  And I think because he fought a parent [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4808.12s)]
*  because the kid asked for something and the parent was going like this, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4811.4400000000005s)]
*  trying to tell him, tell Santa like, tell him, no, tell him, no. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4815.76s)]
*  It's like Santa's not allowed to say no. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4818.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4820.72s)]
*  Well, the kid was just asking for like toys, like basic toys. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4821.72s)]
*  But I guess the kid was a bad kid. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4825.04s)]
*  And this was supposed to be a lesson to the kid. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4826.92s)]
*  But the parent didn't let us in on the fucking on the jam. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4828.6s)]
*  So the kid starts telling Santa like, hey, you know, I want this toy, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4832.2s)]
*  this toy, this toy. He's like, oh, yeah, this that. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4836.72s)]
*  And she's like, no, no. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4838.72s)]
*  Like you can see him kind of like. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4840.8s)]
*  OK, so he keeps going on. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4843.320000000001s)]
*  Then the dad walks up and he starts still telling the story. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4844.92s)]
*  Are telling what toys he wants. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4848.4s)]
*  And the Santa starts just eyeballing the deck because now the dad's like [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4850.32s)]
*  doing this. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4855.04s)]

*  It literally a transformer. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4872.759999999999s)]
*  He went from Santa to whatever his name and because he's [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4874.5599999999995s)]
*  stood up and literally as he stood up the beard, the hat and everything [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4878.4s)]
*  just kind of came off the whole top. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4882.759999999999s)]
*  He's like, what? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4884.599999999999s)]
*  And they just started fighting right there on the spot. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4885.4s)]
*  He's like, he started. Santa started hitting him. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4887.679999999999s)]
*  I kind of stepped in the middle, pushed the mom back because the mom [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4890.16s)]
*  started clawing at us. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4893.679999999999s)]
*  And then the kids like he the kid literally standing there going, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4895.12s)]
*  what did I he he yelled out, what are they getting a bite? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4898.48s)]
*  I just want to know. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4902.44s)]
*  You know, but he literally yelled out, what did I do wrong? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4904.2s)]
*  I'm like, oh, man, you like in my head, you didn't do nothing wrong. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4906.64s)]
*  It's your fucking parents, you know? Yeah. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4909.76s)]
*  But I and later on, and the cops came, the parents were explaining that [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4911.56s)]
*  we're trying to teach him a lesson. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4915.52s)]
*  We brought him here because we want to talk to Santa and all this shit. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4917.160000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, well, you end up getting your ass whooped. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4919.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So what's the lesson here? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4921.64s)]
*  Yeah, you shouldn't. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4924.0s)]
*  You can't attack Santa because he has met because he's the best. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4924.8s)]
*  That's why. Yeah. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4927.84s)]
*  And you don't know who's under that Santa, you know? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4929.04s)]
*  No. No. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4931.64s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4933.72s)]
*  Any would you hit on women at the mall? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4936.8s)]
*  Because it's probably hard. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4938.8s)]
*  Here's what I would guess would be tough. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4939.76s)]
*  A woman shows up at the mall, attractive, you feel attracted to her. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4941.92s)]
*  But then how do you not just chase her like not chase her on? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4946.56s)]
*  But you know, I'm saying a mall is just people are going in a certain direction. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4949.84s)]
*  If you know, because even I remember when I was young and I'll be at the mall, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4952.68s)]
*  you'd kind of be following the girl around the mall. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4956.68s)]
*  Mall stocking, mall stocking is real. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4958.52s)]
*  Is that what it's called? Mall stocking, mall stocking. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4960.56s)]
*  And as a mall cop, you can definitely get away with it [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4962.200000000001s)]
*  more than just being an average Joe. Yeah. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4965.16s)]
*  You know, because if you're like just following a girl in normal clothes, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4966.96s)]
*  you're like, what's going on? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4969.16s)]
*  But no, we used to mall stock back in our days. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4970.599999999999s)]
*  You know, girls would show up and it'd be nice to because like [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4973.24s)]
*  it's kind of weird because we had our own little groupies [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4977.04s)]
*  because they think we like, oh, man, he's a security guard. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4979.68s)]
*  He can get us backstage. Like to what? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4981.92s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4983.88s)]
*  The best we can do is probably sneak into the theater, you know? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4984.76s)]
*  And that right there was money back in the day. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4987.8s)]
*  Girls loved us for that. Really? Yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4990.5599999999995s)]
*  Because it was it was a kind of a scam [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4992.6s)]
*  because I would walk the girl up to the movie theater [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4995.56s)]
*  and I would know half the people anyway. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4997.72s)]
*  But most of the time I'd walk up and like, hey, she left her purse in the theater. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=4999.360000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to walk her in and make sure she gets out. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5003.64s)]
*  And they're like, OK, guys, you're all right. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5005.280000000001s)]
*  I'm like, so what movie would you like to see? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5007.200000000001s)]
*  Easy numbers, man, easy numbers. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5010.4400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, mall cops actually had their own little groupies around. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5012.280000000001s)]
*  It was great. Ever get laid from a woman you met at the mall? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5015.240000000001s)]
*  No. Yeah. Really? No. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5017.88s)]
*  No, I never pursued. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5020.4800000000005s)]
*  Too much like I never pursued the clientele. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5023.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5026.68s)]
*  Just because you never knew where that was going to land. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5027.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5029.320000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you see like an attractive woman [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5030.240000000001s)]
*  and they're just shopping at the wrong store and you're like, oh, yeah. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5031.88s)]
*  Good on that. You know, sometimes I just fucked everything up. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5035.68s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, so do mall cops have enemies? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5038.96s)]
*  Do you guys have other mall cops? Really? Yeah. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5042.400000000001s)]
*  Other mall cops. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5045.96s)]
*  So there would be beef on the force. Yeah. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5047.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5049.76s)]
*  If you have so say you have mall cops heart, say you have mall cops that [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5051.96s)]

*  An attempted kidnapping happened on my day off. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5138.88s)]
*  We all heard about it. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5142.48s)]

*  Have you met my son? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5160.96s)]

*  and went to walk towards and the mom's like, Hey, where are you going? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5177.5199999999995s)]

*  And that's the truth. He was literally sitting in a toy store. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5236.84s)]
*  And when I found him, he was sitting there playing with a toy. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5239.16s)]
*  And I say, Hey, his name was Jacob. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5241.8s)]
*  I was like, Hey, are you Jacob? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5243.72s)]

*  No. Wow. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5255.36s)]
*  So that's got to be kind of is it scary or does it just get so repetitive [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5257.0s)]
*  that you're like, oh, this is probably the same thing, you know, still scared. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5259.96s)]

*  And so it always sinks in like don't want to lose your kid. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5267.44s)]
*  Then you always want to slap him in the back of the fucking head like this. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5271.4s)]
*  And then you're like, I'm not going to lose my kid. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5274.0s)]

*  It's just so crowded. You did not pay attention. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5291.8s)]
*  And you have to do an intercom thing then or no? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5294.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. What do you do? What do you what do you say? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5296.6s)]

*  What were the best things about being a mall cop? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5673.0s)]
*  The leniency of not having like a boss hanging over your head [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5676.099999999999s)]
*  sometimes because with having the badge, you were able to go places [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5679.7s)]
*  and nobody would fucking question you. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5684.2s)]
*  And flat out, I'm a pothead. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5685.5s)]

*  so long is because I had so many hiding places. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5693.4s)]
*  I had so many like resources for free food. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5695.799999999999s)]
*  People watching was great. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5699.7s)]
*  You know, it was just like those small things. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5700.9s)]
*  But the majority of it was just not having somebody breathing down your [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5703.0s)]
*  neck 24 7 because you were like your own boss, you know, a lot of mall [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5705.9s)]

*  You'd only be like one or two guys, you know, four at the most. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5711.4s)]
*  If it was like a busy mall, it's like one or two guys and the one guy [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5714.799999999999s)]
*  that's walking around in the platoon or whatever. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkfQ3fivwF8&t=5718.0s)]
