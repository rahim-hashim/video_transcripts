*  The dilemma lately man, um on the road a lot and uh, sometimes I gotta you know, uh, take care of business but uh, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1709.22s)]
*  I I just I don't enjoy pooping in public places. So, um, you know, I just wanted to get your thoughts on uh, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1718.26s)]
*  You know the home court advantage [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1725.78s)]
*  Versus in the way game, you know if anyone else is having that issue [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1728.74s)]
*  Uh [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1733.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, brother. Look, thank you for calling man, and i'm sorry you're even having to do it [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1734.1000000000001s)]
*  You know your body can only hold so much food before it gives up [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1739.22s)]
*  And it has to do a bm [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1744.98s)]
*  And there's nothing you're not doing anything wrong or anything. You're not a bad guy [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1748.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, you're not a you know, you're not a um [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1752.26s)]
*  You know a little wuss or whatever your neighbor called you nothing like that [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1755.46s)]
*  You're a regular guy and you've just had too much food over a certain period of time [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1759.22s)]
*  um [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1764.82s)]
*  And yeah, I think one of the major issues is back in the day men would they worked close to where they lived [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1767.3s)]
*  You know a man worked at the bank and he lived four blocks from the bank [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1773.86s)]
*  You know and that you know, that's a close amount that's a shitter's distance they used to call it [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1778.74s)]
*  So a man could go and do a bm at home [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1784.26s)]
*  Or uh, there's sometimes a man would even have a camper and they do it in a camper [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1787.6200000000001s)]
*  But now yeah, you're you know, or you know, so people worked near where they defecated [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1794.26s)]
*  And so now though you have been flying around the world and traveling and being uh, you know [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1801.5400000000002s)]
*  You fly across the world and sell cement to somebody [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1806.1000000000001s)]
*  You know and are you you know you do you you know you drive down the damn um [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1811.38s)]
*  uh [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1815.94s)]
*  you'll drive over there to uh [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1817.7s)]
*  to um boysie and sell them some cabinets or something and you you're crapping the whole way there and back [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1820.26s)]
*  Crapping in other people's lands and other people's territories [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1828.34s)]
*  And yeah, and your body gets nervous when you get further from home, too [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1833.3799999999999s)]
*  You know it used to be there's like an old [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1838.1s)]
*  Wives tale if you read a lot of like, uh native american literature or about some of their habits [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1841.06s)]
*  If they walked too far if they had to do a bm it would be their body telling them nerves would do that [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1848.8999999999999s)]
*  So they would even defecate around an area and then come back just to if they went near there again the scent would warn them [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1856.6599999999999s)]
*  uh [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1864.82s)]
*  This is an uncomfortable territory [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1865.9399999999998s)]
*  So there's a lot of stuff built into that man, i'm sorry you're dealing with it and um [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1868.74s)]
*  And you know i'm the kind of guy I I will usually kind of plan ahead [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1875.54s)]
*  And that's what I think you should do bud get you a little timer or put a little [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1880.3400000000001s)]

*  She would beat on the door and ask me if I was doing a bm or not [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1894.9s)]
*  And I just think that's just the that's just insane to ask just you know [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1900.1000000000001s)]
*  Dude i'll tell you uh, I got this crazy story. So I was in [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1906.42s)]
*  Seattle one night and I [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1910.26s)]
*  I ran into the bathroom and there's a guy working in there right? There's a brother in there in the bathroom [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfP7V-l406M&t=1912.9s)]
