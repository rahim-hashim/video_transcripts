*  Really nice stuff. I think it makes me feel uncomfortable [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=146.1s)]
*  No, I mean not sorry. Not when we went to UFC [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=149.38s)]

*  Yeah, I think I'm trying yeah, I don't like I just don't like trying stuff on I know certain t-shirts [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  I know how they're gonna fit. I'm very basic with that kind of stuff, you know [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, dude, that looks like a very I'm trying to think that's like a Native American [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=177.4s)]
*  sort of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=182.04000000000002s)]

*  Yeah, I'm sure I just hope it's okay to wear with a cheese store hat [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=207.16s)]
*  Those two have never been together before [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=212.92s)]
*  Well, it's sad that we took over the Americans land to build a cheese store, too [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=215.95999999999998s)]

*  Oh if you get a comfortable Brie [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=226.28s)]
*  It's like sometimes you you want to swallow but you want it to stay in your mouth and breeze basically like butter [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=228.35999999999999s)]

*  It's cream on the inside clean on the outside [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=252.16s)]
*  I'm gonna take what I'm looking at right now [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=255.12s)]
*  It doesn't like cake and it's a very very freeing feeling to spread some good breathe knowing how good it's gonna be [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=256.84s)]

*  Shout out to my guy Josh our producer Josh you met nice little fellow [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=372.36s)]

*  Jam on a table at breakfast [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=381.68s)]
*  I'm starting to put that on the bread on the toast which is actually fantastic [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=383.08s)]
*  And there's some great jams on charcuterie boards [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  And I've been loving the jam with the crackers and the cheese it's oddly a good creamy sweet [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  Scenario so the jam has been my favorite part and obviously you can't get the meat from 7-eleven [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=394.24s)]
*  I've been spoiled at the cheese store because they do bring out like stuff from Italy which is obviously creme de la creme [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=399.12s)]
*  But that's a place in LA that you yeah, yeah, and he's if I was gonna go you'd offer to take me [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=404.44s)]

*  Okay, so the jams there's definitely I do notice a lot of times you'll see the jam on there that has like um [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=411.08s)]
*  The seeds in it yeah, and that to me. It's just like I've never really liked like really rich stuff [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  You know like I remember one time we went to my my dad had a girlfriend [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  Sorry mom [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=430.0s)]
*  My dad had a girlfriend and we went over and she was rich dude like she had a balcony [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=431.56s)]

*  She was doing Thanksgiving and she had like cranberries, but it was like real bear like [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  You know I've talked about this years ago, but there was like there's different grades of cranberries [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  You can get like the gel at the jelly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=451.04s)]
*  It's basically somebody just opened up a smuckers cut it into slices [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=453.36s)]
*  And you eat it like that like our mom would do that sometimes she would put the jelly into the freezer for like an hour [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=457.0s)]
*  and a half [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=462.3s)]

*  We're all yeah, I will die for relish. I'll eat relish bag [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=978.8s)]
*  I could eat relish by itself like I don't do it, but I could I will love relish [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=982.4s)]
*  Fantastic hot dog mustard relish boom easy. Love it [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=985.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=989.66s)]
*  One thing I do like about a hot dog time is I will do a hot dog, right? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=990.06s)]
*  Some people will do like they'll DP a hot dog to put like two Franks in it or whatever [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=994.56s)]
*  I don't do that. Have you ever done Chicago hot dog? It's my favorite type of hot dog. Oh, yeah [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=998.76s)]
*  I was at the Chicago [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1004.64s)]
*  Cubs game. Yeah [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1006.64s)]
*  Vanna beef dog. I think they gave us some up there is very nice. Yes. Yes [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1008.88s)]
*  You go on the poppy seed bun sport peppers mustard relish tomato slice pickle. It's the best. That's a pickle [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1012.76s)]
*  I like but I don't know Chicago hot dog. They literally put the whole pickle spear on it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1020.16s)]
*  So it's kind of hard to eat. I will say they should put pickle slices on it [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1023.52s)]
*  But everything together in there is one of my favorite bites in the world. I love a Chicago hot dog [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1026.24s)]
*  Mmm, and do they use a special type of bun for that? They do usually it's a poppy seed bun [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1030.08s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I think that's the traditional way [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1034.76s)]
*  I do enjoy like a split top bun split top bun is nice. I mean, yeah, I'm a big I'm I'm very high on Chicago [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1036.4s)]
*  I think it's the best food city in the country. Oh, yeah, I would watch you eat that man. That looks cool [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1043.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know, right one time for Chicago at the same time. We'll share it [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1047.44s)]
*  Yeah, I used to watch those videos of Japanese women eating big pieces of cake or whatever. You ever seen that? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1052.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm a mukbang. Yeah, but it's before mukbang and it was just like when people it was like, you know [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1056.96s)]
*  Cuz Japanese people are like the human ASMR, right? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1062.0s)]
*  Sure, if you ever just been around a Japanese person, it's like listening to ASMR [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1064.92s)]
*  But they're like in the room with you and they're just being themselves, right? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1069.8s)]
*  They're not even like if a Japanese person whispers in the woods who the fuck would ever know dude [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1072.3600000000001s)]
*  Can't even hear them, you know, so it's like they're just so quiet. It's like [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  shit, I know what I was talking about, but um [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1084.2s)]
*  Yeah, anyway, what were you talking about? We were talking about some Chicago hot dogs [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  Speaking of food we shared a great steak Friday night [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1091.7s)]
*  Oh, we did I felt really bad though because I could tell when the waiter asked me what I liked how I liked to cook [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1094.6200000000001s)]
*  Then I said medium rare there was so much disappointment on your face and you wanted medium and I felt really bad about it since then [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1099.74s)]
*  So I just wanted to apologize for that. Oh, well, thanks, dude [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1104.22s)]
*  well, I've been trying to do this thing where if somebody makes a suggestion I go along with it instead of always just [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1106.9s)]
*  You know, I'm usually like like if somebody wants to go see a movie if I don't want to see it [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1112.82s)]
*  Nah always right never like don't you want to come out? No, do not [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1117.32s)]
*  So this was like something practicing for me like somebody's like hey, let's have a steak [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1123.0s)]
*  This is how I like it and I was like, I hate I don't want that but tried it [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1127.12s)]
*  Loved it was a fence. It was that was one of the better steaks. I've had out in a long time [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1133.0s)]
*  I agree was really really where were we at? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1136.8s)]
*  It was I think it was called Don's Prime Don's found blue in Vegas. It was one of the better steaks [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1138.68s)]
*  I've had in a long time [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1144.16s)]
*  Yeah, I agree and I'll say what even made it good. I think for me, let's tell each other what wait what they thought [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1146.04s)]
*  Made it good for me. It wasn't [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1151.32s)]
*  Overwhelmed with like seasoning and too much juice like [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1155.52s)]
*  Too juicy like sometimes juices. It's nice, but it was just kind of perfect [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1160.0s)]
*  It didn't like get the plate all blood. It was just kind of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1165.24s)]
*  Perfectly like hey, it almost like it showed up and was like hey, I know [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1169.44s)]
*  I'm fucking the shit. Yeah, cuz they kept telling us they assumed we sat down [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1174.68s)]
*  They said oh, this is from some sick farm in Idaho [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1179.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is good meat and we all said oh that's the one we're getting and it made me happy to see because like there's so [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1181.8400000000001s)]
*  Many times I'm sitting around with these restaurants and you hear about all these details about the meat and it comes in [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1187.3200000000002s)]
*  It's whatever that you could taste the difference. That was really one of the better better steaks. I've ever had [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1191.88s)]
*  Oh, I agree man. It was great and we split up [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1195.76s)]
*  It was the perfect amount ever still gonna go out for a bit [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1197.52s)]
*  We weren't too weighed down like leaning on the speaker in the corner of the bar [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1199.8799999999999s)]
*  Dude one thing on what they're always like, yeah this calf it was like tickled by tall kids or whatever you're like, well [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1205.24s)]
*  Yeah, the Japanese the way I go they're going through everything [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1212.4399999999998s)]
*  They're eating good there like they're feeding them just grass fetish [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1216.1999999999998s)]
*  They're just eating grass all their lives [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1218.72s)]
*  But um, they're like Japanese people whispered directly into the skin of this animal while it was being raised, you know, it's like [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1220.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like raised in a two-bedroom apartment like holy shit some of this meat sounds very fancy [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1227.24s)]
*  But yeah, it's like it's so scary to also to think about I always do this too many times [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1234.16s)]
*  Like to think about truly how many animals there are if all this food is being given to people [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1238.92s)]
*  It's so scary. What are you saying? Like how many like chickens are murdered not murdered but killed a day like so many [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1245.44s)]
*  I'm just trying to think about this reason like if I order [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1251.96s)]
*  An order of wings at a bar and there's ten wings in there. Does that technically mean that I'm having five chickens [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1255.0s)]
*  Like two wings of chicken. I think there are some chickens that have more than two [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1260.44s)]
*  206 million a day [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1264.92s)]
*  Globally are probably 206 million chickens are killed for food each day. It's a wild set [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1266.8400000000001s)]
*  Wiles that holy shit, dude, it's like since we started talking about this 140,000 chickens just died. Oh [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1272.48s)]
*  That's wild that's the original Gaza right there dude, that's crazy [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1279.04s)]
*  I can't believe they're doing that in the United States alone. The numbers around 26 million chickens [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1283.48s)]
*  That means that roughly 140,000 chickens are slaughtered every minute. But hold on [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1289.52s)]
*  How many people live in America? I think it's 350 million. I think that sounds right. It's around there [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1293.92s)]
*  I think so you're saying yeah 340 340 million 26 million chickens a day. Mm-hmm [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1298.2s)]
*  so it means one out of [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1305.3999999999999s)]
*  Trying to do this math. I'm not very good at math. It's like one out of 13 maybe 14 [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1308.2s)]
*  I don't know. I think 340 divided by 26 is [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1312.76s)]
*  Around we were right. Well Wow [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1317.84s)]
*  So one out of 13 people every day is having a chicken [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1321.1599999999999s)]
*  Which seems kind of low. I [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1324.12s)]
*  Thought it seemed right on time [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1326.12s)]
*  Really? Yeah [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1328.12s)]
*  Cuz I think children don't need a lot of chicken because they're so little and they can't and you shouldn't give expensive food to children [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1329.44s)]
*  I had chicken today. Yeah, I had a chicken already had it. Yeah, I had a I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich from pop belly today [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1335.56s)]
*  Right before I came I need something in the system [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1341.52s)]
*  You want to happen to me yesterday that I'm actually really disappointed about yeah [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1343.28s)]
*  And I hope that whoever did this sees this podcast and come catch me outside [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1346.28s)]
*  But yesterday I was out meeting my parents did one of those party buses. Mm-hmm [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1350.4s)]

*  Did it sound like he set it down completely and left it or could you hear any more like he might have he might have been? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1455.28s)]
*  The guy to come good. I hope he wasn't the guy to do it because that would that would be bad [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1460.44s)]
*  That would be tough for door dash. I love door dash. But um, oh, yeah [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1464.1200000000001s)]
*  They're the fucking Navy Seals of our generation of door to roll [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1467.52s)]
*  I mean Tim Dylan and I had a big conversation about this to roll up [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1470.84s)]
*  Silently to a door as quietly as you can leave something completely fucking delectable, right evade dogs evade [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1474.36s)]
*  Dangerous brothers probably trying to rob you like all types of shit, you know evade hungry people [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1482.28s)]
*  That's my biggest pet peeve about nice hotels [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1488.24s)]
*  And when you stay in a nice hotel [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1490.1999999999998s)]
*  The door dashers can't get up to you because of the keep because of the key like this past weekend [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1491.32s)]
*  We were saying at a nice hotel in Vegas. They can't get up to you [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1495.36s)]
*  So you have to go down you have to go down pick up the food but not a decent hotel like a Cambria [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1498.28s)]
*  They can walk right up. There's no security [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1503.28s)]
*  I didn't have to go down to the lobby or anything and I run to the door and I open it into my underwear [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1507.4s)]
*  Make sure no one's around grab it. Yeah [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1511.64s)]
*  We try to lean just get your hold the door open and try to grab it off the ground [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1514.08s)]
*  Dude, go tell rooms are crazy. How much you're just hiding from everybody [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1519.88s)]
*  Interesting experience to think about I was talking about this with our producer Kelsey recently to about just how much on a conversation [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1524.48s)]
*  Love Kelsey just how much um, like sex do you think has been in every hotel room you've been in like in Vegas, especially? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1530.6s)]
*  Oh, I can't even imagine how many people have even just you're off on the floor in my room [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1537.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if a hotel has been if a hotel has been over for 20 years [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1544.06s)]
*  It's had like I want to have each how much each room has seen scary to think about because there's no way it's being properly sterile [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1546.6799999999998s)]
*  No way do you I don't know if you how you could properly sterilize it unless you use like eco shield or one of those companies [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1553.12s)]
*  That comes and does the um [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1558.98s)]
*  You know, I mean you'd have to use some type of a high-grade cleaner [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1560.68s)]
*  What would you do pressure wash the carpet or whatever truly? No idea that the point [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1565.18s)]
*  They always say no, uh, you should have bigger black light into a hotel because you know, what's on the walls? Yeah, right? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1569.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's that's weird for me. And also my hotel is very it's a very odd hotel [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1573.14s)]
*  It's the only hotel I got a picture of it [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1576.78s)]
*  It's the only hotel I've ever been in the bed is in the middle of the room [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1578.06s)]
*  Like it's not next to any walls if that makes sense [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1581.34s)]
*  That's a normal room but it's there's I'm telling you I'll send if I'll send you a photo [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1585.5s)]
*  It's just the bed is in the middle of the room. I've never seen anything like I get dizzy in there [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1589.8200000000002s)]
*  I think then just trying to even just figure out how to get to the bathroom [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1593.8200000000002s)]
*  You got in a fucking tailwind like last night [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1596.66s)]
*  My mom came in my into my room to get me to go out and it was yeah, that's it [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1598.66s)]
*  They're just in the middle of the room [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1602.5800000000002s)]
*  There's a walkway behind it. There's a bar behind it [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1604.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's too much. I don't I like my bed in a corner [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1608.5s)]
*  I like to eliminate all possibility of things attacking me or whatever. That's how I sleep in complete fear [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1612.14s)]
*  I do love a good hotel view though. I'm a sucker for a good view. I love a good view. We went to [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1616.76s)]

*  Sounds of it is the craziest part. Yeah, I can't believe they though [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1632.5800000000002s)]
*  My only complaint actually is the bigger guys at the end. They're so big they don't fall. So the third guy [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1635.3000000000002s)]

*  Middle thing they use he got double hit it was unbelievable power slap was awesome [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1650.36s)]
*  It was what we were almost saying [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1654.52s)]
*  It was like it's more like a party [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1655.44s)]
*  Environment like just talking to everybody hanging out and then it's like instead of a band is playing it just big guys get slapped [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1656.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1662.36s)]
*  It's kind of like you're sitting there having a snack or chatting or having a um ice water or something [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  And then you can feel everybody's about somebody's about to slap somebody in the corner of the room [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1667.96s)]
*  Everybody literally goes silent for one second looks over [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1672.4s)]

*  But the craziest thing that was happening power safe was [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1778.28s)]
*  That the box was offered Terrence Crawford was there and he has a couple of beautiful young children [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1782.6s)]
*  I think they were his children. I think they were too because they were around him [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1788.56s)]
*  Yeah, mostly night unless he was by us. Yeah, he was like and the kids would come up to you and [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1791.68s)]
*  They'd be like hey, give me a hundred dollars, right? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1798.48s)]
*  But then you were talking to somebody else and I was talking to the kid and I said, oh sorry [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1802.32s)]
*  What do you ask him? He just goes I lost their bet. I want to see if I could have a hundred dollars [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1805.44s)]
*  But then at a certain point I didn't bet with him right because I don't know I mean he's a child or whatever [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1810.8400000000001s)]
*  And then he comes back a little while later. He's like pay up [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1815.88s)]
*  Pay up son. He said this [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1820.1200000000001s)]

*  That's it's so scary to think about too like Terrence Crawford could kill both of us so easily [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1852.04s)]
*  And so easily all that kid has to go do is dad this guy's being [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=1857.2s)]

*  But my grandmother would make uh [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4106.62s)]
*  She would put butter on one piece [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4109.38s)]
*  Jelly on top of that and then peanut butter on the other piece [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4112.1s)]
*  So one piece had butter just spread butter base and then a jelly and that was for some reason so good beautiful [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4115.14s)]
*  It's already good and then you add in some butter and we butters welcome to any party [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4121.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it was you know, it's like normal real salted butter like regular ass butter [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4124.96s)]
*  Not like that stuff. It's like I can't believe it's not [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4130.42s)]
*  Margarine. Yeah, cuz even that's what I've been saying with it when I've been having the jam at these are restaurants [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4133.400000000001s)]
*  Butter down first and then the jelly and it's it's it's good. But I wish butter was zero calories [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4138.820000000001s)]
*  That would make my life a lot easier [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4144.1s)]
*  Butter I always say if I could do a zero calorie food, it would be rice if I could do make rice zero calories [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4145.9400000000005s)]
*  I would be pretty hot. Is it high calories rice? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4150.54s)]
*  It's not high calories like it's supposed to be good for you [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4154.38s)]
*  But I could just it's not like it's hard before you but I could like eat chicken and rice every meal if I could [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4156.26s)]
*  I love chicken and rice. Yeah, and then if you're just grilled chicken and the rice I [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4160.66s)]
*  think I think people consider rice remotely healthy though because [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4164.3s)]
*  Everyone's all these skinny people in the city are eating grain bowls and stuff. That's a good point [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4167.740000000001s)]
*  It says right here while a cup of cooked long grain white rice is around 205 calories a cup of cooked white rice [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4172.5s)]
*  Typically contains around 250 242 calories. Yeah brown rice doesn't really have that much difference [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4178.3s)]
*  Now I'm people think it's so much healthier. That's a little life hack [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4185.18s)]
*  I do what you probably I ask them for both rice's and then you get like double the amount of rice and they do that [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4188.02s)]
*  Yeah, wow, that's one thing I popped in my brain one day. That's real good [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4192.26s)]

*  So it's kind of odd that he's my boss now [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4596.96s)]
*  Sometimes I'll get mad at me every now and then like actually the other day [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4599.719999999999s)]

*  How quickly do you think Caleb's gonna see this on our story and say oh? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4612.839999999999s)]
*  Spending that money, huh? Like spending that company money and then posted it. We're like, you know what we're gonna do [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4617.12s)]
*  We're gonna pay for this ourselves. So when he says something we have this in our back pocket [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4622.92s)]
*  Yeah, I wake up to a DM from the next day. He's like he's ago. Okay, we can't wait to look at this bill [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4626.36s)]
*  And I was like, hey bitch paid for myself [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4631.42s)]
*  But we knew it was coming so it's sometimes like that that's the one thing sometimes you that in the six months [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4634.42s)]
*  He's been my boss. Yeah, he's very good at like giving a disappointed like oh, I knew you were gonna do this [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4640.78s)]

*  I think and I mean you have to because yeah, you don't have to that [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4651.02s)]
*  There's no reason we should be spending 120 bucks per person on lunch. There's not a reason so we paid for ourselves [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4654.66s)]
*  But we would say something wish you should but it's the way that he's very good at like sounding disappointed in me [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4660.46s)]
*  And I hate when I hate when he's disappointed in me. Yeah, but also dinner lunching it goes back to that issue [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4667.04s)]
*  We're talking about that earlier when people are dinner lunching. Mm-hmm. It's like what are you doing? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4671.82s)]
*  Like it's happy, you know, and it's it's a blessing [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4676.46s)]
*  I feel like to be able to dinner lunch like to have dinner at lunch. Yes, of course [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4679.42s)]
*  It's not like no Malibu that's a dinner meal. That's not a lunch meal lunch should be a bowl a bowl from Chipotle [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4683.26s)]
*  But uh, yeah, and we did and he immediately he immediately got on us not immediately but that next night [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4688.0599999999995s)]

*  I've actually I have been whipped creaming recently. I don't know if I should say this [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4792.82s)]
*  To the masses but in an order to hopefully stay in shape I've been doing whipped cream recently in the bowl [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4797.46s)]
*  Yeah, I've been putting whipped cream in on Sunday conversation more at more whipped cream than ice cream recently [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4803.219999999999s)]
*  I've been doing some whipped cream. Yeah, cuz it's just it's a [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4808.099999999999s)]
*  Two tablespoons of whipped cream is 15 calories and if I'm doing ice cream [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4810.54s)]
*  I'm probably banging out like two pints and that's like 1200 calories and so much that's horrible [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4814.86s)]
*  Yes, sir like I'm doing a big bowl. It's like two pints of like [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4819.7s)]
*  I'm [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4822.86s)]
*  Yeah, Ben and Jerry's it's a lot of food. That's a crazy amount of sugar in front of me [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4824.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna eat it so I need to put whipped cream in the meal in the bowl because if I'm sitting there for 45 minutes [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4830.18s)]
*  I'm gonna eat it so I've been trying to do whipped cream. Yeah, and hopefully it has not ruined the product of the show [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4834.94s)]
*  I don't think it has I don't think so. I think that makes sense [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4839.7s)]
*  It's like dude you can't just be ODing over there [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4842.0599999999995s)]
*  You can't have so much sugar that your eyes won't open far and I actually I've learned eating ice cream [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4844.7s)]
*  It's weird it's so much food, but doesn't fill you up like I'll be hungry right after we're done, too [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4849.42s)]
*  And so it's basically just an extra 1200 calories in the day for like time [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4853.58s)]
*  We feel like well what a dinner after I'll just eat dinner. It's a good point. Yeah [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4858.58s)]

*  Seed oil free to tortilla chips and at first I was like, oh, you know [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4885.58s)]
*  These are they're kind of like a hearty chip, but then I had a couple like oh it kind of fills you up [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4889.38s)]
*  It just doesn't feel like this addictive thing read us eating like [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4893.46s)]
*  2,000 chips. Yeah, you know [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=4897.339999999999s)]

*  But those are the three coming. Yeah I'm curious [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5296.68s)]
*  To see how much they'll like that I don't know I would [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5298.68s)]
*  Have picked Nashville as one of the places that I would have picked [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5300.68s)]
*  I would if I had enough money I would [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5302.68s)]
*  Like to even invest in something like that but then that's [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5304.68s)]
*  Also kind of crazy I could just be [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5306.68s)]
*  You know I could just be too big [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5308.68s)]
*  Of a Caitlin Clark or Leah Boston fan [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5310.68s)]
*  So maybe I'll just maybe it'll [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5312.68s)]
*  Be an Indiana Fier fan from afar. Yeah [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5314.68s)]
*  We're champs this year baby New York Liberty [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5316.68s)]

*  Beast, Inesco. That was so [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5324.68s)]
*  Sick. I used to go to Liberty games a lot [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5326.68s)]
*  Did you? Yeah [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5328.68s)]
*  I remember there was one time I don't even think anyone [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5330.68s)]
*  Knows this happened. One time the Liberty [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5332.68s)]
*  In like 2008 or something played [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5334.68s)]
*  A basketball game in the Arthur Ashe [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5336.68s)]
*  Tennis stadium and I went to it. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5338.68s)]
*  Yeah cause my uncle used to work at the [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5340.68s)]
*  Post office he would like run the group sales for the post office [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5342.68s)]
*  So we would always get tickets everything like for ranger games [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5344.68s)]
*  I'm a big ranger hockey fan so I love the Rangers [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5346.68s)]
*  So that's how we would go to our ranger games but then he got tickets to this [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5348.68s)]
*  And they played in a tennis in our tennis arena [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5350.68s)]
*  Where they do the US Open. Oh that's so cool [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5352.68s)]
*  And I went to that I used to go to um [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5354.68s)]
*  Who's I love Tina Charles. Tina Charles was awesome [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5356.68s)]
*  She was a beast and um [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5358.68s)]
*  Yeah I used to go to Liberty games a lot [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5360.68s)]
*  But now they used to play at the garden now they don't play at the garden [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5362.68s)]
*  They play in the Barclays Center. Barclays Center [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5364.68s)]
*  Is weird to get to. Yeah. It's in Brooklyn [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5366.68s)]
*  I've only been to the Barclays Center like [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5368.68s)]
*  Five times in my life. Yeah it's fun [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5370.68s)]
*  People showed up for their parade last year. Yeah [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5372.68s)]
*  I think it's pretty sick. Yeah I love [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5374.68s)]
*  Watching uh I mean I'm just such a fever fan [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5376.68s)]
*  I've gotten to like some of the other teams you know [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5378.68s)]
*  Um I like the Valkyries [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5380.68s)]
*  Or the expansion team this year they're doing well [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5382.68s)]
*  The Aces have kind of struggled so [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5384.68s)]
*  I think it's an exciting time in the league [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5386.68s)]
*  Caitlin Clark's kind of been in and out this year though [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5388.68s)]
*  So she hasn't I think uh [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5390.68s)]
*  Their team is I think right at 500 right now [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5392.68s)]
*  They have a game tonight. Yeah I saw today they said [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5394.68s)]
*  Uh the in league [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5396.68s)]
*  Players voted her the ninth best guard in the league [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5398.68s)]
*  Which is crazy [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5400.68s)]
*  But um. There's some great guards in the league though too [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5402.68s)]
*  The VMA is fun. Anytime sports are on [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5404.68s)]
*  I'm more happy. Yeah cause as a guy [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5406.68s)]
*  First of all I'm like I can't dunk right [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5408.68s)]
*  So I can relate to all these women [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5410.68s)]
*  Most of them. And if they can I'm even like [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5412.68s)]
*  Get him out of here. You know what I'm saying [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5414.68s)]
*  Like so that kind of is a little bit much [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5416.68s)]
*  It's fun. I've always liked it. I like uh [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5418.68s)]
*  College basketball is fun to watch. I like the women's college basketball too [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5420.68s)]
*  I like watching Caitlin. I mean [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5422.68s)]
*  Another thing that I love about her she's also whether she's [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5424.68s)]
*  Even while she's playing she's also kind of [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5426.68s)]
*  Coaching like she's just like on a couple [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5428.68s)]
*  Different levels. She's so competitive [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5430.68s)]
*  Um and I love Alia Boston [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5432.68s)]
*  She's like one of my favorite players [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5434.68s)]
*  Uh there's so many I mean [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5436.68s)]
*  I could sit here and talk about the Indian [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5438.68s)]
*  Which is a little bit alarming and [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5440.68s)]
*  It's so odd to think about. I wonder how [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5442.68s)]
*  Caitlin Clark truly feels like she [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5444.68s)]
*  She's the whole league. So it's kind of [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5446.68s)]
*  I wonder how your mindset works in that [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5448.68s)]
*  In that frame of how you think like you're [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5450.68s)]
*  Technically bigger than like your coach [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5452.68s)]
*  The owner of your team. Everyone. You're just the number one person in the league [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5454.68s)]
*  How that affects your mind when you're trying to play [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5456.68s)]
*  It's crazy. She must do it well [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5458.68s)]
*  I believe that she must do it well because [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5460.68s)]
*  Otherwise it would be a catastrophe [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5462.68s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like it is. In fact [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5464.68s)]
*  It seems like she's taken like [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5466.68s)]
*  The she's made the correct choice [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5468.68s)]
*  At so many moments where she could have like spoken [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5470.68s)]
*  Differently or fallen for a lot of traps out there [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5472.68s)]
*  I'm trying to think of any other league if there's ever been [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5474.68s)]
*  Someone that has meant so much to the [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5476.68s)]
*  League like maybe like Wayne Gretzky in the NHL [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5478.68s)]
*  In the 80s. I don't really even know. I don't really even know [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5480.68s)]
*  Maybe maybe Otani [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5482.68s)]
*  Right now to the MLB. It's interesting [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5484.68s)]
*  Yeah who's meant so [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5486.68s)]
*  Much maybe Joey Chestnut [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5488.68s)]
*  Yes if we're counting Joey Chestnut [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5490.68s)]
*  That is the answer. You know what I'm saying or like [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5492.68s)]
*  He was out last year. He didn't even do it last year. Probably no one watched [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5494.68s)]
*  Because he's trying to deal with like a vegan [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5496.68s)]
*  Hot dog company until they kicked him out [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5498.68s)]
*  Well it was like live golf. He went and played [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5500.68s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia. He took that vegan money [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5502.68s)]
*  Yeah dude. And first of all [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5504.68s)]
*  Eating pork in a Muslim country I think doesn't even [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5506.68s)]
*  Go over well. But he's back to [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5508.68s)]
*  Oh Tiger. Speaking of live money [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5510.68s)]
*  Tiger is obviously a big one. Oh there you go. This year [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5512.68s)]
*  Is extra special. Also this will be a 4th of July [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5514.68s)]
*  Episode man. Have you ever been to watch him? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5516.68s)]
*  No never in person. I've never [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5518.68s)]
*  Seen him in person. I would love to. I mean he's [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5520.68s)]
*  He's a legend. He's a beast but [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5522.68s)]
*  Going to that on 4th of July I can never [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5524.68s)]
*  Imagine going to Coney Island on 4th of July. It's [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5526.68s)]
*  Like an hour away from me. It just ruins the day for me [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5528.68s)]
*  That's like thinking about like oh have you ever been to the Thanksgiving Day Parade [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5530.68s)]
*  Like it's an hour away. I'm on Long Island. I'm not going to [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5532.68s)]
*  Go ruin my Thanksgiving going to that parade. I don't know how [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5534.68s)]
*  People do it. What are you just to see balloons? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5536.68s)]
*  What's [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5538.68s)]
*  I think in the weather is usually the weather has not been good for that [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5540.68s)]
*  Recently I feel like. But I think getting a go [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5542.68s)]
*  To. I mean I guess what do you go see Joe? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5544.68s)]
*  I mean I guess maybe the kids want to go see it [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5546.68s)]
*  Maybe you've been married long enough [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5548.68s)]
*  You're like I will go watch this honky eat or whatever [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5550.68s)]
*  You know? Like I don't know [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5552.68s)]
*  Like when do you do this? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5554.68s)]
*  But also to witness a man [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5556.68s)]
*  Does it [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5558.68s)]
*  Still seem like these guys are eating [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5560.68s)]
*  I wonder? And uh [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5562.68s)]
*  Or does it seem like they're [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5564.68s)]
*  Just [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5566.68s)]
*  Processing. You know what I'm saying? That's what I start [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5568.68s)]
*  To look at. I'm watching. I'm like are they really [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5570.68s)]
*  Eating these things or dipping them in water? [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5572.68s)]
*  They're hiding them in their fucking you know. Yeah I almost [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5574.68s)]

*  Like cigar cutters [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5882.68s)]
*  I think there was a Frank Sinatra impersonator one year [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5884.68s)]
*  Of course [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5886.68s)]
*  I'm pretty sure there was one year [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5888.68s)]
*  He's got his boat going on there [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5890.68s)]
*  Just hanging out in the water with the boys [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5892.68s)]
*  That's good enough for me [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5894.68s)]
*  That's a real good day for me [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5896.68s)]
*  That is a great day [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5898.68s)]
*  Some drinks, right on the water, just some drinks [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5900.68s)]
*  Truly, I do think I'm happiest in my life [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5902.68s)]
*  When I'm having a few drinks just in the water [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5904.68s)]
*  Just floating in the water, it's the greatest [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5906.68s)]
*  I think 4th of July could do that [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5908.68s)]
*  It's nice, just pool, friends, family [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5910.68s)]
*  Yeah, do you remember when we went to Jimmy John's summer camp last year [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5912.68s)]
*  And we got to just sit in that place [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5914.68s)]
*  You guys were having some drinks in that circle [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5916.68s)]
*  We sat in that thing for like 5 hours [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5918.68s)]
*  That was so nice, dude [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5920.68s)]
*  That's my ideal day [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5922.68s)]
*  Just sitting in the water [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5924.68s)]
*  I'm trying to picture how we could even describe it [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5926.68s)]
*  It was like a disc [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5928.68s)]
*  It was a disc float, and then [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5930.68s)]
*  The netting is where we sit, so it was almost like an aquatic pouch [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5932.68s)]
*  That we were sitting in [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5934.68s)]
*  We just laid in there for 5 hours [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5936.68s)]
*  Literally all day, and it was fantastic [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5938.68s)]
*  It's like a kiddie pool that's bigger than that [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5940.68s)]
*  It's stronger sides [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5942.68s)]
*  And it'll float around in a lake or something [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5944.68s)]
*  That was also the first time I jet-skied, was with you [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5946.68s)]
*  That was very scared [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5948.68s)]
*  I'm really worried about jet-skiing [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5950.68s)]
*  Because if I fall off the jet-ski, I'm scared I won't be able to get back up [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5952.68s)]
*  And then I'm just going to be stuck in the lake [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5954.68s)]
*  Which I don't want to do [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5956.68s)]
*  But that was my first time ever jet-skiing [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5958.68s)]
*  Dang, that's crazy, man [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5960.68s)]
*  It's a freeing experience, but they go fast [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5962.68s)]
*  They go real fast [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5964.68s)]
*  First of all, way too fast [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5966.68s)]
*  Exactly [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5968.68s)]
*  And I'm a pussy, I can't do stuff that fast [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5970.68s)]
*  I'm horrible at that [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5972.68s)]
*  I'm really scared of falling off the jet-ski [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5974.68s)]
*  So I don't know if I'll do it again this year [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5976.68s)]
*  I probably will [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5978.68s)]
*  I don't think I'm a pussy, I just don't think that I'm a [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5980.68s)]
*  I'm also not a magician [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5982.68s)]
*  Or a televangelist [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5984.68s)]
*  I'm not like a [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5986.68s)]
*  What are they called? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5988.68s)]
*  I'm not like a punt return of those guys [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5990.68s)]
*  I'm just peening around on that thing [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5992.68s)]
*  You were hustling [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5994.68s)]
*  On the other end of the lake [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5996.68s)]
*  Before I even moved [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=5998.68s)]
*  You were buzzing [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6000.68s)]
*  You were in Minnesota, we started in Wisconsin [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6002.68s)]
*  Definitely, dude [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6004.68s)]
*  I was crossing state lines on that thing [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6006.68s)]
*  It was impressive [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6008.68s)]
*  You could hear the walleye getting nervous, brother [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6010.68s)]
*  I'm trying to think of a good [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6012.68s)]
*  Oh, dude, I remember this 4th of July when I was a kid [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6014.68s)]
*  So this 4th of July [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6016.68s)]
*  I had went to my friend [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6018.68s)]
*  His parents took me to their [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6020.68s)]
*  They had a beach [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6022.68s)]
*  They rented a place in Orange Beach [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6024.68s)]
*  Or something down there in Alabama [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6026.68s)]
*  And it was like [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6028.68s)]
*  If you grew up in the South, if you went to Florida [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6030.68s)]
*  Or Alabama, like Orange Beach, any of those places [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6032.68s)]
*  Like Panama City [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6034.68s)]
*  If you went to one of those places, that was like [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6036.68s)]
*  Going to the beach, dude [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6038.68s)]
*  It was like very nice [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6040.68s)]
*  So anyway, I went and they had blueberries [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6042.68s)]
*  I'd never had blueberries, I'd never seen blueberries [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6044.68s)]
*  So I was probably [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6046.68s)]
*  I'm probably 13 years old, right? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6048.68s)]
*  I'd seen blueberry muffin [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6050.68s)]
*  But I didn't know you could just have blueberries [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6052.68s)]
*  By themselves [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6054.68s)]
*  Like freelance, just like a little square [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6056.68s)]
*  Like a small rectangle thing of just [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6058.68s)]
*  Completely naked blueberries [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6060.68s)]
*  Independent blueberries, yeah [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6062.68s)]
*  Independent blueberries, and I'd never [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6064.68s)]
*  And I tried a couple of them and I was like [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6066.68s)]
*  Oh my god, they're so good [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6068.68s)]
*  So I ate probably [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6070.68s)]
*  Two of these little cage fulls of blueberries [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6072.68s)]
*  So later I am [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6074.68s)]
*  I was like, I'll just sleep out on the balcony [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6076.68s)]
*  Because I didn't want to sleep inside [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6078.68s)]
*  Because there was a lot of people standing over there [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6080.68s)]
*  They had like family friends and stuff [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6082.68s)]
*  And I started getting like [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6084.68s)]
*  I don't even know how to say it [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6086.68s)]
*  Like pretty much like diarrhea or something [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6088.68s)]
*  Blue diarrhea [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6090.68s)]
*  I mean, I got, like my stomach had never had this before [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6092.68s)]
*  And so it was like, it loved it, but it also had way too much [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6094.68s)]
*  I had probably [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6096.68s)]
*  I bet I probably had 440 blueberries [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6098.68s)]
*  So dude, I was in [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6100.68s)]
*  I ended up just [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6102.68s)]
*  Diarrhing off this balcony [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6104.68s)]
*  Like at a side [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6106.68s)]
*  It was just flying out of my body [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6108.68s)]
*  Just misting off this balcony [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6110.68s)]
*  There was nothing else I could do [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6112.68s)]
*  And I had to wash my legs with a towel and a thing of water [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6114.68s)]
*  It was horrible, dude [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6116.68s)]
*  Can you eat blueberries now or did that kill blueberries for you? [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6118.68s)]
*  No, I mean it took me [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6120.68s)]
*  A while to get back, you know, to get back around to them [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6122.68s)]
*  But [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6124.68s)]
*  You know, it was kind of like [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6126.68s)]
*  You know, yeah, at some point I gave him a second chance [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6130.68s)]
*  But that was like one of the craziest things that had happened [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6132.68s)]
*  I remember was on 4th of July [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6134.68s)]
*  Because I remember that some of them had been used to make [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6136.68s)]
*  Like the 4th of July cake [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6138.68s)]
*  They had been used [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6140.68s)]
*  For the stars on the cake [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6142.68s)]
*  Yes, when people do that [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6144.68s)]
*  Interesting thing [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6146.68s)]
*  Blueberries, I don't know how I feel about them [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6148.68s)]
*  But 4th of July, great day [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6150.68s)]
*  It still made me nervous, dude [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6152.68s)]
*  I remember it was happening so fast [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6154.68s)]
*  I was laying on my side [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6156.68s)]
*  And the balcony rails were going up [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6158.68s)]
*  And down, you know what I'm saying? [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6160.68s)]
*  I had to hold onto one of the rails with both of my hands [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6162.68s)]
*  I had to stick your ass through one of the holes [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6164.68s)]
*  Yeah, or like try to get it close [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6166.68s)]
*  It was horrible [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6168.68s)]
*  I feel so bad [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6170.68s)]
*  And there was a night security guy down there [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6172.68s)]
*  Every time his flashlight would shine [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6174.68s)]
*  I'm like, dude [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6176.68s)]
*  What are you shining your flashlight up here [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6178.68s)]
*  Like you're getting attacked by a big shit bat [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6180.68s)]
*  Or whatever [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6182.68s)]
*  What a bad day for him [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6184.68s)]
*  You're going to make him deport himself [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6186.68s)]
*  Oh, dude [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6188.68s)]
*  He was very old, I bet he didn't even notice [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6190.68s)]
*  Especially if you're a security guard in Panama City Beach [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6192.68s)]
*  You've seen worse [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6194.68s)]
*  And it was like 300 feet of distance between me and him [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6196.68s)]
*  So if anything [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6198.68s)]
*  He was getting like a [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6200.68s)]
*  Like a dusting [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6202.68s)]
*  Like something you'd put on french toast, you know [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6204.68s)]
*  That's the worst, man, I hate having to poop [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6206.68s)]
*  So annoying [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6208.68s)]
*  I thought the other day, what if we didn't have to poop [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6210.68s)]
*  I know it's like a side effect of being alive or whatever [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6212.68s)]
*  But imagine if we didn't [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6214.68s)]
*  Or if it never left your body [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6216.68s)]
*  You could only have a couple things in your whole life [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6218.68s)]
*  Because it would build up too much [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6220.68s)]
*  Ooh [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6222.68s)]
*  I carry around the horrible life [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6224.68s)]
*  I'd rather poop, I would need to eat [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6226.68s)]
*  I need to have all of that [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6228.68s)]
*  But just so much anxiety like when you're out at a restaurant [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6230.68s)]
*  Yeah, I got to do this [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6232.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6234.68s)]
*  Like [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6236.68s)]
*  My body usually lets you know if I have to poop [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6238.68s)]
*  When I'm at home [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6240.68s)]
*  I think so [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6242.68s)]
*  I recently only, the last few years I've only [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6244.68s)]
*  Become one [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6246.68s)]
*  That can poop in public [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6248.68s)]
*  I've always been a home pooper [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6250.68s)]
*  But now I've learned to do [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6252.68s)]
*  Outside as well [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6254.68s)]
*  Not outside, but like [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6256.68s)]
*  And do you remember the first place you ever [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6258.68s)]
*  Vacationed or whatever? [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6260.68s)]
*  No, that you took a poop outside [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6262.68s)]
*  I mean [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6264.68s)]
*  I'm not saying outside, I'm just saying like [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6266.68s)]
*  Outside of the home, right? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6268.68s)]
*  The first place you took like a little [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6270.68s)]
*  I'm always fine with like hotel, I mean like I got like a restaurant [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6272.68s)]
*  And a gas station, I think it was like a gas station [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6274.68s)]
*  In Alabama, we were doing some sort of road trip [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6276.68s)]
*  For, it was called Barstow [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6278.68s)]
*  Versus America, and it was like a [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6280.68s)]
*  Ten city road trip and we were on RV, so [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6282.68s)]
*  Literally we had to, so that was when I [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6284.68s)]
*  Learned how to do it, but like backwoods, Alabama [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6286.68s)]
*  Gas station, and it was kind of, it was [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6288.68s)]
*  It was fine, we got through it, you know [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6290.68s)]
*  Not a poop shame [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6292.68s)]
*  No, yeah I think especially like you just have [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6294.68s)]
*  To realize that everybody's doing it, you know [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6296.68s)]
*  You have, you really really do, but [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6298.68s)]
*  It's kind of crazy that everybody's doing it [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6300.68s)]
*  I still don't believe it [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6302.68s)]
*  You know, it's crazy [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6304.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's just as crazy as thinking that [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6306.68s)]
*  260 million chickens are killed [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6308.68s)]
*  Each day [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6310.68s)]
*  I do like to do it though, it's awesome [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6312.68s)]
*  But I never think of anyone else doing it, you know [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6314.68s)]
*  Like maybe one night, me and you were at dinner one night, and let's say [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6316.68s)]
*  Go to the bathroom for five minutes [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6318.68s)]
*  Is he freshening up or is he [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6320.68s)]
*  Pooping, you don't know [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6322.68s)]
*  Well the craziest thing is if you like [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6324.68s)]
*  Say you go like [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6326.68s)]
*  If you have to, if you try to [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6328.68s)]
*  Poop at a high speed because you [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6330.68s)]
*  Don't want people to think you're in there [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6332.68s)]
*  Doing a number two, right? Exactly [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6334.68s)]
*  That is very taxing on the [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6336.68s)]
*  System I think. Look that up [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6338.68s)]
*  Is it even okay to kind of [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6340.68s)]
*  Shit at high speed or whatever? [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6342.68s)]
*  Yeah, I need to like chill for a few minutes, I can't [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6344.68s)]
*  It's very hard to get in and out, I need to chill [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6346.68s)]
*  Well yeah, cause if you like [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6348.68s)]
*  Pooping fast, meaning having a bowel [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6350.68s)]
*  Movement quickly is not [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6352.68s)]
*  Inherently bad, in fact it can be a sign [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6354.68s)]
*  Of a healthy digestive system as long as it's not [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6356.68s)]
*  Accompanied by discomfort [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6358.68s)]
*  Or other concerning symptoms [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6360.68s)]
*  Normal transits [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6362.68s)]
*  On my bowel movement should ideally take a couple [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6364.68s)]
*  Of minutes with minimal straining [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6366.68s)]
*  Okay, but right, but okay then how [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6368.68s)]
*  Long does it take to urinate in a [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6370.68s)]
*  Restaurant or whatever? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6372.68s)]
*  I'm gonna say two minutes [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6374.68s)]
*  But that, the pooping just said [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6376.68s)]
*  Let me see, 15 to 30 seconds to empty [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6378.68s)]
*  Their bladder. What? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6380.68s)]
*  Where'd you get your bladder from, dude? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6382.68s)]
*  It's like Austin Powers' SP [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6384.68s)]
*  30 seconds is a lot of pee [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6386.68s)]
*  And I'm trying to pee more. 30 seconds is a lot of pee? [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6388.68s)]
*  You think it's less? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6390.68s)]
*  Dude, I will rat, I blatantly [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6392.68s)]
*  I casually will piss [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6394.68s)]
*  For fucking 70 seconds [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6396.68s)]
*  I just heard you had a nice stream [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6398.68s)]
*  That was nothing. That was a nice stream for like a few minutes [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6400.68s)]
*  That was nothing, I could still cry after that [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6402.68s)]
*  I could pee so much that I can't cry [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6404.68s)]
*  For an hour. Really? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6406.68s)]
*  I'm a quick peer then I think [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6408.68s)]
*  I'll put it all out. I don't even, I'm very [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6410.68s)]

*  Tight anymore because I don't want that added [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6416.68s)]
*  Outside influence [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6418.68s)]
*  All natural. Yeah, because it'll kind of like [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6420.68s)]
*  Tighten around your bladder, you know? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6422.68s)]
*  I don't like that. I like to pee as God wants [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6424.68s)]
*  As I want. You ever done a [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6426.68s)]
*  Poop on a plane? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6428.68s)]
*  Sure I have [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6430.68s)]
*  Not one that stands up. It's just so [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6432.68s)]
*  Compartmentalized you literally feel like [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6434.68s)]
*  You're playing hide and go seek and having to shit at the same time [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6436.68s)]
*  Yeah. You know you're just [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6438.68s)]
*  Kind of like. Yeah you're talking about pooping on high speed [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6440.68s)]
*  That's what came into my brain immediately [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6442.68s)]
*  That's going 400 miles an hour [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6444.68s)]
*  That's a top speed [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6446.68s)]
*  It's about as fast as you could go in the world [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6448.68s)]
*  Yeah. That's crazy. It is [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6450.68s)]
*  Planes are crazy [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6452.68s)]
*  I don't even let myself think about planes [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6454.68s)]
*  Because they're so [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6456.68s)]
*  Even planes now are crazy [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6458.68s)]
*  How did someone even come up with the idea for a plane? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6460.68s)]
*  How did the Wright brothers even do that? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6462.68s)]
*  And in like [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6464.68s)]
*  What did they make it in like 1920? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6466.68s)]
*  It was flying. But the planes were shitty [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6468.68s)]
*  A lot of people died right out of the gate [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6470.68s)]
*  Like there were apparently like seven Wright brothers [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6472.68s)]
*  And we only know about two of them so. Is that actually true? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6474.68s)]
*  Right there [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6476.68s)]
*  1903? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6478.68s)]
*  Yeah. So why [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6480.68s)]
*  Did someone, why did people even get on the Titanic? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6482.68s)]
*  There were planes nine years before [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6484.68s)]
*  I don't know that's a great question [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6486.68s)]
*  Dude. Oh my [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6488.68s)]
*  God. That was nine [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6490.68s)]
*  Years before the Titanic [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6492.68s)]
*  Yeah that's unreal [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6494.68s)]
*  Can we just hold out one more year? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6496.68s)]
*  There'll be a decent flight over there [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6498.68s)]
*  Wait can you just look up the first transcontinental flight? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6500.68s)]
*  Now I need to see when we finally [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6502.68s)]
*  Cross the ocean. I'll be flying right above the Titanic [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6504.68s)]
*  That's so [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6506.68s)]
*  You know what's another weird crazy thing to think about [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6508.68s)]
*  You know the Hindenburg? That was a [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6510.68s)]
*  Blimp. That just came here from Germany [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6512.68s)]
*  They blimped from Germany [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6514.68s)]
*  1911 [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6516.68s)]
*  Before the Titanic [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6518.68s)]
*  The first transcontinental flight across the United States [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6520.68s)]
*  Was made by Calbrah Perry [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6522.68s)]
*  Rogers in 1911 taking [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6524.68s)]
*  49 days with numerous stops [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6526.68s)]
*  And crashes [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6528.68s)]
*  That doesn't sound like a successful flight [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6530.68s)]
*  It took [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6532.68s)]
*  49 days to get there dude [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6534.68s)]
*  Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6536.68s)]
*  Wow anything taken off out of Brooklyn [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6538.68s)]
*  Is questionable dude [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6540.68s)]
*  There's a lot of Haitians over there in the park [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6542.68s)]
*  These days at Williamsburg. There's a reason both [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6544.68s)]
*  Airports are in Queens, LaGuardia and JFK [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6546.68s)]
*  Oh there's a lot of Haitians selling [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6548.68s)]
*  Sex in the park over there that Biden [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6550.68s)]
*  Let in. That's what I heard. I believe it [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6552.68s)]
*  Oh man that's true [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6554.68s)]
*  That's a fun fact [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6556.68s)]
*  Oh yeah I just saw this the other day [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6558.68s)]
*  Wifi routers now tracking [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6560.68s)]
*  Motion. Xfinity's new [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6562.68s)]
*  Feature [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6564.68s)]
*  Since the start of the year Xfinity [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6566.68s)]
*  A major Comcast brand for telecommunication [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6568.68s)]
*  Services in America has been notifying [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6570.68s)]
*  Users about a useful new feature [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6572.68s)]
*  Wifi motion [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6574.68s)]
*  It allows turning internet devices [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6576.68s)]
*  Into motion sensors that monitor [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6578.68s)]
*  Movement at home [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6580.68s)]
*  I believe [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6582.68s)]
*  The other day I was in one of those [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6584.68s)]
*  Waymo's. You ever been to Waymo yet? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6586.68s)]
*  No I haven't been in it. The self driving cars [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6588.68s)]
*  I was in one in Santa Monica [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6590.68s)]
*  And they have [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6592.68s)]
*  Sensors around them that literally [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6594.68s)]
*  The screen in the car it not only tracks [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6596.68s)]
*  The cars around you it tracks the people on the street [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6598.68s)]
*  So like if you're at a stop sign [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6600.68s)]
*  And people are crossing the street [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6602.68s)]
*  You see little tiny people on the map crossing [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6604.68s)]
*  Like it mimics their movements [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6606.68s)]
*  I guess it must be some sort of the same technology as that [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6608.68s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6610.68s)]
*  Yeah that sounds super terrifying [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6612.68s)]
*  They have that too in Tesla's [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6614.68s)]
*  Where you can see the people and even if it's a guy [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6616.68s)]
*  With dreadlocks you see that it's kind of crazy [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6618.68s)]
*  Like if it's a person carrying a bag or something [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6620.68s)]
*  But the idea like I guess [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6622.68s)]
*  What are the concerns about this it says how does [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6624.68s)]
*  It sense motion? Wifi signals travel [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6626.68s)]
*  Between the router and other devices [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6628.68s)]
*  And anything between them can disrupt the signal [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6630.68s)]
*  Wifi signals bounce around [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6632.68s)]
*  And the sensing area is not a straight line [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6634.68s)]
*  But an oval between the two devices [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6636.68s)]
*  So it's like if you pass [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6638.68s)]
*  Like you know it'll just be able to know [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6640.68s)]
*  Where you are in your home [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6642.68s)]
*  That seems really scary [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6644.68s)]
*  I guess it could kind of maybe be good for [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6646.68s)]
*  Not health reasons but if people [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6648.68s)]
*  Suddenly die like if they stop moving [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6650.68s)]
*  Out of the blue maybe they could pick that up [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6652.68s)]
*  That's a good point [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6654.68s)]
*  You know like if someone trips and falls [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6656.68s)]
*  Like an old person can't get up [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6658.68s)]
*  Like at least notify maybe that would be a good thing [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6660.68s)]
*  But how many people are going to forget [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6662.68s)]
*  This even happens they probably have it activated [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6664.68s)]
*  Already in their homes they don't even know it [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6666.68s)]
*  And then there's some dude [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6668.68s)]
*  At a back call center somewhere [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6670.68s)]
*  Outside of [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6672.68s)]
*  Outside of Toledo and he's just [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6674.68s)]
*  Watching some hologram lonely [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6676.68s)]
*  Dude just jerk off for like [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6678.68s)]
*  This is 600 times [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6680.68s)]
*  He's walking the silhouette just go up and down [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6682.68s)]
*  I mean [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6684.68s)]
*  Let him have fun I know but [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6686.68s)]
*  But then he streams [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6688.68s)]
*  That to like India or some other [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6690.68s)]
*  Country where they you know and then [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6692.68s)]
*  You're basically being live streamed [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6694.68s)]
*  The hologram of you is being live streamed out [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6696.68s)]
*  It's just like [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6698.68s)]
*  I don't know everything's just getting too crazy dude [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6700.68s)]
*  Yeah technology [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6702.68s)]
*  I'm out on it I'm not a big fan of it [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6704.68s)]
*  I mean it's scary [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6706.68s)]
*  Like we just had to wear these [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6708.68s)]

*  Like if you were talking Spanish to me right now [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6722.68s)]

*  And the villain because it's a two part movie [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6776.68s)]
*  This is the second part that just came out [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6778.68s)]
*  The villain is AI [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6780.68s)]
*  Like what do you mean when he's an AI villain [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6782.68s)]
*  Like he's a what like what do you mean by that [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6784.68s)]
*  It was like he's a computer [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6786.68s)]
*  Yeah so the first scene [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6788.68s)]
*  I think it's these guys on a some of these army guys [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6790.68s)]
*  On a submarine and there's this [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6792.68s)]
*  There's this I think it's [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6794.68s)]
*  Maybe the Russians or something they made this AI [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6796.68s)]
*  System and the system [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6798.68s)]
*  Overrides it and like becomes its own entity [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6800.68s)]
*  And like killed like they're sending out a missile [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6802.68s)]
*  And then the system sends the missile back into them [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6804.68s)]
*  So all those dudes die [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6806.68s)]
*  And then it's like it's this AI thing it's like a [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6808.68s)]
*  AI monster it's wild [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6810.68s)]
*  Fuck [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6812.68s)]
*  To the point where it's a Mission Impossible villain [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6814.68s)]
*  Oh it's definitely dude it's getting to the point where all these like [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6816.68s)]
*  All these like tech guys right [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6818.68s)]
*  They're all like trying to platform [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6820.68s)]
*  Like I think they're all going to stay want to put [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6822.68s)]
*  Chips in it it's all going to get to the point where we [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6824.68s)]
*  They all own [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6826.68s)]
*  And we're they use us [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6828.68s)]
*  As their robot that's what's [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6830.68s)]
*  Starting that like that's where I believe [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6832.68s)]
*  That things kind of seem like they're going [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6834.68s)]
*  Because you have a few tech companies [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6836.68s)]
*  They're going to start to own everything [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6838.68s)]
*  So we're all going to be [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6840.68s)]
*  And they do they do too many insane [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6842.68s)]
*  Things like my buddy Tommy Tommy [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6844.68s)]
*  Smokes this great guy he fucking puts in obituaries [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6846.68s)]
*  For me on AI and they send out [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6848.68s)]
*  Like an obituary for myself [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6850.68s)]
*  It's terrifying I don't want to see my obituary [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6852.68s)]
*  When does it say what does it happen [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6854.68s)]
*  They had me doing [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6856.68s)]
*  I forgot what it was [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6858.68s)]
*  It was something in Vegas though [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6860.68s)]
*  What month oh you died in Vegas [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6862.68s)]
*  No that was what it was like I was found in his hotel in Vegas [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6864.68s)]
*  I think and [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6866.68s)]
*  I'll send it to me he sent it to me [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6868.68s)]
*  They made a long huge obituary for myself [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6870.68s)]
*  January that's when I want to go [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6872.68s)]
*  Not this January [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6874.68s)]
*  Yeah because it's always a tough month kind of I feel like [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6876.68s)]
*  A lot has been fun and then you're kind of figuring out [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6878.68s)]
*  The new year and the big football month [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6880.68s)]
*  That's a good point [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6882.68s)]
*  I think the worst month which I wouldn't mind going [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6884.68s)]
*  I want to enjoy summer [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6886.68s)]
*  So maybe I don't really know I love every month [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6888.68s)]
*  Yeah you're right [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6890.68s)]
*  It's hard to find a bad month maybe April [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6892.68s)]
*  April's kind of yeah [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6894.68s)]
*  I think you're right [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6896.68s)]
*  There's not much happening in April [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6898.68s)]
*  Yeah we're waiting for the next thing [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6900.68s)]
*  How's the new whip man from OnlyStans [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6902.68s)]
*  Didn't you get a new car [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6904.68s)]
*  Yeah well it lives in Calibs [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6906.68s)]
*  I gave it to Calib [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6908.68s)]
*  So it's literally a [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6910.68s)]
*  It's a moke so it's like a baby between [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6912.68s)]
*  A jeep and a golf cart basically [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6914.68s)]
*  So it's a little tiny car [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6916.68s)]
*  And the lovely lady lives in Florida [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6918.68s)]
*  That got it for me Bryce Adams [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6920.68s)]
*  So I originally was [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6922.68s)]
*  Planning on I originally was planning on [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6924.68s)]
*  Driving it back to Calibs [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6926.68s)]
*  And just leaving it at Calibs and then [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6928.68s)]
*  You can't even drive on the highway with it I didn't realize like how [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6930.68s)]
*  Slow it is it's like [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6932.68s)]
*  It only goes 25 miles an hour so driving from her house [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6934.68s)]
*  To Calibs house would have taken legitimately [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6936.68s)]
*  Probably like 8 hours and [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6938.68s)]
*  It's just super slow [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6940.68s)]
*  Very slow but it's awesome [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6942.68s)]
*  Honestly me and Calib have not been in Delray in so long [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6944.68s)]
*  I haven't been able to drive it in a while [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6946.68s)]
*  But yeah it lives in Calibs house now [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6948.68s)]
*  So this girl really just bought that for you [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6950.68s)]
*  Yeah it was pretty awesome [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6952.68s)]
*  It was definitely pretty awesome and it's always been one of my dreams [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6954.68s)]
*  To own those things like they're so sick [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6956.68s)]
*  The one problem is I definitely underestimated how slow [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6958.68s)]
*  They are they're very slow but driving [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6960.68s)]
*  Around in it driving around Delray Beach in it [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6962.68s)]
*  Put some tunes on it's a fantastic [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6964.68s)]
*  Little vibe go to the beach I've gone to the beach [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6966.68s)]
*  With it twice so far and it's fantastic [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6968.68s)]
*  But yeah there's really no way I could even [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6970.68s)]
*  Get it to New York I don't even know how I would go about getting it to home [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6972.68s)]
*  And it wouldn't play well at home [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6974.68s)]
*  Because we have a great little beach town by us but I'm like 20 minutes from the beach [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6976.68s)]
*  So I can't even bring it there [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6978.68s)]
*  So I think leaving it at Calibs is perfect and then whenever I'm in Delray [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6980.68s)]
*  I can enjoy it and play with it [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6982.68s)]
*  And it's amazing and it's a beautiful [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6984.68s)]
*  Beautiful car I love it [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6986.68s)]
*  Yeah it's really neat looking it looks like I'm a G wagon kind of but it's like a small G wagon [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6988.68s)]
*  Yeah my one problem though is I couldn't figure out the seats for the longest time [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6990.68s)]
*  So I was driving around very uncomfortably [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6992.68s)]
*  I was like scrunched up in the middle of it [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6994.68s)]
*  Now I've actually figured it out though [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6996.68s)]
*  And it's awesome got bluetooth hooked up in there [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=6998.68s)]
*  It's a great vibe it's just a good vibe for sure [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7000.68s)]
*  But then they'll be able to own it [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7002.68s)]
*  Dude that in a couple of like [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7004.68s)]
*  In a year from now say you want to go somewhere [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7006.68s)]
*  But then the AI decides you can't [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7008.68s)]
*  They're like nah come back [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7010.68s)]
*  You're out [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7012.68s)]
*  If you work in one hour you have to [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7014.68s)]
*  That's what starts to scare me [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7016.68s)]
*  You think I'm being scared too much Glenny? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7018.68s)]
*  I don't think you're being scared [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7020.68s)]
*  Everyone freaks out about AI [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7022.68s)]
*  AI is terrible like when you have this entity of a computer [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7024.68s)]
*  That could be it's own being it's scary [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7026.68s)]
*  The other day actually I was walking around in Santa Monica [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7028.68s)]
*  I walked past a Tesla store and they had the robot in the window [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7030.68s)]
*  And it was creepy to see [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7032.68s)]
*  Like you are that's movie shit [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7034.68s)]

*  Seeing that robot in that window [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7038.68s)]
*  Was terrifying [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7040.68s)]
*  I don't need robots [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7042.68s)]
*  Yeah just like god I thought we were having a decent time [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7044.68s)]
*  And everything is fucking getting weird [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7046.68s)]
*  I just don't understand and some people have the robots [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7048.68s)]
*  Like in their house I don't know if I could live in a house with a robot [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7050.68s)]
*  How could you live in a house with a robot [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7052.68s)]
*  You know it's listening the fucking wi-fi is now listening [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7054.68s)]
*  The wi-fi now knows where you're moving around [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7056.68s)]
*  Can you imagine [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7058.68s)]
*  Waking up one night [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7060.68s)]
*  In the middle of the night and it's just in your room [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7062.68s)]

*  I'm thinking like 200 years on the line [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7094.68s)]
*  When they're in society kind of [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7096.68s)]
*  I'm just scared man [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7098.68s)]

*  That they can like know where you're at in your home [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7102.68s)]
*  Just so they know right [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7104.68s)]
*  And you're right if you're an old person you fall in immediately [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7106.68s)]
*  I think that's one immediate pro [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7108.68s)]
*  That thing is great [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7110.68s)]
*  Or you don't want to go to work right [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7112.68s)]
*  And you say you're sick but you're not [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7114.68s)]
*  You're just at home building like [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7116.68s)]
*  One of those houses a car [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7118.68s)]
*  Doing some fun thing doing a puzzle or something [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7120.68s)]

*  You're not sick you know what I'm saying [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7124.68s)]
*  It could get to that point where it's just like [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7126.68s)]
*  You can't even lie you know [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7128.68s)]
*  It would be nice to not be able to lie but it's also fun [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7130.68s)]
*  To be able to just make a puzzle sometimes or be by yourself [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7132.68s)]
*  Yeah we kind of have wifi ratting on us [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7134.68s)]
*  That's what it crosses the line That's what you would have [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7136.68s)]
*  I don't want wifi ratting on us [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7138.68s)]
*  You got to be able to do what's in the comfort of your own home [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7140.68s)]
*  In the comfort of your own home without the wifi [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7142.68s)]
*  Checking us out [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7144.68s)]
*  Or if you said a bad word or something [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7146.68s)]
*  That would report you [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7148.68s)]
*  Someone said [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7150.68s)]
*  Sh** in the 400 block [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7152.68s)]
*  In the 400 [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7154.68s)]
*  Block of Long Island [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7156.68s)]
*  Hey what happened to that Long Island serial killer [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7158.68s)]
*  You ever crossed paths with him [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7160.68s)]
*  No but he legitimately [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7162.68s)]
*  So my best friend Johnny [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7164.68s)]
*  He lives around the block from him literally the house was around the block [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7166.68s)]
*  20 minutes from my house [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7168.68s)]
*  My favorite Cajun restaurant is [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7170.68s)]
*  Right next to my favorite Cajun restaurant [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7172.68s)]
*  This place Big Daddy's he's [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7174.68s)]
*  Four minutes from [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7176.68s)]
*  It's terrifying to think about he was doing [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7178.68s)]
*  I just watched a three part documentary on it that came out last week [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7180.68s)]
*  He was doing a New York City commute [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7182.68s)]
*  Every single day [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7184.68s)]
*  I would almost say it's not crazy that me and him [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7186.68s)]
*  Have probably been on the same train together or something before [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7188.68s)]
*  Because he was doing the [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7190.68s)]
*  I'm on that same train line and he was doing the commute [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7192.68s)]
*  To and from New York for 20 years [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7194.68s)]
*  I would venture to guess we were probably on a train together at some point [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7196.68s)]
*  Which is very very scary to think about [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7198.68s)]
*  He's 20 minutes from my house [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7200.68s)]
*  And that documentary is [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7202.68s)]
*  It was on Peacock I think it was a very very very interesting watch [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7204.68s)]
*  The Gilgo Beach serial killer [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7206.68s)]
*  Yeah like this is so where he dumped all these bodies [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7208.68s)]
*  The Gilgo Beach [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7210.68s)]
*  This was my COVID drive every Friday [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7212.68s)]
*  During COVID like there was nothing to do [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7214.68s)]
*  I would just take this ride down the beach [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7216.68s)]
*  Like it's like a 40 minute drive from my house [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7218.68s)]
*  And I didn't even realize this is where all the bodies are [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7220.68s)]
*  And it's scary because there's no [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7222.68s)]
*  Businesses there's nothing there it's really just the beach [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7224.68s)]
*  And a few houses and it's a one lane highway [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7226.68s)]
*  And that's where he dumped all those bodies [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7228.68s)]
*  It's terrifying [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7230.68s)]
*  That's crazy [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7232.68s)]
*  It almost doesn't even cross my brain of how [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7234.68s)]
*  Simulated he was into [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7236.68s)]
*  Like life [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7238.68s)]
*  I did that drive every Friday during COVID [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7240.68s)]
*  Right and imagine you're driving it's hard enough [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7242.68s)]
*  To even pull over to change a tire or something [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7244.68s)]
*  Especially on a busy road [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7246.68s)]
*  He did it there's probably no one around [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7248.68s)]
*  And the only thing you're surrounded by [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7250.68s)]
*  Is water really because the one lane highway [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7252.68s)]
*  It's two lanes each way [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7254.68s)]
*  What a crazy world to live in [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7256.68s)]
*  Did you see I don't know if this is too much talk [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7258.68s)]
*  Of a topic but I've really been keeping up with it [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7260.68s)]
*  Did you see they that [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7262.68s)]
*  Coburger guy took a plea [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7264.68s)]
*  Deal today he said he's not [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7266.68s)]
*  So he's just not going to get the death penalty he's going to go to jail [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7268.68s)]
*  For the rest of your life [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7270.68s)]
*  I'm not a fan of him I don't like that very much [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7272.68s)]
*  Oh I think that's unbelievable I think that [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7274.68s)]
*  The parents I think there's a video [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7276.68s)]
*  They asked the father what he thought about it [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7278.68s)]
*  I think that's one of the parents [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7280.68s)]
*  The parents are definitely mad about it [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7282.68s)]
*  They are [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7284.68s)]
*  It's hard to say when you're in that position [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7286.68s)]
*  But I almost think a life of [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7288.68s)]
*  Prison would be worse than death penalty [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7290.68s)]
*  Oh well here's what I think he's going to get killed [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7292.68s)]
*  In prison pretty quick I would think so too [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7294.68s)]
*  And that's way worse than a fine [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7296.68s)]
*  I think we're all just [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7298.68s)]
*  I hope he gets killed in prison I don't like him very much [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7300.68s)]
*  He's the worst person [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7302.68s)]
*  I'm a proponent of [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7304.68s)]
*  The death penalty I believe that he [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7306.68s)]
*  I think that's a good point [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7308.68s)]
*  Because here's the thing it's like we're wandering around [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7310.68s)]
*  With Satan and pure evil amongst us [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7312.68s)]
*  I know that people make mistakes and things happen [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7314.68s)]
*  That I understand [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7316.68s)]
*  But sometimes we're wandering around with pure evil [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7318.68s)]
*  And we're like hey [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7320.68s)]
*  Maybe we should see how pure evil [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7322.68s)]
*  Feels on a witness stand for [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7324.68s)]
*  Seven years I don't give a fuck [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7326.68s)]
*  If it's pure evil [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7328.68s)]
*  Why don't you tell me that Xfinity [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7330.68s)]
*  Just tell me who's pure evil [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7332.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7334.68s)]
*  I don't think we would ask AI that because I think it would probably turn immediately on a lot of its creators [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7336.68s)]
*  That one was about as bad as it gets [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7340.68s)]
*  I've been keeping up with that for the whole time [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7342.68s)]
*  I don't know why that really struck with me [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7344.68s)]
*  The Cobra one? [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7346.68s)]
*  Scary, so terrible [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7348.68s)]
*  And I've seen the pictures of them [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7350.68s)]
*  They're just normal college kids [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7352.68s)]
*  That's like [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7354.68s)]
*  Just a crazy night out on the town it seemed like [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7356.68s)]
*  Yeah, normal Friday Saturday night whatever it was [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7358.68s)]
*  Come home [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7360.68s)]
*  And they're probably all still drunk [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7362.68s)]
*  And then they just wake up and this fucking nut job is here [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7364.68s)]
*  And the guy looks like [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7366.68s)]
*  So scary [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7368.68s)]
*  Like a partner of Satan [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7370.68s)]
*  Or buddy of Satan [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7372.68s)]
*  It's like we keep acting like these people that look like Satan [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7374.68s)]
*  Aren't Satan [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7376.68s)]
*  Like I love how people are like [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7378.68s)]
*  Yeah that guy looks like he's not doing well [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7380.68s)]
*  That guy to me looks like a Satan guy [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7382.68s)]
*  He's horrifying [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7384.68s)]
*  He's horrifying [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7386.68s)]
*  That was I was like it was a [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7388.68s)]
*  Because he got in there [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7390.68s)]
*  And wait didn't the door dash lady see him? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7392.68s)]
*  I don't know [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7394.68s)]
*  Because I think it's seen [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7396.68s)]
*  And it's so terrible too because [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7398.68s)]
*  I don't know who saw him I think he snuck in [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7400.68s)]
*  And then he went [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7402.68s)]
*  I don't know which child he went for first [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7404.68s)]
*  It's so scary [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7406.68s)]
*  But that was it was interesting to see how the police [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7408.68s)]
*  Did that work because I remember everyone was freaking out [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7410.68s)]
*  Like where is he? Where is he? Where is he? [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7412.68s)]
*  And meanwhile they were tracking him for like two weeks which was awesome [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7414.68s)]
*  They got him in fucking Pennsylvania [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7416.68s)]
*  They knew [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7418.68s)]
*  And he also did a horrible job at it [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7420.68s)]
*  They were seeing what he was up to trying to get [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7422.68s)]
*  Everyone was like where is this guy? Where is this guy? [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7424.68s)]
*  And they knew the whole time [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7426.68s)]
*  Because he also left that knife [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7428.68s)]
*  Sheath there too [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7430.68s)]
*  That was a creepy story [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7432.68s)]
*  Because it's so scary because so many times you've gotten home [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7434.68s)]
*  It's been drunk with your friend [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7436.68s)]
*  What's going on? You wake up you don't even know [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7438.68s)]
*  Things are scary enough you can barely remember [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7440.68s)]
*  And then everyone was freaking out because there were other two girls that were in there [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7442.68s)]
*  That didn't say anything [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7444.68s)]
*  Caught up in their rooms [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7446.68s)]
*  And then they were like, oh, he's obviously scared shitless [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7448.68s)]
*  One of them saw him I think [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7450.68s)]
*  It's crazy [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7452.68s)]
*  Yeah, all the little things that happen man, it's so heartbreaking [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7454.68s)]
*  Just the pain of the families go through [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7456.68s)]
*  And then I bet there's a weird part [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7458.68s)]
*  Where you want to never have it be in the media [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7460.68s)]
*  But at the same time like [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7462.68s)]
*  You almost get addicted [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7464.68s)]
*  To watching the story unfold [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7466.68s)]
*  Because you have, it's all that's there [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7468.68s)]
*  Of your child still in a weird way [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7470.68s)]
*  I don't know, that might sound crazy [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7472.68s)]
*  Does that sound crazy? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7474.68s)]
*  I don't think so, you're saying about people talking about it in the news [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7476.68s)]
*  Right, because you want your child to be alive [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7478.68s)]
*  So it's like the fact that their name [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7480.68s)]
*  Is being [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7482.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, I don't know [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7484.68s)]
*  But yeah, that was a story that really [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7486.68s)]
*  Cut me deep, it was terrifying [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7488.68s)]
*  I did not like that, obviously [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7490.68s)]
*  Well it's just like, yeah, how long [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7492.68s)]
*  Do we just live amongst evil [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7494.68s)]
*  And pretend that we, it's not [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7496.68s)]
*  Dudes like that, and dudes like this year, like the Long Island [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7498.68s)]
*  Gilgo Beach killer, yeah, it's like what we're saying [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7500.68s)]
*  I would venture to guess I've been on a train [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7502.68s)]
*  With that guy [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7504.68s)]
*  I would not be shocked, if I somehow could look [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7506.68s)]
*  I could look up our train records [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7508.68s)]
*  I bet we've been on the same, let's say train [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7510.68s)]
*  Or cross paths [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7512.68s)]
*  What if you sat there next to him, huh? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7514.68s)]
*  I actually saw a clip of a girl [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7516.68s)]
*  Saying she was on the train, he like came and sat [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7518.68s)]
*  Next to her one day, and she was like, I remember that guy [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7520.68s)]
*  And he was like, he said something very weird to her [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7522.68s)]
*  And then she just got off the train, but [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7524.68s)]
*  Even thinking about that, like that woman too is like [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7526.68s)]
*  Just had a little brush [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7528.68s)]
*  With true evil [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7530.68s)]
*  I met a dude one time [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7532.68s)]
*  Who [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7534.68s)]
*  His mom had [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7536.68s)]
*  Rejected the [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7538.68s)]
*  Who was the guy that killed everybody at Florida State? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7540.68s)]
*  Not Dahmer [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7542.68s)]
*  Ted Bundy was, I didn't know Ted Bundy was Florida State [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7544.68s)]
*  Ted Bundy, at the end of his whole deal [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7546.68s)]
*  He killed some people at Florida State at a sorority house [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7548.68s)]
*  I think that's where they, after that they busted him [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7550.68s)]
*  But somebody had escaped him [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7552.68s)]
*  Like, dang [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7554.68s)]
*  Yeah, scary to think about, even [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7556.68s)]
*  Son of Sam, like I remember my parents [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7558.68s)]
*  My parents always tell me this, in like 1977 [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7560.68s)]
*  They say it was like the summer of Sam [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7562.68s)]
*  There's a Spike Lee man movie about it even [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7564.68s)]
*  He, there was one time [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7566.68s)]
*  In the summer, it was, the whole city went blacked out [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7568.68s)]
*  And he was like [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7570.68s)]
*  Free, he knew there was a serial killer [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7572.68s)]
*  The whole city had to black out [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7574.68s)]
*  And they said, the whole city was freaking out [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7576.68s)]
*  Because no one knows where he is, no one knows who he is [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7578.68s)]
*  It's 1977, there's no lights [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7580.68s)]
*  Like my dad said, like him and his friends [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7582.68s)]
*  Like, walking around with like bats, just like [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7584.68s)]
*  Trying to find him, like you're just going to find the son of Sam [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7586.68s)]
*  But yeah, they said that was like one of the scariest days ever [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7588.68s)]
*  That's so sick [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7590.68s)]
*  And also crazy to think, this guy he's 24 [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7592.68s)]
*  He did this when he was 24, I think the guy looks like 24 years old [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7594.68s)]
*  Yeah, first of all [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7596.68s)]
*  Yeah, if I saw this dude [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7598.68s)]
*  I would immediately be like, hey [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7600.68s)]
*  This dude's a serial killer [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7602.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was a nut, he claimed that he was like talking to his neighbor's dog [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7604.68s)]
*  And his neighbor's dog made him do it [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7606.68s)]
*  Yeah, oh dude, a lot of times people are like [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7608.68s)]
*  God, I think that guy's a serial killer [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7610.68s)]
*  Well hey, check it out and see if he is, okay [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7612.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you should be laughing [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7614.68s)]
*  Yeah, you should be allowed to investigate a little bit [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7616.68s)]
*  Yeah, can Infinity pick that up for us [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7618.68s)]
*  How about this, Infinity? [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7620.68s)]
*  Tell us where the fucking serial killers are [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7622.68s)]
*  That would help everybody out [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7624.68s)]
*  Way more [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7626.68s)]
*  You know, so that would be one more bonus [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7628.68s)]
*  Of that whole thing [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7630.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting thing, actually [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7632.68s)]
*  Like all seriousness, could that help with crime? [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7634.68s)]
*  A lot, I would assume, right? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7636.68s)]
*  Oh, well I think one of the reasons that they're even doing like all this ICE stuff [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7638.68s)]
*  Or their deportations and that sort of thing [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7640.68s)]
*  We're about to get into a surveillance state, right? [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7642.68s)]
*  And so you wouldn't even be able to be [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7644.68s)]
*  Like, technically illegal [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7646.68s)]
*  In America anymore [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7648.68s)]
*  Like you can just see how they're just getting all the paperwork done [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7650.68s)]
*  Like you wouldn't [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7652.68s)]
*  Because we're going to show [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7654.68s)]
*  Soon there will be drones in the sky, there will be things [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7656.68s)]
*  There will be a new system that is just monitoring us at all times [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7658.68s)]
*  They'll just know everything [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7660.68s)]
*  They'll know everything, right? [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7662.68s)]
*  I mean we're already granting that [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7664.68s)]
*  Access to technology, right? [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7666.68s)]
*  There was a part in the [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7668.68s)]
*  Big beautiful bill, I think it just [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7670.68s)]
*  I don't know if it passed both houses [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7672.68s)]
*  Or the Senate and the Congress [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7674.68s)]
*  But US Senate passes Trump's sweeping tax [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7676.68s)]
*  And spending bills setting up house battle [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7678.68s)]
*  So that's going to be interesting [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7680.68s)]
*  JD Vance was the tying vote [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7682.68s)]
*  Or the tie breaking vote, I guess [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7684.68s)]
*  I think [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7686.68s)]
*  This is a bad bill after from what I've learned [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7688.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know much about it, honestly [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7690.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's okay, and I'm sorry for bringing it up [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7692.68s)]
*  No worries [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7694.68s)]
*  But I don't think that it's [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7696.68s)]
*  You know, I learned one thing about these bills [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7698.68s)]
*  They're like omnibus bills, right? [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7700.68s)]
*  So instead of there just being like one bill [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7702.68s)]
*  And so everybody votes on it, like hey, what do you think about this [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7704.68s)]
*  Higher taxes for this tax bracket? [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7706.68s)]
*  And you'd be like [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7710.68s)]
*  Everybody could vote no one or everybody could vote yes [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7712.68s)]
*  But they'll be like, what do you think about this [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7714.68s)]
*  And that's just, that would be one bill [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7716.68s)]
*  But an omnibus bill is a bunch of bills at once [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7718.68s)]
*  So it's like, what do you think about this [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7720.68s)]
*  Higher tax bracket [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7722.68s)]
*  But also [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7724.68s)]
*  What do you think about [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7726.68s)]
*  We give [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7728.68s)]
*  Extra stipends [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7730.68s)]
*  To people that served in the military [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7732.68s)]
*  So you only get to [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7734.68s)]
*  Vote yes or no though [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7736.68s)]
*  Oh [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7738.68s)]
*  So that's how they get it [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7740.68s)]
*  So it's got to be a two for one, that's how they get the [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7742.68s)]
*  Things they want, right, if you hear the military [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7744.68s)]
*  Like oh, I want to vote for that, but then you're also voting for the other thing [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7746.68s)]
*  Interesting, and there's like [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7748.68s)]
*  Seven or eight of those sometimes in a bill, and there could be [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7750.68s)]
*  I don't even know how many, but sometimes there's a lot [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7752.68s)]
*  And then if [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7754.68s)]
*  You say you or somebody that votes against it [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7756.68s)]
*  You're like, I'm voting no because I don't want my people to have higher [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7758.68s)]
*  Tax, sure it's going to affect [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7760.68s)]
*  This thing in the military, but then [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7762.68s)]
*  The other campaigns will run [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7764.68s)]
*  Commercials against you, he voted no [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7766.68s)]
*  On money for the military [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7768.68s)]
*  I could hear those, yeah [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7770.68s)]
*  All those shitty local political commercials [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7772.68s)]
*  But they don't say in that commercial, he voted yes [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7774.68s)]
*  On saving his people from like [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7776.68s)]
*  Raising taxes [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7778.68s)]
*  So that's how it's all done dude, it's this whole [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7780.68s)]
*  Fucking tricky system, and it's called [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7782.68s)]
*  Omnibus bills, and [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7784.68s)]
*  Anyway, I just learned about that [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7786.68s)]
*  So it's bad, I never knew it either [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7788.68s)]
*  Because it always seems like, well why wouldn't they [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7790.68s)]
*  Because nothing ever gets done [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7792.68s)]
*  That's why I don't pay attention to it [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7794.68s)]
*  Nothing happens [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7796.68s)]
*  Shit's so bad, Joey Chesada had to come back [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7798.68s)]
*  To fucking America [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7800.68s)]
*  He had to stop making his vegan money [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7802.68s)]
*  He had to come back [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7804.68s)]
*  And start slurping dogs [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7806.68s)]
*  Again, dude [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7808.68s)]
*  Oh man, he was at a fanatics fest last week killing it [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7810.68s)]
*  Did you see him? [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7812.68s)]
*  Did you guys go? Yeah, we went to fanatics fest [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7814.68s)]
*  With Meta again, we were rocking our glasses [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7816.68s)]
*  And he had [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7818.68s)]
*  Todd Graves had him do a [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7820.68s)]
*  It was Todd, Livi, Don, and Druski [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7822.68s)]
*  Against Joey Chestnut in a chicken [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7824.68s)]
*  Tender eating contest [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7826.68s)]
*  In a Canes contest [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7828.68s)]
*  Joey Chestnut's laps, celebs, and chicken eating [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7830.68s)]
*  Contest, sorry Livi [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7832.68s)]
*  Oh and they had DJ Khaled too, he was against [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7834.68s)]
*  DJ Khaled as well [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7836.68s)]
*  You'd think he'd take one of those fucking wings [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7838.68s)]
*  And just take it out of his mouth for a second and speak up for his [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7840.68s)]
*  Home country, but no, that's just who he is [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7842.68s)]
*  Go on [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7844.68s)]
*  That's a funny image of DJ Khaled looking at him in disbelief [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7846.68s)]
*  Look at him taking those tendies [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7848.68s)]
*  You guys have to dip those tendies [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7850.68s)]
*  Well that's the whole thing, man [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7852.68s)]
*  That was a fun week, that was cool [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7854.68s)]
*  I met my childhood hero [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7856.68s)]
*  I was very, very intimidated [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7858.68s)]
*  Who was he? Henrik Lundqvist [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7860.68s)]
*  He used to be a goalie for the Rangers [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7862.68s)]
*  He's literally still on my wall [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7864.68s)]
*  He's my number one person ever [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7866.68s)]
*  Caleb is from North Carolina, doesn't give a fuck about hockey [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7868.68s)]
*  So if he eventually stopped [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7870.68s)]
*  He's a stud, he eventually grabbed him and was like [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7872.68s)]
*  I'm sorry, could you come meet my friend for a second [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7874.68s)]
*  And I was like yes please, thank god [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7876.68s)]
*  And it was one of the happier moments I've had [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7878.68s)]
*  I used to go to the mall to do his [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7880.68s)]
*  Signings [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7882.68s)]
*  Lundqvist? Yeah, yeah [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7884.68s)]
*  He's a beast, when I was a child [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7886.68s)]
*  My first Ranger game was his second game ever [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7888.68s)]
*  When I was nine years old, I just always loved him [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7890.68s)]
*  That was a big moment for me [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7892.68s)]
*  That made my year [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7894.68s)]
*  You guys just had the first round draft pick, didn't you? [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7896.68s)]
*  The Islanders did, they had the first overall pick [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7898.68s)]
*  So I'm very anti-Islanders [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7900.68s)]
*  Even though I live on Long Island, my whole family is from Queens [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7902.68s)]
*  So we're all Rangers fans [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7904.68s)]
*  I hated the Islanders so much, my high school I went to was down the block [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7906.68s)]
*  From the Islanders arena [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7908.68s)]
*  And I didn't want to go to that high school because of that [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7910.68s)]
*  But I did go because of my friends [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7912.68s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not a fan of them [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7914.68s)]
*  But I love the Rangers and love Henrik, so that was a big moment for me [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7916.68s)]
*  My heart's beating right now thinking about it [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7918.68s)]
*  I walked by him like three times [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7920.68s)]
*  I kept hitting Caleb, Henrik, Henrik, Henrik [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7922.68s)]
*  And finally he did it [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7924.68s)]
*  That is pretty cool, huh? [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7926.68s)]
*  I was praying someone there, because one of my buddies was there, Matt [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7928.68s)]
*  Who's a sports agent, and he was there [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7930.68s)]
*  And I was telling him, dude, I got to meet Henrik [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7932.68s)]
*  He's my guy, I'll introduce you [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7934.68s)]
*  I was like, can you please introduce me at some point [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7936.68s)]
*  Just be like, hey, this guy's a good guy [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7938.68s)]
*  But we didn't, Caleb just had to go up there [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7940.68s)]
*  Caleb had to raw dog it [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7942.68s)]
*  But thankfully he did raw dog it [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7944.68s)]
*  Dude, at the UFC fights, so I'm back [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7946.68s)]
*  We were backstage or something [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7948.68s)]
*  And this is a place you can go back there and get a coffee [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7950.68s)]
*  And you can go back there and get a coffee and use the restroom really fast [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7952.68s)]
*  And you try to stay out of people's way [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7954.68s)]
*  Because these are the most dangerous guys in the world coming through [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7956.68s)]
*  Getting ready to do their most dangerous thing [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7960.68s)]
*  Yes, so I went back there [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7962.68s)]
*  And there was this guy [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7964.68s)]
*  And I thought it was Steve Amiochuk, right? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7966.68s)]
*  He's a famous fighter that just retired [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7968.68s)]
*  And so I asked two UFC employees [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7970.68s)]
*  I was like, is that? [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7972.68s)]
*  Who is that? [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7974.68s)]
*  And they both said, that's Steve Amiochuk, right? [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7976.68s)]
*  And I'd met him a couple times before [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7978.68s)]
*  And he had glasses on when I met him [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7980.68s)]
*  And this guy didn't have glasses on [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7982.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh, maybe he's just, you know, retiring [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7984.68s)]
*  And his eyes are getting better because he just retired [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7986.68s)]
*  Maybe his eyes have been getting better [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7988.68s)]
*  Since he's not getting beaten in the head or whatever [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7990.68s)]
*  So I went over and I was like, what's up, man? [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7992.68s)]
*  You know? [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7994.68s)]
*  I was retiring, and I kind of fucking [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7996.68s)]
*  I don't want to say tickled him a little bit [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=7998.68s)]
*  But I kind of went like that [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8000.68s)]
*  Like something I shouldn't have done, you know? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8002.68s)]
*  Or just like, no, nothing crazy [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8004.68s)]
*  One hand, if you two hands [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8006.68s)]
*  Soldier [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8008.68s)]
*  Yeah, like, good to see you, daddy [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8010.68s)]
*  Welcome home, boy, welcome home from war [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8012.68s)]
*  And he kind of [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8014.68s)]
*  He was like, huh? [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8016.68s)]
*  And I could feel it fucking get everything switched [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8018.68s)]
*  Really quick [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8020.68s)]
*  And I was like, what's up, Stipe? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8022.68s)]
*  How was retirement? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8024.68s)]
*  And then that's when I realized it was not him [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8026.68s)]
*  And his wife was right there [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8028.68s)]
*  And I was like, oh, fuck [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8030.68s)]
*  I was like, how do the people [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8032.68s)]
*  Who work here not even know? [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8034.68s)]
*  Twice [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8036.68s)]
*  Two times to make sure [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8038.68s)]
*  Anyway, it was Jan Blokovic [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8040.68s)]
*  That sounds way scarier than [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8042.68s)]
*  Stipe Maitresh [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8044.68s)]
*  And he ended up cutting me some slack about it [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8046.68s)]
*  And then he even made a joke about it later [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8048.68s)]
*  But anyway [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8050.68s)]
*  Sometimes you're just like [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8052.68s)]
*  That's a scary thing sometimes about being around those places [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8054.68s)]
*  Because there's some real [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8056.68s)]
*  And I've never heard that guy's name [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8058.68s)]
*  Jan Blokovic, bring him up [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8060.68s)]
*  A UFC fighter that I don't know sounds scarier than [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8062.68s)]
*  A UFC fighter you do know [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8064.68s)]
*  Like the [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8066.68s)]
*  The hard-nosed dogs that the casual fan does not know [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8068.68s)]
*  Sounds scary [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8070.68s)]
*  Stipe, I've heard of him, Cleveland legend, I believe [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8072.68s)]
*  And look at it just a general picture [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8074.68s)]
*  If you saw one and the other [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8076.68s)]
*  Those are very similar [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8078.68s)]
*  Similar enough, and both [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8080.68s)]
*  Amazing fighters [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8082.68s)]
*  Let me look at Blokovic's history [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8084.68s)]
*  Blokovic [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8086.68s)]
*  His fight history real quick [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8088.68s)]
*  Is he Russian, I assume? Or Polish? [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8090.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, Polish power [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8092.68s)]
*  He fought Izzy, beat Izzy [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8096.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's when Izzy tried to move up [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8098.68s)]
*  Dude, he was former light heavyweight champion [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8100.68s)]
*  Jan Blokovic [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8102.68s)]
*  Right there, beautiful wife [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8104.68s)]
*  Anyway, great guy, Sarayan [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8106.68s)]
*  And Stipe, I hope retirement's going well [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8108.68s)]
*  Yes, Stipe, Cleveland legend [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8110.68s)]
*  I know that about him [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8112.68s)]
*  I know he's a Cleveland legend [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8114.68s)]
*  Dude, he can come out and support the women's basketball team [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8116.68s)]
*  Yeah, definitely [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8118.68s)]
*  Cleveland, Cleveland, underrated city [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8120.68s)]
*  Yeah, oh dude, Cleveland is great [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8122.68s)]
*  I love the mall that they have down there [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8124.68s)]
*  Have you been in that old mall that they're refi- I think they're refi- [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8126.68s)]
*  Is there like a hotel in it? [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8128.68s)]
*  I stayed in that hotel one time [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8130.68s)]
*  Me too! [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8132.68s)]
*  The comedy clubs that always put us up there [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8134.68s)]
*  Me and my parents had like a road trip to Chicago [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8136.68s)]
*  We stopped in Cleveland and stayed at the hotel [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8138.68s)]
*  In the mall [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8140.68s)]
*  Cleveland's a cool city, I like it, underrated [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8142.68s)]
*  That's a bad rap, and Cincinnati [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8144.68s)]
*  I think both underrated cities [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8146.68s)]
*  Well, Glenny Mann, I'm just good to see you, dude [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8148.68s)]

*  Aside from being a larger gentleman myself [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8170.68s)]
*  I do actually enjoy food, food's awesome [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8172.68s)]
*  I just don't like just eating it [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8174.68s)]
*  I don't like eating too much of it even, I'm at the stage of my life where I like to taste [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8176.68s)]
*  I'd rather every place I go to just be a tasting venue [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8178.68s)]
*  Just have a few bites of each thing [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8180.68s)]

*  Yeah, and um- [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8190.68s)]
*  If you had your own series of Airbnbs where people could go [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8192.68s)]
*  And they were like, everything from you guys' vibes maybe [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8194.68s)]

*  Tap out, can I burst your bubble here? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8202.68s)]
*  I'm not the biggest olive person [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8204.68s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I'm a bad Greek [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8206.68s)]
*  I don't love olives, I don't go crazy for them [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8208.68s)]
*  What about black olives? Dude, they've been through a lot [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8210.68s)]
*  I like black olives, they're good by me [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8212.68s)]
*  I don't like Kalamata olives, those are gross [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8214.68s)]
*  Or February olives as some people call them [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8216.68s)]

*  I get the olive, I just have them there for the aesthetic [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8220.68s)]
*  I don't even eat them [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8222.68s)]
*  I just leave them there [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8224.68s)]
*  People usually feed them to the drunk girl at the bar [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8226.68s)]
*  There's always that drunk girl that's had like 60 olives [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8228.68s)]

*  The olive-cato [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8246.68s)]
*  An avocado olive child? [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8248.68s)]
*  Yeah [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8250.68s)]
*  Enlighten me [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8252.68s)]
*  That's what it is, because olives are kind of salty a little [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8254.68s)]
*  And avocados, they always had a little more salt in them [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8256.68s)]
*  The olive-cato [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8258.68s)]
*  Ooh [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8260.68s)]
*  They've done food stuff like that before [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8262.68s)]
*  They've done all things [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8264.68s)]
*  They do it with dogs [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8266.68s)]
*  Can I give you a business idea that I've always thought about? [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8268.68s)]
*  Or want your take on it? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8270.68s)]
*  Fully clothed strip club [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8272.68s)]
*  I've always said I have two business ideas [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8274.68s)]
*  Fully clothed strip club and fat only gym [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8276.68s)]
*  Only fat people could go [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8278.68s)]
*  And then when you finally lose the weight [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8280.68s)]
*  You could still go to the gym [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8282.68s)]
*  And you could be inspiration for the other fats there [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8284.68s)]
*  Ooh I love that [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8286.68s)]
*  Ooh I love that [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8288.68s)]
*  And it would be like 40, you could wear a shirt [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8290.68s)]
*  You could get a necklace or something [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8292.68s)]
*  Like 11 months non-fats [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8294.68s)]
*  You get a picture on the Hall of Fame [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8296.68s)]
*  If you lose the weight you get on the Hall of Fame [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8298.68s)]
*  You're in there when you walk in [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8300.68s)]
*  And you're like, oh look, there's Roger, he's still doing good [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8302.68s)]
*  He's not putting back on, he's doing good [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8304.68s)]
*  So I think that would be a fun idea [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8306.68s)]
*  One day, just do a fat only gym [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8308.68s)]
*  I love that dude [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8310.68s)]
*  I think it's a great idea [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8312.68s)]
*  Fat only gym called Foggy's gym [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8314.68s)]
*  Not a horrible idea [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8316.68s)]
*  Let me tell you, we don't like [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8318.68s)]
*  We don't like going to the gym [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8320.68s)]
*  We don't like being seen by skinnies [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8322.68s)]
*  It's horrible [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8324.68s)]
*  Yeah I think it's interesting what life is like [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8326.68s)]
*  And we're all carrying some different type of thing [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8328.68s)]
*  That makes us feel uncomfortable [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8330.68s)]
*  It's interesting [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8332.68s)]
*  Yeah, especially just being at the gym in general [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8334.68s)]
*  My friends were here actually, we were here like a year ago [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8336.68s)]
*  And they were all going to the gym [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8338.68s)]
*  And I was like, fuck it, I'll just go with them [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8340.68s)]
*  I bought an elliptical at my house [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8342.68s)]
*  We went to [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8344.68s)]
*  You ever went to Quantum over here? [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8346.68s)]
*  It's like a hot girl gym [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8348.68s)]
*  There's all the chicks in there [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8350.68s)]
*  In their hot gym outfits [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8352.68s)]
*  And then there's all these bros in their cool gym outfits [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8354.68s)]
*  And I'm there in [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8356.68s)]
*  N1 shorts and a fucking Mets shirt [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8358.68s)]
*  And looking like an idiot [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8360.68s)]
*  And it was weird, and some people were coming up to me [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8362.68s)]
*  And being like, oh, what's up? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8364.68s)]
*  And giving me a high five, and almost like I could see [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8366.68s)]
*  Tell in the way they're talking [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8368.68s)]
*  That it was like [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8370.68s)]
*  They were trying to make me feel welcome at the gym [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8372.68s)]
*  Because they know I'm not a gym guy [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8374.68s)]
*  And that made me feel so weird [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8376.68s)]
*  It was almost like, oh, keep going, good work [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8378.68s)]
*  I was on the bench and one guy came over and fist bumped me [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8380.68s)]
*  And was like, good to see you here [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8382.68s)]
*  And I was like, oh [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8384.68s)]
*  Like when an Irish [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8386.68s)]
*  Like when a British guy [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8388.68s)]
*  Shows up at a dentist or whatever for the first time [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8390.68s)]
*  Yeah, they were just trying [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8392.68s)]
*  They were trying to be nice about it [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8394.68s)]
*  But it was [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8396.68s)]
*  Good to see you, almost like I see you at church for the first time in a while [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8398.68s)]
*  Because they really just want to say [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8400.68s)]
*  Good for you for bettering yourself [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8402.68s)]
*  Is what they really were trying to say in a nice way [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8404.68s)]
*  And it just felt really weird [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8406.68s)]
*  Yeah [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8408.68s)]
*  That was my last time at a hot girl gym [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXLi7QLXzU&t=8410.68s)]
