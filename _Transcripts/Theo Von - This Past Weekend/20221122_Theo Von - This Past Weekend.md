*  What else? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what else has been happening in my life where I where I, you know, things that I could share or I'm seven months sober. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1950.0s)]
*  So that's exciting. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1960.0s)]
*  I know there's a lot of people out there that struggle. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1963.0s)]
*  We get a lot of calls on the hotline and try to return some of them when I can. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1967.0s)]
*  But I want you to know if you are trying to do something different in your life. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1974.0s)]
*  That I can relate to you. That's what that's the thing that you and I probably have in common the most is that you are trying. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1981.0s)]
*  I'm always trying to do something different in my life. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1990.0s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean there's something always wrong with me. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1993.0s)]
*  But I do always want to have some kind of improvement, you know. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=1998.0s)]
*  And I want to get my place self to a place where I can operate pretty comfortably. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2003.0s)]
*  And sometimes, you know, that can take some effort really. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2009.0s)]
*  So but if that's anything like you, then I bet we really have that in common. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2012.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2022.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what else happened. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2024.0s)]
*  Oh, well, I don't know if I talked about it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2027.0s)]
*  You know, Caleb Presley faked his own death on me. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2032.0s)]
*  And. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2037.0s)]
*  And he well, he almost died. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2041.0s)]
*  And so at least. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2043.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2045.0s)]
*  He's willing to put his muerto where his mouth is, you know. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2047.0s)]
*  So that at least I respected that. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2051.0s)]
*  But what happened was he was in the hot. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2053.0s)]

*  And next thing you know, he's in the hospital, he's on a ventilator. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2077.0s)]
*  And so I'm on an airplane. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2081.0s)]

*  Either Caleb is. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2171.0s)]
*  Unalive or. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=2176.0s)]

*  But yeah, this guy, you can't see the video. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3251.0s)]
*  He's brought a little shoveler. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3253.0s)]
*  It's like a little motorized shoveler. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3256.0s)]
*  Have like a big shovel when he drives it, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3259.0s)]
*  and he's just basically attacking the walls in this building. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3261.0s)]
*  I love this, and I'll tell you why. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3264.0s)]
*  Because this is where we're at, man. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3267.0s)]
*  This is where we're at. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3269.0s)]
*  If you got insurance, you're covered, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3271.0s)]
*  and somebody gets you down like that, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3273.0s)]
*  they don't do, you get a, do what you got to do, baby. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3275.0s)]
*  And this is one thing that I miss about, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3279.0s)]
*  and honestly, I miss a little about [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3281.0s)]
*  being young, being completely broke, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3285.0s)]
*  having nothing. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3288.0s)]
*  Because when you got nothing, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3290.0s)]
*  they can't, they can't take nothing from you. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3293.0s)]
*  That's when you're the freest you could ever be. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3296.0s)]
*  They go on, you free as can be, you got nothing, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3301.0s)]
*  then they can't take nothing from you. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3305.0s)]
*  You could save, do what you ain't got, no. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3310.0s)]
*  Because you know what happens is, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3313.0s)]
*  if you have something, they say something, people sue you. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3315.0s)]
*  They come out, they trick you. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3318.0s)]
*  They trick everybody. They'll find a way. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3319.0s)]
*  So then you're like, dang, I want to say something, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3324.0s)]
*  but I like this, having this new, this sofa. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3327.0s)]
*  You know, I want to say something, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3329.0s)]
*  but I got a damn microwave over there. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3330.0s)]
*  I got a damn lava lamp. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3333.0s)]
*  I got a damn microwave that runs in conjunction [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3335.0s)]
*  with my lava lamp. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3338.0s)]
*  I'm making a damn TV dinner, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3340.0s)]
*  and I got a bunch of little, some goop over here [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3342.0s)]
*  doing a damn dougie in the lamp. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3344.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3349.0s)]
*  So, I don't know what I'm talking about, but. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3351.0s)]
*  But that's the time, baby. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3355.0s)]
*  Fuck, you got nothing. Get out there, because let them. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3357.0s)]
*  You know what, they're not going to sue you if you got nothing. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3359.0s)]
*  They ain't going to sue you because there ain't nothing. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3362.0s)]
*  It's a youder winner. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3365.0s)]
*  This is a lawsuit universe now. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3367.0s)]
*  This is insurance nation, baby. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3369.0s)]
*  A teen solo hiker who was terrorized for days [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3372.0s)]
*  by unknown figures dressed in white. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3375.0s)]
*  Two cops who quit their job at a local theater [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3378.0s)]

*  But here we go. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3447.0s)]
*  Let's take a call right here. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3452.0s)]
*  Hi, VO. My name is Megan. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3454.0s)]
*  I'm from California, Los Angeles area. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3457.0s)]
*  Hey, Megan. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3461.0s)]
*  Hey, Megan. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3463.0s)]
*  Onward. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3465.0s)]
*  I'm a new fan, probably like the last six months, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3467.0s)]
*  but I've been watching a bunch of your podcasts [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3471.0s)]
*  and different interviews you've been on with Bobby Lee. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3474.0s)]
*  I love Bobby Lee, too. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3478.0s)]
*  I'm a single mom, and I've been dating a little bit, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3480.0s)]
*  and I just wanted to let you know that... [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3485.0s)]
*  Good for you, baby, to get out there. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3487.0s)]
*  You know, get out there. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3490.0s)]
*  We all have to get out there. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3491.0s)]
*  This is our time. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3492.0s)]
*  You know, I used to... [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3494.0s)]
*  So much of my life, when I look at the past of my life, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3496.0s)]
*  I was afraid to get out there [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3499.0s)]
*  because I don't look the way I want to look. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3500.0s)]
*  I don't, you know... [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3503.0s)]
*  I'm not in my best shape right now. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3505.0s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3508.0s)]
*  But then, damn, as life goes on, it all just gets a little tougher, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3509.0s)]
*  and you never get to the space, the perfect space. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3512.0s)]
*  So the whole time, I'm keeping myself away from joy, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3516.0s)]
*  away from possibility, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3519.0s)]
*  because I just... [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3522.0s)]
*  I'd fear a lot of times, or insecurity. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3524.0s)]
*  I did that a lot. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3526.0s)]
*  I'm not accusing you of that. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3527.0s)]
*  It just... [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3528.0s)]
*  Man, when I look at pictures of myself, even a few years ago, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3529.0s)]
*  I say, damn, man, I wish you'd have more confidence then. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3533.0s)]
*  You know, I wish you went and did the... [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3537.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3539.0s)]
*  But that's okay, because I can try now. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3541.0s)]
*  But I'm glad you're getting out there, man. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3547.0s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3548.0s)]
*  I was doing okay dating before. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3550.0s)]
*  Like, I think I'm attractive, not... [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3552.0s)]
*  True. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3555.0s)]

*  Oh, right? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3639.0s)]
*  I just found out, like, a couple months ago [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3640.0s)]
*  that, like, my dad isn't, like, my actual dad. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3642.0s)]
*  And my mom has just been, like, straight up lying [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3646.0s)]
*  for, like, 18 years to my face. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3648.0s)]
*  And, like, I found it out [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3651.0s)]
*  because I was getting documents for, like, college. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3652.0s)]
*  And it was, like, this, like, medical shit. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3655.0s)]
*  And, like, I checked the name, and all my dad's name, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3657.0s)]
*  it was, like, different. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3659.0s)]
*  And so I got to my mom, and I'm like, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3661.0s)]
*  and I'm like, yo, like, why is it different? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3663.0s)]
*  She goes, oh, it must be, like, a typo. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3665.0s)]
*  Or, like, they messed it up or some shit. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3667.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, all right, then. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3669.0s)]
*  And then, so my friend called me, like, a week later. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3671.0s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, bro, your mom got drunk [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3674.0s)]
*  and told my mom that you're not your dad's son. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3677.0s)]
*  And I was like, yo, what the fuck? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3680.0s)]
*  And so, like, I go on a trip. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3683.0s)]
*  Whoa, so, dude, I feel like the clues are adding up [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3685.0s)]
*  kind of a little. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3689.0s)]
*  I'm sorry to hear this. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3690.0s)]
*  That you're not the dad's son. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3692.0s)]
*  You are not the son. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3694.0s)]
*  You are not the son. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3696.0s)]
*  The dad's like, um, but, bro, are you at the beach or something? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3698.0s)]
*  Because you're like, bro, my dad, you know, he didn't know. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3703.0s)]
*  And I told my mom, she's like, what? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3708.0s)]
*  And then I feel like I'm talking to Chad and JT. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3711.0s)]
*  This could be a Chad and JT prank. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3714.0s)]
*  But I'm going to ride, I'm going to ride. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3717.0s)]

*  So this could be God really doing something powerful for you. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3885.0s)]
*  And I think you got to pay attention to bro. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3888.0s)]

*  Praise brother. Let's hear another call that came in here. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3914.0s)]
*  Um, here we go. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3919.0s)]
*  Hey, my name is Noah. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3925.0s)]
*  I'm just basically calling to let you know that a lot of what you say is pretty much exactly how I feel, man. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3927.0s)]
*  When you talk about being addicted to your emotions, I completely understand that. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3933.0s)]
*  I feel the exact same way. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3936.0s)]
*  I'm in recovery also, and I'm 57 days sober today. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3938.0s)]
*  My man. Congratulations, bro. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3941.0s)]
*  57 days. How wild is that? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3946.0s)]
*  You know, you know how you know how few people in the world have ever done anything for 57 days, especially giving up something we liked. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3950.0s)]
*  Do you guys? It's hard. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3961.0s)]
*  It's it's I'm one day off vaping right now, bro. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3964.0s)]
*  And I want to fucking smoke a bowl out of my own nuts, bro. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3969.0s)]
*  Pure nicotine. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3973.0s)]
*  So it's really magical, man, to see you have in this these 57 days, man. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3976.0s)]
*  Onward. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3982.0s)]
*  This shit just gets overwhelming sometimes, man. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3983.0s)]
*  I thought getting sober would solve most of my problems, but I guess why it's a little bit more complicated than that. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3986.0s)]
*  Now, if I was carried around this anger with me that I can't really put my finger on, you know, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3992.0s)]
*  just a little thing will set me off and dropping something or bumping into something. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=3997.0s)]
*  I'll be screaming in my head for for hours. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4002.0s)]
*  Oh, man, I can really relate to that. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4005.0s)]
*  If there's an inanimate object, I can tell how I'm doing right in the morning. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4008.0s)]
*  I bump into something on the way out of my room. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4012.0s)]
*  And I used to be I'd be so angry. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4016.0s)]
*  I'll burn you. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4020.0s)]
*  I will burn you. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4024.0s)]
*  I will put you in a fireplace. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4026.0s)]
*  You know, I'll just yell that at pieces of furniture. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4029.0s)]
*  But now, you know what I noticed the other day, I'm able sometimes I'll go. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4033.0s)]
*  I'm able to laugh because I don't see that the fact that I bumped into something, I don't see it as any reflection of who I am. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4040.0s)]
*  Or any reflection that the world is trying to get me. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4048.0s)]
*  Or the world is angry at me. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4052.0s)]
*  And I only say that just to say that it can those feelings of anger you still have, it can adjust. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4055.0s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4062.0s)]
*  Now, I'd like to say that if someone else spoke to me the way that I speak to myself, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4064.0s)]
*  I'd have to kill that son of a bitch because I couldn't tolerate that. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4068.0s)]
*  I don't know why we're just so mean to ourselves, man. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4072.0s)]
*  I don't know why I get so addicted to things. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4075.0s)]
*  I'm even addicted to damn nasal spray. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4078.0s)]
*  That's about the hardest thing I've had to kick the shit out of this with you. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4081.0s)]
*  Man, I appreciate your honesty here. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4086.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, I had a non-addictive nasal spray that I had for a while that I sometimes I pull up if I was going to a bar or something, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4090.0s)]
*  I'd do a shit in each nose before I go in. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4099.0s)]
*  It didn't even do anything to me. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4102.0s)]
*  It gave me a little bit of a flashback of probably doing a drug or something. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4104.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4109.0s)]
*  And just kind of heightened my senses in a weird way or... [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4110.0s)]
*  But yeah, man, I'm sorry that you are so mean to yourself. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4117.0s)]
*  You know, and I don't mean that as a reflection of who you are because I know, like me, you don't want to be. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4123.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4131.0s)]
*  You don't want to be. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4132.0s)]
*  But if you're like us, you have some of this that we have, this ism, this alcoholism, this uncomfort. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4136.0s)]
*  It's really an uncomfort that just lives in us. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4148.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably going to be real hard on yourself. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4154.0s)]
*  You know, I think I was always extremely hard on people. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4160.0s)]
*  That's the number one note people have given me. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4163.0s)]
*  Now, you're so hard on yourself. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4166.0s)]
*  And I think I used to think that if I wasn't hard on myself, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4171.0s)]
*  then nobody was... [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4183.0s)]
*  Let me think about this. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4185.0s)]
*  If I wasn't hard on myself, because when I was young, nobody was anything on me, you know? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4187.0s)]
*  And so I thought maybe if I was hard on myself or maybe if I was perfect... [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4196.0s)]
*  You know, I used to think... [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4202.0s)]
*  I realized this the other day. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4203.0s)]
*  I used to think that... [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4204.0s)]
*  Well, I expected myself to be perfect. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4209.0s)]
*  So then I would never was because it's impossible. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4211.0s)]
*  So then, therefore, I'm so hard on myself, you know? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4213.0s)]
*  Because I thought that I wasn't cared for as a child, and I'm not trying to self-pity. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4217.0s)]
*  I'm just looking at what was a part of my life that I wasn't cared for as a child. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4223.0s)]
*  So therefore, I took it on myself. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4229.0s)]
*  Oh, if I was better, if I was perfect, then I would be loved. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4231.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not perfect enough. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4236.0s)]
*  I'm not good enough. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4239.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not good enough for my mother to see me. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4241.0s)]
*  I'm not good enough for my father to stay alive. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4244.0s)]
*  I had this epiphany not long ago that I thought that if I was better, if I was perfect, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4250.0s)]
*  if I did everything right as a kid, I thought this. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4258.0s)]
*  I didn't know until just recently that I thought it, but it came up. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4261.0s)]
*  That if I did everything right, that my father would stay alive. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4265.0s)]
*  That's what I thought for some reason as a kid. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4269.0s)]
*  You know, nobody explained to me what was going on or how things worked or that I was getting, you know, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4274.0s)]
*  I just knew my dad was older and that he was not going to be alive for a long time. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4281.0s)]
*  And as a child, I thought maybe if I'm perfect, if I'm perfect, you know, that my life would be different. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4284.0s)]
*  You know, and more specifically that my dad would stay alive. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4294.0s)]
*  I thought that. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4297.0s)]
*  I don't know how I came up with that or what made me think that as a kid. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4298.0s)]
*  But at least then it gave me some control over what or what was going to happen. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4302.0s)]
*  Because now it's some of it's something it's up to me, you know, even though it's not realistic, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4308.0s)]
*  it's impossible for that to come to fruition, but it's up to me then. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4316.0s)]
*  So that's why I think I was so hard on myself a lot of times, I think, because then at least it puts it on me. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4321.0s)]
*  Which was the only thing that I felt I could try and rely on anyway, because I didn't feel comfortable in the world. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4332.0s)]
*  And that's not some down. I'm not trying to downer anybody. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4342.0s)]
*  But I thought about that. Let's hear more, brother. Thanks for the call. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4345.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's enough for me, man. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4348.0s)]
*  I just wanted to tell you thanks and that you want to learn, man. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4349.0s)]
*  You know, it's a ton of days where your podcast was the only time I smiled that day. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4352.0s)]
*  So keep doing the Lord's work, man. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4356.0s)]
*  Take care of yourself again. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4358.0s)]
*  Thanks, bro. You too, man. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4362.0s)]
*  You know, I'm proud of you, dude. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4364.0s)]
*  It's hard, you know. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4365.0s)]
*  I'm proud of you. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4372.0s)]
*  I'm proud of you. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4374.0s)]
*  I'm proud of you because I know how hard it is to take care of ourselves. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4378.0s)]
*  You know, I know how hard it is to take care of ourselves. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4384.0s)]
*  I know that for me, I never wanted to take care of myself because if I took care of myself, then I was doing somebody else's job. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4386.0s)]
*  Instead, I wanted to show I just always wanted to show you how much I was hurting, you know. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4398.0s)]
*  And so starting to take care of myself was doing the opposite of that. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4406.0s)]
*  And it was the opposite of the whole thing that I like. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4409.0s)]
*  Oh, you're going to see when you look at me, you're going to see how much I hurt, you know, and starting to take care of myself is the total opposite of that. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4412.0s)]
*  So I hear that in you today, and I'm thankful for that, man. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4421.0s)]
*  I really am. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4424.0s)]
*  And I'm grateful that I have moments like this. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4425.0s)]
*  These are moments that mean something to me, you know, two guys being trying to be honest and not even being gay and just being honest. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4427.0s)]
*  Because these are moments I never had as a child. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4438.0s)]
*  I never had there was never any peace in my house. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4440.0s)]
*  There was never a chance for anybody even to listen to me. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4442.0s)]
*  I never had that. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4445.0s)]
*  I never had that. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4446.0s)]
*  There was never any peace in my house. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4447.0s)]
*  There was never a chance for anybody even to listen or to be heard. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4448.0s)]
*  There was never even any piece of space to think or to feel. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4453.0s)]
*  There was no space for that. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4457.0s)]
*  And so it's moments like this, you know, where I can have an honest conversation with somebody. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4462.0s)]
*  I'd have given anything, you know, to have these as a child. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4467.0s)]
*  And children need these sort of things. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4470.0s)]
*  So anyway, bro. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4473.0s)]
*  Yeah, enough fucking enough of that shit for me to bro. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4474.0s)]
*  But praise, man. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4477.0s)]
*  I'm happy for you and happy Thanksgiving, man. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4478.0s)]
*  You made my day. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4481.0s)]
*  You really did, brother. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4482.0s)]
*  Praise God. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4483.0s)]
*  Let's hear what else we got, man. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4485.0s)]
*  And don't get don't give up, dog. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4491.0s)]
*  Stay in there. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4492.0s)]
*  Fifty seven, man. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4493.0s)]
*  Stay in there, baby. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4494.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4499.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4500.0s)]
*  Hey, deal. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4503.0s)]
*  What's up, man? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4504.0s)]
*  This is Robert calling out of Fort Worth. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4505.0s)]
*  What's up, Robert? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4507.0s)]
*  Out of Fort Worth, baby. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4509.0s)]
*  I love Texas. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4510.0s)]
*  It's a good place. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4512.0s)]
*  And that's great, man. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4515.0s)]
*  Fort Worth. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4517.0s)]
*  I've been down there. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4518.0s)]
*  I used to go down there to Randy Butler's Comedy Room, one of my favorite comedy rooms [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4519.0s)]
*  they used to have down there. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4522.0s)]
*  Can't remember the name of it offhand, but God, he had a great name. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4523.0s)]
*  But God, he had probably the best. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4528.0s)]
*  I mean, he might have the best comedy room in the country when they used to have it. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4531.0s)]
*  It was underground over there in Fort Worth. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4535.0s)]
*  And you get your little comedy on there and get your little liquor and even get your little [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4538.0s)]
*  leg or a little titty sometime afterwards out there. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4542.0s)]
*  Meet you somebody. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4545.0s)]
*  Praise God, brother. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4546.0s)]
*  Onward. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4547.0s)]
*  Big fan. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4548.0s)]
*  Anyways, well, I have a question, man. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4549.0s)]
*  And I know you have a lot of comedy stuff, a lot of funny stuff, which I watch for, but [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4552.0s)]
*  I have like a serious question. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4556.0s)]
*  Okay, so here it is. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4557.0s)]
*  So me and my fiance, we've been together for about six months, seven months. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4558.0s)]
*  And well, she has some court dates coming up and she's facing some time. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4563.0s)]
*  She's facing about eight years. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4568.0s)]
*  Now, I don't know if I should, I mean, I really don't know what I should do. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4570.0s)]
*  Should I break it off before she goes or should I wait for her for eight years or what should I do, man? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4573.0s)]
*  I mean, I really, really love her. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4581.0s)]
*  She's a really good woman. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4582.0s)]
*  And we have a lot of good times together, man. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4584.0s)]
*  But, you know, I'm a man and not only because I had needs because it's not even about that. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4586.0s)]
*  It's just about the, you know, I mean, that's a long time to wait. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4590.0s)]
*  I mean, she might not do a full eight, but she'll probably do, I don't know, maybe two, three, four or five years. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4594.0s)]
*  Bang, baby. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4598.0s)]
*  Gang, baby. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4600.0s)]
*  Crime, you know, and this is a crime call. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4602.0s)]
*  You know, and this is where hopefully she got what Morgan and Morgan are. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4607.0s)]
*  They do good attorney work. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4610.0s)]
*  I don't know who she got getting her the years or getting out of them or whatever. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4613.0s)]
*  But I'll say this, man. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4616.0s)]
*  First of all, how the times have changed. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4621.0s)]
*  This is a call you would hear during a war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, three. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4624.0s)]
*  When people, when wives, their husband going off to military or they're in a POW camp, what do I do? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4631.0s)]
*  They call in, you know, on the ring phone in the D. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4638.0s)]
*  You know, what do I do? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4642.0s)]
*  Do I wait for Andy? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4643.0s)]
*  Do I wait for Ricardo? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4645.0s)]
*  I mean, look, it depends on what type of life you want to lead. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4648.0s)]
*  There's something beautiful about waiting for someone. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4653.0s)]
*  There's something romantic about it. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4657.0s)]
*  There's something really perfect about because you get to keep them in this space in your head where they're perfect. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4659.0s)]
*  They can't really do any wrong because they don't have to. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4666.0s)]
*  So it's almost sometimes waiting for somebody can be a sense of control. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4670.0s)]
*  I'm going to wait for you. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4675.0s)]
*  But really what I'm doing, not all the time, but really what I'm doing is I'm going to say I'm going to keep this in a perfect place where it's manageable because I don't really have to interact with it. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4677.0s)]
*  It's almost like something I can just keep on the shelf right here. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4687.0s)]
*  I can communicate with it when I need to. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4690.0s)]
*  I can get what I need from it. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4692.0s)]
*  In some ways, I have somebody to care about, but I don't physically have to have them there. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4695.0s)]
*  I'm not saying you're doing that. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4699.0s)]
*  I'm saying I've done that in my life in relationships. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4701.0s)]
*  But damn, dude, but then also you have to do them conjugal visits or whatever. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4707.0s)]
*  Or you have to sneak over there at night and just Andy do frame your wiener through that chain link fence and let your girl at Molly or whatever her name is over there not be off over there for the spotlight hits you. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4711.0s)]
*  Because I can't ejaculate under a sheer spotlight. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4727.0s)]
*  Anything over probably 120 watts, buddy, I can't come, you know, and that's who I am. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4730.0s)]
*  But if there's a strong if, you know, if I'm getting the H.J. in a boat pulls up or something, you know, or or if they have to even to coal miners walk up while I'm getting a handy brah, I can't. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4738.0s)]
*  I can't eat Jack around more than probably about 120 watts of straight light. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4752.0s)]
*  So, but that's me, you know, that's me. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4759.0s)]
*  And I think it's brave. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4763.0s)]
*  Now, then how far do you want to go? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4764.0s)]
*  Do you want to make her stuff and mail her things? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4767.0s)]
*  Do you want to have an apron also? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4770.0s)]
*  Because I'm sure there's a whole club of men, men who love prison women. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4773.0s)]
*  Let me look at a man who love prison women. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4779.0s)]
*  Couldn't. Oh. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4785.0s)]
*  Let me see. Husbands of imprisoned. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4791.0s)]
*  Women. They killed their husbands now in prison. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4797.0s)]
*  That's not you, man, because you're calling in. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4803.0s)]
*  I don't know. I get it. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4809.0s)]
*  You know, you I'm sure you could get some information about this. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4810.0s)]
*  But look, I think it's admirable of you. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4813.0s)]
*  You know, men used to go off to war and the women would wait for them. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4815.0s)]
*  You know, and I think if your baby birds over there in prison. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4820.0s)]
*  You know, and you you can keep your seed in the feeder. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4825.0s)]
*  Then you can wait till she gets out, you know. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4829.0s)]
*  And then also, you may be able to set up a situation with her where you say, look, I'm going to date. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4833.0s)]
*  I love you. And this is I'm going to date you while you're there. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4839.0s)]
*  So then at least you also can be honest with her in case you want to date outside of there. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4842.0s)]
*  You give yourself the opportunity to still fall in love, you know. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4845.0s)]
*  Because then you don't want to have a thing. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4854.0s)]
*  I don't think where you're cheating and having a lie about it. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4855.0s)]
*  That's this. That's when you're skating on dirty ice, baby. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4857.0s)]
*  But praise, brother, I hope you are. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4860.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's really kind of you to even think about that. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4862.0s)]
*  And I think it shows some awareness for who you are as a person. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4865.0s)]
*  And I think as long as you're honest with her about what you're thinking, that's really going to be nice. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4868.0s)]
*  You know, and so bless you, man. And good luck over there. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4873.0s)]
*  Let me see. Let's see here. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4883.0s)]
*  What else we got? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4886.0s)]
*  Hey, good afternoon. It's Andrew from Brisbane. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4889.0s)]
*  Hey, going. Hey, Andrew from Brisbane. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4891.0s)]
*  How are you going, Mr.? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4895.0s)]
*  I've always wanted to call in with something funny, you know, like like the rest of them or something interesting. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4897.0s)]
*  But I was listening to your podcast and you're saying you don't have to call in with something interesting. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4902.0s)]
*  You just call up with, you know, what you do for a living. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4907.0s)]
*  So I'm a milkman. I deliver milk around Brisbane. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4910.0s)]
*  I start working around two o'clock in the morning. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4914.0s)]
*  Thank you for calling, Andrew. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4919.0s)]
*  Any milkman that's working at 2 a.m., bro. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4922.0s)]
*  And you know what I'm saying? We both know what you're doing, baby. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4928.0s)]
*  You know, you said you got this slinging that body milk, son. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4932.0s)]
*  That fucking blue percent. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4938.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about, do you got their balling out in people's gardens? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4940.0s)]
*  Let's hear more. And I finished around eleven o'clock, so I got the whole day to be at home. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4943.0s)]
*  And, you know, I love it. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4948.0s)]
*  And also, I guess that's probably why that's probably why they blame the milkman, because, you know, I'm at home all afternoon. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4950.0s)]
*  While the rest of the blokes are at work, working hard. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4956.0s)]
*  So big ups, big love to you. Love your show. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4959.0s)]
*  Praise, brother. Thank you for calling Australia. I didn't even know you. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4962.0s)]
*  I mean, I guess, yeah, I never even thought about y'all having milk over there. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4965.0s)]
*  But I guess it makes sense. Y'all would have milk. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4969.0s)]
*  But damn, if let me tell you, bro, if you rolling up at somebody's house with a couple of jugs, baby, at 2 a.m., dude. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4974.0s)]
*  That's you a pervert, bro. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4983.0s)]
*  You're pervert, man. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4987.0s)]
*  And I, you know, I think this is God talking through me right now. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4990.0s)]
*  I mean, damn, it's like, I don't know, man, maybe I'm being too mean to you, but I just maybe I don't know. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=4995.0s)]
*  Maybe there's something nice about it. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5003.0s)]
*  You out there this damn fucking leaving people a little bit of yogurt, bro. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5006.0s)]
*  You out there girt and on people girt and, you know, just right, you know, leave a little canister, a girt by the door. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5010.0s)]
*  You out there girt and for mom, girt and for dad or whatever. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5017.0s)]
*  I mean, damn, I don't know. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5022.0s)]
*  I remember the first time I ever even had a little bit of yogurt, bro. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5025.0s)]
*  I thought, damn, somebody's gay, bro. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5028.0s)]
*  You know, not me, but whoever's making it or whatever. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5032.0s)]
*  Somewhere along the chain of command, somebody's gayed out or something on this. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5035.0s)]
*  Because how else they even doing this? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5040.0s)]
*  Putting all of, you know, it was a strawberry. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5042.0s)]
*  So, but good luck over there, bro. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5048.0s)]
*  Stay alive. God bless you, Australia. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5050.0s)]
*  I cannot wait to come there. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5052.0s)]
*  I'm looking to make a trip next, I believe Thanksgiving before Christmas to have like a time over there in Oz to do a few weeks and do some shows. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5053.0s)]
*  Maybe sooner, but I want to come, I think, in the summer, I guess. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5061.0s)]
*  I don't know. What's the best time to come? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5064.0s)]
*  Let me know. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5066.0s)]
*  As well, we're looking to hire somebody who works in videography clips, making good social clips and that sort of thing. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5068.0s)]
*  You can send a DM to the this past weekend producer Instagram account. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5076.0s)]
*  That's the way to do that. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5085.0s)]
*  Let's get one more call here. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5087.0s)]
*  What do we have? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5088.0s)]
*  What's good, bro? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5090.0s)]
*  Marco over here in Las Vegas. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5092.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm a new podcast fan. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5094.0s)]
*  I've seen specials and all, but I didn't know you had a podcast. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5096.0s)]
*  Well, I'm sure you did, but I just never looked it up. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5098.0s)]
*  And, you know, I've been binge watching, you know, with October all the way back in February. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5101.0s)]
*  And I was just the one where you talk about your feelings and your mom. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5106.0s)]
*  You know, I just want to ask how you doing with that? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5109.0s)]
*  Like, how are you feeling? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5111.0s)]
*  How's life been treating you? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5112.0s)]
*  How's your relationship? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5113.0s)]
*  You know, how's the... [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5115.0s)]
*  I know that Iowaska helped you out, helped you see some things, to feel some things. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5117.0s)]
*  But, you know, I just want to see how you're feeling, man. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5122.0s)]
*  I really appreciate the podcast. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5124.0s)]
*  I appreciate everything you do, the way you talk to us, you know, even though, you know, I really talk to it. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5125.0s)]
*  But I feel like you're talking to us, you know. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5131.0s)]
*  Praise God. Gang, gang. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5132.0s)]
*  Gang, baby, thank you. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5134.0s)]
*  Thank you for the question, man. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5135.0s)]
*  This kind of stuff. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5137.0s)]
*  You know, I love thinking about that, this type of thing. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5138.0s)]
*  And, yeah, the Iowaska was very helpful. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5140.0s)]
*  It was tough going through all that. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5143.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a grueling thing. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5145.0s)]
*  It's just until you've gone through it and really done it is... [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5147.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot on your body. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5150.0s)]
*  It's basically, it's a damn... [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5153.0s)]
*  I mean, you're out there and, you know, it's like buds for your emotions. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5155.0s)]
*  You know, you're doing a lot. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5162.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still kind of getting a little bit more clarity on some of it. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5166.0s)]
*  But it's amazing how over time it gets clearer and how over time it still helps me. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5170.0s)]
*  I'm so grateful for that experience. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5180.0s)]
*  I'm... [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5182.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, I didn't get what I needed as a kid. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5186.0s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5190.0s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5191.0s)]
*  And, you know, I realized I've had a tough time growing up in my life. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5193.0s)]
*  I'm a late bloomer. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5200.0s)]
*  And that's okay. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5202.0s)]
*  I had a really tough time growing up in my life. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5204.0s)]
*  You know, and when I was young, when I was a kid, you know, my dad wasn't around. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5208.0s)]
*  And my dad was very old. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5211.0s)]
*  And my mother worked. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5213.0s)]
*  And my mother had sort of an emotional condition where she couldn't... [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5216.0s)]
*  She didn't look at me a lot. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5222.0s)]
*  And she didn't... [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5223.0s)]
*  She didn't con... [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5230.0s)]
*  Like, I didn't know what to do. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5232.0s)]
*  She didn't con... [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5235.0s)]
*  Like, come to me. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5237.0s)]
*  If I was hurt, if I was physically hurt, then she would react. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5238.0s)]
*  But if I was just, like, had some emotional pain or... [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5243.0s)]
*  My mother wouldn't come to me. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5248.0s)]
*  She had a tough time putting her hands on me. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5250.0s)]
*  So that was just how things were, right? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5254.0s)]
*  You know, that was... [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5257.0s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5258.0s)]
*  It's not okay, but that was life. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5259.0s)]
*  But I realized as an adult that I never wanted to grow up. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5264.0s)]
*  I never wanted to grow up. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5270.0s)]
*  I was a late bloomer. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5272.0s)]
*  And I didn't want to grow up. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5273.0s)]
*  And I realized why. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5274.0s)]
*  Because I still wanted to be that kid. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5276.0s)]
*  Because if I grow up... [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5283.0s)]
*  I still wanted to be that kid. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5288.0s)]
*  I still wanted my mother to come around. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5289.0s)]
*  I still was waiting on these things that I didn't get as a child. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5291.0s)]
*  And I was waiting in every sense I could. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5296.0s)]
*  I was trying to stay as young as I could and be... [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5299.0s)]
*  Because once I evolve, once I become an adult, that kid doesn't even exist anymore. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5303.0s)]
*  And he doesn't exist anyway, but there's something inside him. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5307.0s)]
*  It's like, if I can just... [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5310.0s)]
*  Not grow up, then I'll be able to still be this kid. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5313.0s)]
*  And whenever the things come in that I needed, I'll be here together. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5316.0s)]
*  I'll be there to help them. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5321.0s)]
*  But that was never going to happen. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5326.0s)]
*  And at a certain point, me just staying a child forever was... [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5330.0s)]
*  It was just robbing me of becoming an adult. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5334.0s)]
*  And man, it's really hard to let go. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5343.0s)]
*  It's really hard to let go and grow up. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5347.0s)]
*  Because once I do that, that kid doesn't even... [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5351.0s)]
*  He's not even there anymore. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5355.0s)]
*  He's still there deep inside of me, but he's not there waiting. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5358.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying this, I don't need any self-pity. I'm okay with this. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5365.0s)]
*  I have some feelings around it. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5368.0s)]
*  It's a little bit emotional for me to think about. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5370.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5376.0s)]
*  There's more in it. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5378.0s)]
*  And I'll think about some more of it and talk about it more in the future. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5379.0s)]
*  But yeah, if I didn't have that ayahuasca, I would never have gotten that understanding. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5384.0s)]
*  I would have never gotten the understanding that I'm still waiting. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5390.0s)]
*  There's so much in me that's still just a child waiting for what he was supposed to get as a kid. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5395.0s)]
*  Because I couldn't figure it out. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5403.0s)]
*  I couldn't get a look at myself. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5406.0s)]
*  I couldn't get a step back from me to see me enough to say, okay, here's what's going on. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5410.0s)]
*  And ayahuasca really helped me. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5417.0s)]
*  Man, you could look at yourself through a microscope or you could look through binoculars and you can do it all at the same time. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5419.0s)]
*  So that was a real gift. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5426.0s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5428.0s)]
*  Okay, what's up? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5429.0s)]
*  Let me get something more for you guys, man. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5430.0s)]
*  This has been a lot about me and I'm sorry about that. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5432.0s)]
*  Oh, we got a miracle. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5436.0s)]
*  This fella had called. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5437.0s)]
*  He'd jump on a bomb in the war. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5438.0s)]
*  And we were talking about having him on as one of our miracle guests. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5442.0s)]
*  And let's hear a little more. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5447.0s)]
*  He called back. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5448.0s)]
*  The Rat King! [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5450.0s)]
*  Big dog. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5451.0s)]
*  Amen. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5452.0s)]
*  Baby, el rey de rat. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5453.0s)]
*  Just listen to this most recent solo episode, dog. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5455.0s)]
*  And he mentioned me. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5458.0s)]
*  I sincerely appreciate you, brother. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5459.0s)]
*  Sincerely, dude. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5462.0s)]
*  Iwamente, brother. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5464.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5465.0s)]
*  Thanks for everything, man. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5466.0s)]
*  And yeah, man, I did serve in the Marine Corps from 2007 to 2013, dog. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5468.0s)]
*  Obviously, I had to get out because of my leg situation. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5475.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5478.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5479.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5480.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5481.0s)]
*  I'd take a one legged Marine, bro. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5482.0s)]
*  A lot of times over fucking some of these cats is that's it. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5484.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5487.0s)]
*  Somebody's choice, bro. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5488.0s)]
*  I'd take a day off, dude. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5490.0s)]
*  I would take a fucking two arm Marine if he's walking on his arms, bro. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5491.0s)]
*  And he could shoot a gun with his with his dick. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5495.0s)]
*  I'll fuck that dude could run it, bro. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5498.0s)]
*  Gang. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5500.0s)]

*  And I'll stop it right there. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5513.0s)]
*  You thought we're going to leave your number out there. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5514.0s)]
*  That would have been bad. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5516.0s)]
*  Man, you know, I think this is a great place to pull the episode over to the side because, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5517.0s)]
*  you know, just to hear the joy, the ability in your voice to have some joy, man, when [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5522.0s)]
*  you've had such an experience, you know, such an experience, man, of sacrifice and of, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5527.0s)]
*  I'm sure of adjustment and of ways to find gratitude now, which are all things that I [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5535.0s)]
*  think we will talk about you. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5542.0s)]
*  We'll reach out and we'll get it done. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5543.0s)]
*  We'll get you on there. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5545.0s)]
*  And then in the coming, we get another solo episode. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5546.0s)]
*  We'll put you on it, man. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5549.0s)]
*  So we'll figure that out. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5550.0s)]
*  If you know a miracle or someone or you are a miracle somebody, 9 8 5 6 6 4 9 5 0 3. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5552.0s)]
*  If there's something going on you're struggling with, hit the hotline as well. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5561.0s)]
*  Look, sometimes it might take a year to hear back from us. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5565.0s)]
*  Sometimes you might never hear back. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5568.0s)]
*  We do what we can. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5570.0s)]
*  We're going to try to work on it more in the new year about just having maybe somebody [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5572.0s)]
*  on board that that is their job to help moderate because, you know, we're still figuring it [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5578.0s)]
*  all out. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5585.0s)]
*  And look, I'm a late bloomer, baby, when it comes to everything, even with business, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5586.0s)]
*  I didn't want anybody to help me for years. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5592.0s)]
*  I couldn't let anybody help me. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5594.0s)]
*  And now I know I need help. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5596.0s)]
*  You know, I need help on the outside. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5597.0s)]
*  I need help on the inside. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5600.0s)]
*  And that's OK, man. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5602.0s)]
*  But thank you. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5604.0s)]
*  Thank you, Maureen. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5606.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's a sergeant. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5608.0s)]
*  No, Maureen, a corporal. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5610.0s)]
*  Thank you, Maureen, for your sacrifice and for your attitude, even just in that call, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5612.0s)]
*  man. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5623.0s)]
*  I can hear you're excited. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgb9Qi9etBQ&t=5624.0s)]
