*  But yeah one thing that was interesting you got to see all the movie what's the different sections kids adults [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2469.18s)]
*  uh [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2474.54s)]
*  Teens and they had drama violence [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2476.94s)]
*  Horror you go to the little section like oh well look at all these movies, you know [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2479.9s)]
*  uh rambo, you know rambo, uh [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2484.46s)]
*  like a [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2489.0200000000004s)]
*  Rambo remember that [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2490.2200000000003s)]
*  Or they'd have like bad attack and like two, you know dangerous bats attack a family or something and you know outside of des moines though [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2493.34s)]
*  And they're like damn they fucking these bats are getting people damn these bats [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2501.1000000000004s)]
*  um [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2506.1400000000003s)]
*  But the one thing interesting thing I thought about being at the blockbuster was you got to uh [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2508.8599999999997s)]
*  You made a choice you had all the things and you made a choice [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2514.22s)]
*  You went and you were like, oh [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2519.8199999999997s)]
*  This one looks pretty good. I'll make this choice. I'm gonna chew [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2522.2999999999997s)]
*  There was just so many choice you could wander and you could choose like [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2526.06s)]
*  It felt like you had so many options and you got to make a choice [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2531.02s)]
*  Whereas with the streaming platforms now you turn it on the most you can see on a screen at one time is about eight [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2535.42s)]
*  Or ten names [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2540.54s)]
*  And I don't really and it feels like it's the same you could go through every section. They give you the same [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2542.94s)]
*  You know nine options [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2547.82s)]
*  You're like damn [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2550.06s)]
*  So that was one thing that felt interesting at the blockbuster was that I got to make the choice I [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2553.58s)]
*  You know, maybe i'd be in comedy section i'd be looking see you know, let me look over there [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2559.42s)]
*  You know, they got horror films where they got a geriatric. Um [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2564.1400000000003s)]
*  You know nightmare or whatever putting nightmares or whatever [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2568.94s)]
*  And you go over there and look at that [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2572.7000000000003s)]
*  They got construction what you know different shit [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2575.02s)]
*  And one area is just blueprints rolled up. You can read them bitches [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2578.3s)]
*  you know bad blueprints a lot of stuff from probably like, uh [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2582.38s)]
*  Areas where there's like a high water table like damn [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2586.06s)]
*  I don't know [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2588.7s)]
*  So if you know about blueprints some of that shit can be very very scary [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2589.9s)]
*  uh [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2594.38s)]
*  But I just thought it was interesting you got to me I felt so much more like I made the choice at blockbuster [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2597.3399999999997s)]
*  Whereas with the streamer platforms, I feel like the choice is kind of made for you. They're making the choice in the background [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2603.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, they're giving you these here's 12 options choose this is you know [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2610.94s)]
*  But at blockbusters just feel like here's all the options [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2615.66s)]
*  you know, it's like [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2618.94s)]
*  It's like you're in a blockbuster [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2621.98s)]
*  And maybe because that blockbuster you're physically moving so you're kind of wandering through the there's more of a like you doing [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2624.94s)]
*  An action to go choose something [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2632.54s)]
*  I don't know. It was definitely I just felt strongly like man. I miss having the choice [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2636.22s)]
*  As opposed to what it feels like now more is that it gets [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2641.3399999999997s)]
*  Really [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2644.46s)]
*  But the screen it's just you know, it's just such a small screen that they [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2646.62s)]
*  They're gonna they hit you with it enough you might click on it [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2652.54s)]
*  Um, but yeah, it was crazy the new releases and the pete the workers are up there [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=2657.1800000000003s)]

*  Um, it reminded me of my own experience not thinking I had feelings for decades [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3568.96s)]
*  Mommy not decades, but a long fucking time [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3575.44s)]

*  An interaction with my dad where I was just crying [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3585.36s)]
*  And so devastated by something and he was looking at me like I had three eyes like [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3589.04s)]
*  I remember him saying like do you want do you want a beer? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3594.16s)]
*  Do you want a glass of wine? Do you want a glass of dinner? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3597.6s)]

*  Couldn't have this open emotional awareness with us [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3624.16s)]
*  and it's a really [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3628.16s)]
*  Shitty thing to realize and I think it's [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3630.16s)]
*  Kind of like the equivalent of grieving a death [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3633.44s)]
*  like what you might be going through is some kind of grief for [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3637.04s)]
*  Something that you didn't receive in childhood that you needed and didn't have the words to express or know that you needed at the time [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3641.3599999999997s)]

*  Yeah, you know, I think it's tough a lot of us [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3672.48s)]
*  When people we we [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3677.12s)]
*  Well, there's a couple things for one we tend to yeah when people there's so many things that can distract us from our feelings now [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3683.12s)]

*  Um a video game you reach anything [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3702.96s)]
*  To not have this kind of human experience [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3706.72s)]
*  And I don't know how [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3714.8799999999997s)]

*  Especially now with phones. I mean we're just addicted if there's any there's no bigger addiction than a phone. It's just [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3720.96s)]
*  It's almost like we've let electronics beat us kind of in a way or we've let like [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3728.1600000000003s)]

*  And some parents come from a generation where feelings were they didn't there wasn't feelings [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3773.44s)]
*  There was no responsibility [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3779.52s)]
*  We're at such a place in the world, especially in like this capitalist country of america [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3783.04s)]
*  Where [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3790.0s)]
*  Where we're all kind of so satiated [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3793.8399999999997s)]
*  And [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3797.3s)]
*  There's so much less for us to do physically a lot of times that we're fucking sitting around here, you know [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3799.54s)]

*  You know sunbathing in my feelings [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3808.42s)]
*  You know literally just sitting here eating feeling soup it's like i'm just um [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3813.06s)]
*  And i'm not knocking it i'm not but I think a lot of our parents are from a different generation different time [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3818.58s)]
*  You know where things still needed to be done with the daily routine and the responsibility and like [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3826.9s)]
*  um [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3834.02s)]
*  You know people used to have kids because they needed them to help on the farm [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3836.6600000000003s)]
*  That's a few generations ago, but it's not that [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3840.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, it was just a different you would lose more kids in childbirth. It was just there was a lot more [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3843.6200000000003s)]
*  Things were more industrial in some ways [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3852.26s)]
*  And more natural in some ways [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3856.82s)]
*  I think nature and the reality of things was a lot closer [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3861.46s)]
*  Because there weren't so many things to separate you and [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3867.38s)]
*  And people used to get sick and die more there was a re out there was just a reality was so right there [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3874.82s)]
*  Um [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3883.86s)]
*  And now it's like everywhere, you know, there's a medicine for everything everybody stays alive till you know, we live in longer [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3885.3s)]
*  So there's some semblance of [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3894.42s)]
*  That [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3898.5s)]
*  You know, we all have these desk jobs where we're sitting here looking at ourselves and looking at feedback. It's just about us [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3900.02s)]
*  it's just this mental loop where [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3905.54s)]
*  it's probably unhealthy for us and [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3908.1800000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I think we're just in different times. You know, I think it's so I think that's part of it [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3910.9s)]
*  So sometimes our parents they just didn't hey, it wasn't it's not a part of their [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3915.78s)]
*  language [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3920.32s)]
*  I think for some of them, it's not a part of their language [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3922.7400000000002s)]
*  But [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3926.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know this whole this whole experience going through the ayahuasca and trying to stay off antidepressants has been tough [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3928.82s)]
*  Because I just had all these feelings that had never been anywhere they just been stuck in me so it's like [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3937.0600000000004s)]
*  And I could never I always remember asking myself how do I feel about that I could never I couldn't even get a feeling [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3941.86s)]
*  It was always just this kind of comfortable space, you know, we're semi comfortable space [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3950.1800000000003s)]
*  But yeah, thanks for sharing kid [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3957.78s)]
*  I think there's you know, a couple of things at play one where our parents had they they didn't have that [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3959.2200000000003s)]
*  the luxury if it is a luxury [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3964.5s)]
*  Of [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3968.1s)]
*  Of wandering through their feelings so much [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3970.98s)]
*  Um [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3975.7799999999997s)]
*  Because they had to actually deal with stuff on the outside. They had real things to deal with [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3977.38s)]
*  Whereas today on average [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3982.1s)]
*  A lot of that has been [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3984.8199999999997s)]
*  It's pretty comfortable [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3987.22s)]
*  for most people in america [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3989.2999999999997s)]
*  So [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3993.06s)]
*  You're just kind of left like the only the last frontier is inside of ourselves now [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=3995.2999999999997s)]
*  And so that's where some of us are [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4002.02s)]
*  Maybe exploring and then since we're not using our bodies and stuff as much [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4005.62s)]
*  then there's just [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4010.9s)]
*  You know, I think there's like this weird time where we don't [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4014.82s)]
*  A lot of us, you know our nature doesn't know what to do [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4020.58s)]
*  Um, I think there's a weird thing going on where we don't feel of use [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4026.02s)]
*  And so, uh [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4035.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know exactly what i'm saying [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4039.86s)]
*  Um [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOvx6B7sh48&t=4044.2599999999998s)]
