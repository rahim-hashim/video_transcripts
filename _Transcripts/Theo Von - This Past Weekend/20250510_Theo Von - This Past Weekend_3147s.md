*  But yeah, Mother's Day, that's it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=99.68s)]
*  Cause your momma raised you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=106.84s)]
*  Your momma, boy, you were, you was doing nothing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=109.2s)]
*  Your little ass laying there, doing nothing, boy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  Hunting for a fucking hand tit, that's all you was doing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  You was just hunting for that little hand tit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  with your little hands. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  You was a little slurp lord and your mother raised you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  First of all, if something came up to me [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=132.76s)]
*  and started sucking on my breast, on my tit or man, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=134.28s)]
*  or whatever it's called, tit for men or whatever, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=137.84s)]
*  I would not then raise it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=141.48s)]
*  That is, you have to think about that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=144.44s)]
*  If something started sucking on your tit, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=147.48s)]
*  would you take it off and then raise it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  and grow it to its full form? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=152.44s)]
*  Only a mother would do that type shit, boy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  That's some next level. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=158.2s)]
*  That's some next level behavior mothers out there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  With your ass too, a lot of kids never washed they ass. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=164.0s)]
*  We had a buddy, his legs just knew his pants so well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  He wore the same pants always. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  And so you knew good and well [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=173.84s)]
*  so nobody was washing his ass, boy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=175.96s)]
*  Not a chance, even his mom. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=180.84s)]
*  And she tried, you see her warm up some water on a stove [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  in a stove pot and to pull his pants back [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=185.44s)]
*  and just dump it right down the back of his pants. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  Hoping to even to get a half wash or quarter wash [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  on his ass with that warm water. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=195.12s)]
*  But damn, your mother, our mothers did that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=198.0s)]
*  And when we couldn't read, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=203.52s)]
*  imagine you sitting there with somebody, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=204.68s)]
*  And they can't read, you know? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=206.96s)]
*  And you gotta teach them to, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=211.4s)]
*  you start with the first letter and you show them that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=213.84s)]
*  And it's a picture of like an alligator and a little kid [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=219.6s)]
*  and the mom's like, what's that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=221.96s)]
*  And he's like, lizard, lizard. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=223.28s)]
*  Lizard, lizard. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=225.72s)]
*  Or whatever, he can't even say shit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=227.52s)]
*  He don't even say nothing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=229.2s)]
*  He just look at you and try to cop a quick head [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=230.24s)]
*  off that tit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=233.4s)]
*  That's a dumb child. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=235.68s)]
*  We were all dumb child. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=237.04s)]
*  My mother helped us out of that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=240.12s)]
*  Out of that cavern of knowing nothing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=242.4s)]
*  God, they did a lot of work. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=245.68s)]
*  And then even on some, once you were in school [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=250.8s)]
*  when you had to go to school and take a test [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=253.6s)]
*  and you was dumb, buddy, you was damn dumb. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=256.76s)]
*  You was a dumb child. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=261.52s)]
*  And your mother still hugged you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=265.68s)]
*  and said you're gonna do good on it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=267.24s)]
*  I remember my mom would be like, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=271.76s)]
*  you're gonna do great on your test. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=273.28s)]

*  And I would leave out the door [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=281.72s)]
*  and I peeked back in the window [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=283.0s)]
*  where you could see her just shaking her head. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=284.04s)]

*  Oh. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1287.9599999999998s)]
*  And they don't decide until, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1288.8s)]
*  I think it's like a two thirds majority. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1289.9199999999998s)]
*  So like heads up sovereign up or whatever? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1291.6399999999999s)]
*  So if the pope, I guess every day they do it, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1294.56s)]
*  and if the pope hasn't been chosen, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1296.8799999999999s)]
*  they do like black smoke out of the chimney. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1298.1599999999999s)]
*  And then if the pope does get chosen, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1300.8s)]
*  then it's white smoke that comes out of the chimney. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1303.48s)]
*  Oh really, so how long did it take them to choose this pope? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1305.36s)]
*  I think just like two days, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1307.84s)]
*  because yesterday it was black smoke, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1308.72s)]
*  and then two days ago it was black smoke, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1310.84s)]
*  and then yesterday it was white smoke. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1313.08s)]

*  Have we ever had a black pope yet? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1317.64s)]
*  No. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1319.32s)]
*  Wow, bro. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1320.6s)]

*  Big gay. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1325.8799999999999s)]
*  What about an Asian pope, have we had it? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1328.08s)]
*  Oh, we gotta get a damn low Asian pope, boy. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1331.44s)]
*  Just a little bit of prayer fried rice, boy, you feel me? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1337.52s)]
*  I wanna say thank you to mom for having all the answers. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1341.68s)]
*  She had them all. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1346.56s)]
*  She didn't, sometimes they were wrong, yeah, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1347.4s)]
*  but she had them all. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1349.08s)]
*  Imagine something just asking you questions for 18 years [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1351.96s)]
*  and more, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1355.4s)]

*  Yep, that's a mom. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1361.6s)]
*  But this year we're answering for mom, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1364.12s)]
*  and the answer is we're gonna give them flowers [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1368.6s)]
*  plus a real break, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1371.28s)]
*  because moms are at it 24-7. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1374.04s)]
*  And flowers, it's nice, but you know what they really want [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1376.84s)]
*  is a break. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1380.0s)]
*  From everyone's questions, from the endless to-do list, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1382.52s)]
*  from moming. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1386.52s)]
*  Oh, I still ask my mom so many questions. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1388.32s)]
*  I will call and ask my mom what shoe size I wear. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1391.68s)]
*  I could look in my shoe, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1396.64s)]
*  I could do a ruler against my foot, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1398.44s)]
*  but I will call my mom, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1401.76s)]
*  and if she doesn't answer it when I call, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1403.8s)]
*  I will just not know what my shoe size is for the day. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1407.2s)]
*  Oh, if I was a mom, I would just put earplugs in, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1410.92s)]
*  that's what I would do. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1413.8s)]
*  I would tell my kids, I would have one of those lights [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1415.24s)]
*  that taxis have above them, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1417.32s)]
*  on the top of a taxi that says when it's available or not, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1418.84s)]
*  I would turn the light off, not available, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1422.1599999999999s)]
*  and then I would, what would I do if I were a mom? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1425.2s)]
*  Oh, I would get in a big bubble bath. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1429.9199999999998s)]
*  That's what my mom used to do. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1434.36s)]
*  She would yell, she'd yell at us and say something, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1436.52s)]
*  and say we weren't gonna be able to have something, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1440.52s)]
*  then you would hear her slam her door, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1442.52s)]
*  and then every now and then, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1446.24s)]
*  you'd hear her get in that bubble bath right there, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1448.16s)]
*  and maybe crack open a cold beer or something, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1451.96s)]
*  or cold little can of milk or whatever. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1455.0800000000002s)]
*  You'd hear her crack it open and get that bubble bath going. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1457.96s)]
*  Sud, so high, you couldn't see, hear nothing. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1462.0s)]
*  Is she in there? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1464.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what she would, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1466.28s)]
*  and I think she would just sit in there in the bubbles [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  and have a little sip of beer or cold milk. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1470.48s)]
*  Something to get her through the day, man. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1473.72s)]
*  So if I was a mother, I would do that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1475.48s)]
*  Oh, and I forgot to add, this Mother's Day, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1477.3600000000001s)]

*  Yep, that's Theo50, T-H-E-O, number five, number zero, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1499.76s)]

*  It was not a surprise, but you know, she had cancer. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1584.84s)]
*  We thought that she had a little more time. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1588.64s)]
*  But yeah, since then I've spent most of my time [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1591.3999999999999s)]
*  by doing nothing, you know. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1596.08s)]
*  I would visit her grave every day for months, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  which is good, I guess, for getting help. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1603.12s)]
*  He goes and visits her grave every day, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1605.8799999999999s)]
*  you would say, for months onward. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1607.56s)]
*  Man, thank you for sharing this, brother. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1609.8s)]
*  Of my apartment, but I would just let the time pass, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1611.52s)]
*  you know. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1616.72s)]
*  But recently I've started going back to school full time [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1617.92s)]
*  and working again, and honestly, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1624.36s)]
*  I feel like I'm just doing it [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1627.4s)]
*  because it's expected of me, you know, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1628.68s)]
*  from the people around me, my family, my peers. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1631.68s)]
*  I guess another reason for that is I'm pretty young, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1637.36s)]
*  so maybe some people just expect me [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1642.08s)]
*  to move forward pretty fast, but you know, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1644.04s)]
*  I don't want to, you know. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1647.56s)]
*  Yeah, I just, you know, sometimes here I feel like, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1651.12s)]
*  I feel like I was left behind, you know. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1655.12s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for the call, brother. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1658.1599999999999s)]
*  And we discussed this on a previous episode, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1661.6399999999999s)]
*  but we got some calls that came in, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1663.92s)]
*  and I wanted to listen to some of them here, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  just so you can get an idea. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1669.08s)]
*  As always, the hotline got us is 985-664-9503. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1670.32s)]
*  And here's a call that came in about grief. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  We asked callers if they had any suggestions [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1680.68s)]
*  for that gentleman, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1683.96s)]
*  and here's some of the responses that we got. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1685.0s)]
*  Hey, Theo. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1690.76s)]
*  Man, love your show, bro. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1692.52s)]
*  Listen to you every day or every time you make a podcast. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1693.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm actually listening to Pickle Chili right now, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1696.44s)]
*  and I heard the caller call in about he lost [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1699.72s)]
*  his girlfriend or whatever, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1702.4399999999998s)]
*  and you asked some people to call in, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1704.28s)]
*  give some ideas of how maybe he can handle this situation. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1706.32s)]
*  And look, I actually lost my daughter five years ago [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1709.72s)]
*  to this day [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1712.9599999999998s)]
*  from a brain aneurysm. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1716.6s)]
*  And I guess the only advice I can say is like, man, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1718.28s)]
*  don't let nobody tell you how long you should grieve. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1721.1999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be different for everyone, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1723.8799999999999s)]
*  because not every situation is going to be built the same. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1725.76s)]
*  So do it at your own speed, man. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1731.16s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of people [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1735.72s)]
*  that don't want to get involved [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1736.72s)]
*  and tell you how you should do these, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1737.88s)]
*  but you have to experience this the way [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1739.52s)]
*  that you need to experience this to make it right for you. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1742.44s)]
*  I have dreams about my daughter often, man. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1746.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's funny because in my dreams, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1748.88s)]
*  I know she's passed away and I know she's not with her. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1751.08s)]
*  So while I'm dreaming, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1754.76s)]
*  I just try to hug her and talk to her [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1756.4s)]
*  and make that dream last as long as I can. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1759.32s)]
*  And look, miss her. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1765.08s)]
*  Miss her every day. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1766.52s)]
*  I talk to my daughter. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1767.92s)]
*  I miss, I mean, every night before I say a prayer, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1769.24s)]
*  I talk to my daughter and I've been doing that [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1773.4s)]
*  since the day she's passed away. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1775.56s)]
*  And look, last but not least, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1778.02s)]
*  this doesn't get easier. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1781.0s)]
*  It really doesn't. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1782.58s)]
*  It just becomes a new type of normal. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1784.08s)]
*  If that makes some sense, bro. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1786.6999999999998s)]
*  Man, see you, gang gang. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1788.9199999999998s)]
*  Love you, bro. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  Love you too, bro. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1791.76s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1792.6s)]
*  Man. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1794.36s)]
*  Man, that's just... [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1801.0s)]
*  That's all, you know, it's, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1805.9199999999998s)]
*  that's nice of him to call. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1807.84s)]
*  He called out of Louisiana. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1809.08s)]
*  I see that area code 337 over there. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1810.04s)]
*  And you can hear the bayou in the back. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1812.8s)]
*  He just drew it right there. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1814.4s)]
*  Yeah, I remember after my dad was gone, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1818.32s)]
*  even still, sometimes if I'm having a tough day [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1819.96s)]
*  whenever I go to sleep at night, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1821.96s)]
*  I'll, yeah, I'll hope that I get to see him [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1823.2s)]
*  or that he shows up, you know? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1827.4s)]
*  And then sometimes it's like, gets to be further. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1828.84s)]
*  Sometimes it's like further and further between times. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1831.64s)]
*  And then, yeah, and it just like, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1833.76s)]
*  you just wish some, like you hope that somebody will be there. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1837.76s)]
*  But then sometimes they are in your dream. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1840.76s)]
*  And yeah, that's awesome, man. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1843.08s)]
*  That's a really nice sentiment to share. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1845.68s)]
*  Thank you for that call. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1850.28s)]
*  Let's take another call here. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1851.12s)]
*  Hey Theo. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1855.76s)]
*  Hey man, just wanted to call in, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1857.08s)]
*  in response, listening to the Pickle Chili podcast. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1859.44s)]
*  Pickle Chili podcast and the guy. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1865.44s)]
*  Thank you for listening, man. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1869.24s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1870.48s)]
*  Thank all you, anybody who listened. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1871.3200000000002s)]
*  I lost his girlfriend and after five months [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1873.44s)]
*  wanted to respond to somebody that's been through that too. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1877.6000000000001s)]
*  Lost my fiance, high school sweethearts. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1882.0s)]
*  Yeah, day before my birthday, she was in a car accident. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1887.52s)]
*  And it's tough, man. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1891.9s)]
*  Somebody that you've been with for seven years. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1893.56s)]
*  At a young age, I was 21, she's 20. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1897.44s)]
*  So it's kind of rough. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1901.72s)]
*  But just wanted to respond to him [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1904.0s)]
*  and let him know the things that have helped me [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1905.48s)]
*  and maybe it'll help him and somebody else. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1907.6399999999999s)]
*  And the biggest thing is I got all the same symptoms as him. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1909.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, didn't want to do anything. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1915.8799999999999s)]
*  You lose your purpose in life. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1918.44s)]
*  And some things that you touched on Theo, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1920.2s)]
*  you want to dream, you want to feel all that again. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1924.4s)]
*  And it's all true. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1927.68s)]
*  But the thing that helped me the most [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1929.68s)]
*  is surround yourself with friends and family. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  And those things right there, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1936.72s)]
*  the people that love and support you, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1939.0s)]
*  I'm still close with her family. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1940.24s)]
*  And those things help you get through it, man. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1941.92s)]
*  So anytime I'm having those rough days and weeks [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1944.76s)]
*  and you just, like you said, get out. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1948.8s)]
*  And surround yourself with people that love you [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1954.2s)]
*  and your friends, go do some things with your friends. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1956.1599999999999s)]
*  They're always there for you. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1958.3999999999999s)]
*  And I got a dog, you know, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1959.6799999999998s)]
*  and that really helped me get through that too, man. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1961.9199999999998s)]
*  You always got somebody excited to see you when you get home. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1963.8s)]
*  And that's it, man. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1967.12s)]
*  That's really the answer. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1968.72s)]
*  You'll never forget. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1970.24s)]
*  You'll never move on completely. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1971.3999999999999s)]
*  You hope to have a normal life. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1973.96s)]
*  But the things that help you push through it [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1976.84s)]
*  are gonna be just love. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1979.8799999999999s)]
*  Surround yourself with people who love you. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1983.48s)]
*  Amen, man. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1987.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's a song by this guy, Stephen Wilson Jr. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1991.04s)]
*  Thank you for that call [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1995.2s)]
*  and thank you to the caller previously too. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1996.04s)]
*  And thank you guys for both sharing [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1997.8400000000001s)]
*  your experience with loss. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=1999.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's this song, Grief, is that, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2002.0s)]
*  by Stephen Wilson Jr. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2007.28s)]
*  Grief is only love that has nowhere to go. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2010.28s)]
*  And I thought about that. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2017.8s)]
*  I thought about that since that gentleman called in. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2020.52s)]
*  Because love is like, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2025.36s)]
*  love is this feeling that it has to land on someone [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2026.48s)]
*  or an object, it has to land on something, right? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2029.28s)]
*  Like a person, place, it has to, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2032.96s)]
*  love has to have a place to land if you love. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2034.96s)]
*  Like you can love yourself, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2038.08s)]
*  but that's more like integrity and confidence. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2040.08s)]
*  And then it can even drift into ego or whatever. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2045.32s)]
*  But when you really love, you love someone. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2048.24s)]
*  And so love is really, it's an outward thing. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2054.72s)]
*  It's yours, but if it's active, it's not yours. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2059.64s)]
*  It's like a bridge almost kind of. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2064.72s)]
*  And then, yeah, once that recipient is gone, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2070.24s)]
*  once that place where it was landing is gone, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2074.3999999999996s)]
*  it's like, it almost becomes, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2078.52s)]
*  it's crazy that something that is so wonderful [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2081.92s)]
*  can become so painful. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2085.24s)]
*  Because then you have all these same feelings, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2087.3999999999996s)]
*  but they don't have the place to land. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2089.04s)]
*  Yeah, I remember when my father died, I remember. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2094.56s)]
*  I just, I was at his funeral [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2096.72s)]
*  and it was like the most like scariest thing ever. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2099.08s)]
*  There was people there that I didn't even know any of them. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2101.2799999999997s)]
*  And my, this family that I just moved in with, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2105.0s)]
*  the day it took me over there, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2110.3599999999997s)]
*  and some of our neighbors went with me. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2112.48s)]
*  And I just remember like, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2115.04s)]
*  it was all these feelings that I think I didn't even know [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2119.56s)]
*  that I'd had that I wanted to be for my father. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2122.08s)]
*  And I didn't even know I had them. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2125.0s)]
*  And now it was just like, they were, they hit a dam. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2126.96s)]
*  They just would never have a place to go. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2130.04s)]
*  And I just remember like, just so much tears and like, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2132.32s)]
*  crying and like, it would be like, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2136.88s)]
*  going into the cracks of the floor. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2138.7599999999998s)]
*  And I just wanted to, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2140.4s)]
*  I just wanted to be one of those tears. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2142.96s)]
*  I wanted to just disappear. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2144.36s)]
*  Let's take some other calls, man. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2146.12s)]
*  And we're not trying to make, like, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2147.44s)]
*  I guess it can't help but be like sad, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2148.96s)]
*  but I think it's real, right? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2153.48s)]
*  And it's real. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2158.04s)]
*  This is, you know, life is real. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2158.88s)]
*  And it's full of real things. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2161.08s)]
*  And I'm just glad we don't have to go through them alone. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2163.08s)]
*  So that's a nice thought to have right now. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2165.96s)]
*  Hey Theo, how are you? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2168.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm good, how are you? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2170.88s)]
*  I'm good, how are you? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2172.72s)]
*  Hey Theo, I'm replying to the gentleman that [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2175.52s)]
*  had recently lost a girlfriend. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2179.7599999999998s)]
*  I had lost my girlfriend back in 2018. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2183.2s)]
*  So it's going on seven years now. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2186.52s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2192.08s)]
*  And it sounds like he was looking for answers when, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, the only thing that I could say is like, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2199.7599999999998s)]
*  it sounds like he's on the right track. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2203.08s)]
*  And if I was him, I would just choose to live [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2205.0s)]
*  through the memories that they shared together. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2209.8s)]
*  I remember my girlfriend always telling me that, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2214.8s)]
*  you know, she thought I was a good teacher. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2218.0s)]
*  And so now I'm in a field where [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2220.04s)]
*  I'm able to teach people things. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2223.2s)]
*  And I just feel like every time I do, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2224.88s)]
*  I just, it reminds me of her. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2228.7599999999998s)]
*  And there's just like, it's no longer a sadness anymore. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2231.72s)]
*  There's a happiness in it. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2236.0s)]
*  And... [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2241.24s)]
*  You know, it's funny. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2243.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2244.8799999999997s)]
*  Sorry, I'm belting, I had a little bit of Celsius. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2246.52s)]
*  But thank you for the call, man. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2248.2s)]
*  Yeah, I remember my dad. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2253.2s)]
*  Like one thing I, like one of the only things I remember [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2254.6s)]
*  he said to me ever in my life was that I was a survivor. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2256.8399999999997s)]
*  He used to always say that you're a survivor. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2258.8399999999997s)]
*  And maybe he knew that because he was so old [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2261.88s)]
*  that it would be something that I would need, I don't know. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2264.04s)]
*  But it's like one thing that I just feel like, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2266.84s)]
*  you know, I relate to or something. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2274.28s)]
*  You know, like I'm gonna get through this, I guess. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2278.64s)]
*  So I think that's really magical that when you act out [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2282.7200000000003s)]
*  something that somebody who loves you, told you you were, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2285.28s)]
*  when you do those things, that you are kind of servicing [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2288.64s)]
*  that relationship that's no longer there. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2295.52s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2298.68s)]
*  Like if she says that, or you said this part. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2299.92s)]
*  I remember my girlfriend always telling me that, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2303.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, she thought I was a good teacher. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2307.0s)]
*  And so now I'm in a field where I'm able [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2309.04s)]
*  to teach people things and... [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2312.64s)]
*  Yeah, I could totally see that, man. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2315.0s)]
*  That by then teaching that you feel like you're honoring her [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2317.08s)]
*  and it makes you feel that same way that you felt [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2320.7599999999998s)]
*  when she told you it was something that you did really well. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2324.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2330.56s)]
*  It's interesting how we figure out how to keep going [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2331.88s)]
*  in the world, all of us. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2337.44s)]
*  And that we want to, that's one thing [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2342.0s)]
*  that I think is amazing about life. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2343.56s)]
*  Is this will to survive, right? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2346.32s)]
*  It's like you have a man that lost his daughter and he's, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2349.56s)]
*  you know, and there's, it's like he wants to go [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2352.92s)]
*  and at least wake up and see the day every day [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2357.2400000000002s)]
*  because, you know, probably through his eyes, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2359.56s)]
*  his daughter somehow gets to see the day as well, you know? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2362.6800000000003s)]
*  I think there's just something in us [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2365.52s)]
*  that wants to survive so much. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2366.88s)]
*  And I don't even know what to say about that [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2372.1200000000003s)]
*  or what I think about that thought. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2374.04s)]
*  But thank you for that call, man. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2378.64s)]
*  Thanks for sharing that. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2379.7999999999997s)]
*  All right, let's take one more call. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2382.6s)]
*  Hey, Theo. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2385.12s)]
*  This is Tyler from Cincinnati. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2386.48s)]
*  Hey, Tyler, thank you for calling, dude. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2388.84s)]
*  Cincinnati over there. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2390.56s)]
*  Will the Bengals have a decent defense? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2393.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2395.7999999999997s)]
*  All the money's on the offensive side of the ball. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2396.64s)]
*  It feels like if they let Trey Hendrickson go. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2398.6s)]
*  Now with that said, is it a Joe Burrow make or break year? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2401.56s)]
*  We'll see about that, baby. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2406.8s)]
*  Onward, brother. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2408.88s)]
*  I don't have personal experience with a loss [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2410.44s)]
*  of an immediate loved one, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2414.0s)]
*  but I've walked next to someone who has [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2415.0800000000004s)]
*  and our church offers counseling around that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2417.8s)]
*  And one of the resources we use [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2420.88s)]
*  is this book called Dark Clouds, Deep Mercy. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2422.6000000000004s)]
*  I highly recommend it to everyone who is dealing with loss [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2426.76s)]
*  and I buy it for anyone close to me [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2431.88s)]
*  that I hear has a loved one who they've lost [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2433.7599999999998s)]
*  and they've found some peace from that book. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2436.6s)]
*  Yeah, hopefully that can be a resource [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2442.48s)]
*  to some people who are listening. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2444.92s)]
*  Thanks, Spike. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2446.44s)]
*  All right, yeah, thank you for that suggestion, man. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2449.6s)]
*  I know there's a lot of grief books out there and stuff, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2451.84s)]
*  but it's just like, how do you go through it? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2454.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting the young man who called early, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2457.0s)]
*  the first call, the original call was saying [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2460.0s)]
*  that he felt like he got left behind. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2461.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's all kind of fascinating, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2469.12s)]
*  even though it's so sad. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2472.64s)]
*  I was, the other day this, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2481.48s)]
*  I was, the other day this came up on my feed [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2484.6800000000003s)]
*  when I was thinking about grief. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2490.36s)]
*  And it's Jim Carrey once said, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2493.88s)]
*  or this site attributes it to him. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  Grief is not just an emotion, it's an unraveling, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2499.8s)]
*  a space where something once lived but is now gone. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2504.1600000000003s)]
*  It carves through you, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2508.32s)]
*  leaving a hollow ache where love once resided. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2510.1600000000003s)]
*  In the beginning, it feels unbearable, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2513.52s)]
*  like a wound that will never close. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2515.52s)]
*  But over time, the raw edges begin to mend. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2517.8s)]
*  The pain softens, but the imprint remains. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2521.12s)]
*  A quiet reminder of what once was. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2524.48s)]
*  The truth is you never really move on, you move with it. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2528.32s)]
*  The love you have does not disappear, it transforms. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2531.76s)]
*  It lingers in the echoes of laughter [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2534.68s)]
*  and the warmth of old memories [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2536.96s)]
*  in the silent moments where you still reach [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2538.72s)]
*  for what is no longer there, and that's okay. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2540.8s)]
*  Grief is not a burden to be hidden. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2544.48s)]
*  It's not a weakness to be ashamed of. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2546.92s)]
*  It is the deepest proof that love existed. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2549.28s)]
*  That something beautiful once touched your life. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2552.5200000000004s)]
*  So let yourself feel it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2555.4s)]
*  Let yourself mourn, let yourself remember. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2557.2000000000003s)]
*  There is no timeline. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2561.2000000000003s)]
*  There is no right way to grieve. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2563.0800000000004s)]
*  Some days will be heavy and some will feel lighter. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2565.92s)]
*  Some moments will bring unexpected waves of sadness [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2569.32s)]
*  while others will fill you with gratitude [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2572.6400000000003s)]
*  for the love you were lucky enough to experience. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2574.6800000000003s)]
*  Honor your grief, for it is sacred. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2578.1200000000003s)]
*  It is a testament to the depth of your heart. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2581.76s)]
*  And in time, through the pain, you will find healing, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2584.76s)]
*  not because you have forgotten, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2587.76s)]
*  but because you have learned how to carry [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2589.0800000000004s)]
*  both love and loss together. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2590.6000000000004s)]
*  Man, that's pretty powerful. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2593.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, whenever I had heard that quote, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2600.1600000000003s)]
*  that, yeah, that grief is only love [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2601.4s)]
*  that has no place to go. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2603.8s)]
*  It's a great song, too, by Stephen Wilson, Jr. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2604.92s)]
*  I don't believe that the quote is his, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2609.56s)]
*  but it's a great song. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2610.96s)]
*  Yeah, like you have memories, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2616.0s)]
*  and sometimes even just telling a funny story about someone [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2617.36s)]
*  that's gone can almost make you have the same feeling [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2622.8s)]
*  as if they are still alive sometimes. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2627.0s)]
*  But, yeah, thank you guys for, anyway, listening to that. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2634.2s)]
*  I know some of that stuff's kind of heavy [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2639.2s)]
*  and stuff to think about, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2640.44s)]
*  but it's nice to take moments to think about people [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2641.44s)]
*  and just hear what, just be alive. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2645.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's nice to just be alive. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2651.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't mean that. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2653.6s)]
*  I just mean it's, I don't know what I mean. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2654.64s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, thank you everybody [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2658.64s)]
*  who made some calls and called in. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2660.8s)]
*  There was a lot of nice calls and suggestions, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2663.48s)]
*  and we tried to put some together there. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2666.0s)]
*  You know, I wanted to say something. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2671.44s)]
*  There's been something that's just been kind of on my heart, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2672.48s)]
*  and so I feel like I should bring it up. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2674.32s)]
*  There is, I don't know, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2678.32s)]
*  there is, you know, we've had people on the podcast [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2682.0s)]
*  in the past to talk about it, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2685.68s)]
*  and there's just a, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2689.3599999999997s)]
*  there's a conflict that's been happening in the Middle East. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2693.24s)]
*  People know about it between Israel and Palestine [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2695.9199999999996s)]
*  and some of the areas over there, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2701.12s)]
*  the Gaza area they talk about, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2702.4399999999996s)]
*  and I just think it's, it feels to me, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2704.68s)]
*  I don't know if I, it just, it feels to me [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2710.64s)]
*  like it's a genocide that's happening [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2712.8799999999997s)]
*  while we're alive here in front of our, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2714.68s)]
*  in front of our lives. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2719.64s)]
*  And I don't, sometimes I feel like I should say something. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2723.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm not a geologist or a geographer or anything like that, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2728.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, so I don't know a lot of the, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2732.16s)]
*  some of it I do know, though. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2736.3199999999997s)]
*  Like I know the basics of the issues over there, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2737.68s)]
*  but for me it's just like how I feel, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2740.84s)]
*  like you see all these photos of people, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2742.84s)]
*  just children, women, people, body parts, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2748.88s)]
*  just people like putting their kids back together, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2752.88s)]
*  and I just can't believe that we're watching that [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2758.52s)]
*  and that more isn't said about it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2760.72s)]
*  And so I'm not saying anyone else needs to say anything, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2764.0s)]
*  but I think I'm just that more isn't said about it by me. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2766.44s)]
*  So I just, I wanna be able to speak up about that, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2770.28s)]
*  that I think we're watching probably like, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2774.28s)]
*  you know, one of the sickest things that's ever happened. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2778.48s)]
*  And I'm sorry if I've kind of haven't said about it, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2782.16s)]
*  I've tried to talk about it and learn about it, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2786.32s)]
*  but I don't know, maybe I just wanna, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2789.76s)]
*  I just wanted to say something. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2793.04s)]
*  I don't even know what to do. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2794.32s)]
*  And it's crazy because our country is also complicit in it, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2797.12s)]
*  you know, it's in it and has been for a long time. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2800.12s)]
*  And it's just kind of interesting [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2805.28s)]
*  because then you just realize, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2806.28s)]
*  oh, well, I'm just a, yeah, I'm a member of this country, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2807.12s)]
*  but I'm just, what we want sometimes doesn't matter, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2809.56s)]
*  and you just have to be a member of a place [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2815.64s)]
*  and your government is making other choices. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2818.84s)]
*  Um, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2821.56s)]
*  so I don't know if I said that correctly, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2824.56s)]
*  or I don't even know exactly what I said, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2826.88s)]
*  but I just have, it's just like been making me really sick [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2828.72s)]
*  and I feel like I just needed to say something [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2832.52s)]
*  that I think, you don't have to think that. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2835.72s)]
*  I'm not asking you to do anything, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2839.16s)]
*  but I just have to say that so I'm not sitting by, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2844.04s)]
*  you know, there's that peace inside of me, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2848.76s)]
*  like, why can't you say something? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2850.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, there's people that can't even speak [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2853.44s)]
*  and you can say something, you know, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAa1YsZoQ8&t=2855.6800000000003s)]
