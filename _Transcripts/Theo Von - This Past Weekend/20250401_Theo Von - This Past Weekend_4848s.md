*  Just had to change it and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=821.0s)]
*  Wear a jacket actually that somebody had thrown on stage in Montana to a comedy shot wore that [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=823.68s)]

*  Mean she has the voice of the evening that I heard a lot of great voices in there [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=837.68s)]
*  But my god [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=843.44s)]

*  Just it was awesome man. We got to sit there and listen to some music together and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=859.6400000000001s)]
*  and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=864.08s)]
*  you know, there was kind of a point in like there's one point we're sitting there and um, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  This is kind of I guess a childish thought or whatever but I was like [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, I wish I kind of wish my mom would [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=874.72s)]
*  Give me a little hug or hold my hand or something [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=880.0s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy to say I don't mean like hold my hand but just kind of squeeze man [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=882.6s)]
*  Just something, you know, like we don't see each other that much and I [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=885.92s)]
*  Don't know this. This sounds crazy to say this kind of I guess but I've said a lot of weird shit over the years. Um, I [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=889.8s)]
*  Just I was thinking man, it'd be nice if she gave me some [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=896.68s)]
*  Sentimental but physical sign like sign of affection. That's what I was thinking, right? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=900.1199999999999s)]
*  and so I'm sitting there next to her and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=906.52s)]
*  And then I just reached over and grabbed my mom's hand [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=910.88s)]
*  That's what I did [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=917.52s)]
*  And [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=920.56s)]
*  And [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  And then we were just kind of held hands for maybe 30 seconds or something [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=923.76s)]
*  You know, just put my hand on top of hers. Let her know that I care [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=927.76s)]
*  And it was just something like [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=934.36s)]
*  For me like a moment like that is interesting because a lot of my life I would just sit there and be like man I wish [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=938.4s)]
*  There was this moment of affection [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=945.64s)]
*  But I wish somebody else would do it right or I I'm upset that they're not doing it, you know and [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=947.8s)]
*  Then I just did it. I [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=955.08s)]
*  Just reached over and yeah, my mom's an older lady, you know and at some point I got to be [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  No, that's not it. I don't have to [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=966.1999999999999s)]
*  But I don't it was just like well if I want this I [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=969.0s)]
*  Can also get it for myself [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=973.16s)]
*  You know [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=975.16s)]
*  And it really had the same effect once I got over the fact of like oh [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=977.16s)]
*  I wish they would show the affection first or I wish they would do the action [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=981.0799999999999s)]
*  To be the person providing the affection, which is probably what I thought of a lot when I was a child [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=986.1999999999999s)]
*  But then this time I just reached and I just put my hand on my mom's hand, you know [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=993.64s)]
*  Because she's getting older. She's not the child now, but she's [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=998.92s)]
*  You know just where we're at in our lives things are kind of even [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1002.2s)]
*  And it still had the same outcome for me. It made me feel okay [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1006.5200000000001s)]
*  The second I got over that little moment of kind of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1010.84s)]
*  Jealousy or wishing or not jealousy, but like wishing somebody else had started the action [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1015.24s)]
*  The second I got over that I just had a nice moment where I got to sit there and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1022.5200000000001s)]
*  Just be with my mother and watch her go [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1028.1200000000001s)]
*  Just be with my mother and watch country music, which is something that we both enjoy doing and uh [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1030.76s)]
*  And something that's important to me in my life, you know to have moments with my mother where [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1036.9199999999998s)]
*  We're doing something that we like to do and we're doing it together, you know, um [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1042.12s)]
*  So, I don't know if that sounds weird or whatever I honestly I don't care if it sounds weird, you know [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1049.8s)]
*  I really don't part of me does still but uh [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1056.52s)]
*  but I think the part of me that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1060.1999999999998s)]
*  That needs those type of moments is like hey, man [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  Finally you're meeting you're trying to meet [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1067.6399999999999s)]
*  Just the universe how you're taking some direction to do something for how you feel, you know [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1070.52s)]
*  um [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1077.32s)]
*  Instead of just because I always in my life have been caught in this moment like god. I wish they would do this [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1079.1599999999999s)]
*  I wish this I wish this and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1084.12s)]
*  So, I don't know that was just kind of an interesting moment for me and then I put my arm around my mom's shoulder and just like um [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1086.52s)]
*  Yeah, like she was [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1095.0s)]
*  You know like she was [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1097.3999999999999s)]
*  You know my mom and we were just having a nice time [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1100.36s)]
*  and uh [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1103.3999999999999s)]
*  And once I did that I was getting the react. I was getting [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1105.4799999999998s)]
*  What I wanted out of the moment [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1110.04s)]
*  I was like, you know, and I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't made an effort [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1112.12s)]
*  I'm not trying to say hey look at me. I'm just trying to say like for so long [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  I've always been the person and I still am a lot of times but this time I wasn't [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1120.28s)]
*  where [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1124.68s)]
*  I'm like man. I wish somebody would do this [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1125.8s)]
*  So that I would be able to have a certain type of moment right now or so that to show me that they care [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1128.76s)]
*  And um [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1135.24s)]
*  And I didn't really realize that if I do it myself some I can still get some of that same uh, result [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1137.0s)]
*  so I don't know if that makes a lot of sense or not, but um [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1143.0s)]
*  And yeah, just I don't know yeah, sometimes you [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1148.84s)]
*  You know, you may only want you know, you may [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1154.6s)]
*  Sometimes you got to put your own pickles in the chili, you know, that's what i'm saying. I think [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1161.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that sounds crazy, but sometimes [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1167.08s)]
*  If you want pickles in the chili and that's the only way you're gonna have the chili [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1169.3999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes you gotta you gotta bring the pickles man [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1173.8s)]

*  Cousin [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1442.52s)]
*  Oh, yes, it is physically possible for first cousins to have children [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1445.24s)]
*  But it is important to understand that such relationships carry a slightly elevated risk of genetic disorders compared to [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1448.76s)]

*  I would take that out of the equation [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1721.72s)]
*  And I would just look at do you like welding you're saying you don't like it [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1724.52s)]

*  I hate this but what really do I hate about it? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1736.44s)]
*  Do you hate that you're you're in school for it right now? Do you hate that you're having to learn it? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1739.24s)]
*  Do you hate that you have to get up at certain hours to go learn it? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1743.4s)]
*  Because you may love welding you may just you may not be in it like being at class at 8 a.m [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1747.8s)]
*  You know, and i'm not saying those things i'm just asking you to [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1751.72s)]
*  Or suggesting that you think you know try to figure out well, what don't I like about it? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1755.32s)]
*  Because sometimes i'll just be like man, I hate that shit, but I never really look at well [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1760.76s)]
*  Why do I hate it? What don't and then I might realize I don't really hate that [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1764.1200000000001s)]

*  um [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1770.84s)]
*  But I do believe that if you get into a trade that you do not like that you won't enjoy it [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1772.1200000000001s)]
*  And I do believe that there's things out there that we can all do that we would enjoy doing [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1777.48s)]
*  I believe that there's so many things [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1782.76s)]
*  so [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1785.16s)]
*  Yeah, I would take a look at that man [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1787.16s)]
*  I would take a look and just decide if you do not like welding and military as your backup [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1788.8400000000001s)]
*  I think the military is a great idea [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1793.24s)]
*  You know, I mean, I you know, I don't think it's a bad idea, especially at your age [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1795.5600000000002s)]
*  I wished I'd have gone in the military. I spent a lot of time just [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1801.64s)]
*  Sitting around just trying to lick my own dick or whatever, you know, or you know [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1805.0s)]
*  buying binoculars and shit and just fucking [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1810.3600000000001s)]
*  Not doing shit or whatever being a fucking shitty neighbor or whatever pervert, but what you you know you [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1813.56s)]
*  If you're going to military now, yeah, you're out in four years and you probably have a lot of skills [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1820.6000000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1824.76s)]
*  You may it'll probably help you get up early stay in shape all these things that are going to really help shape the rest [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1825.0s)]
*  Of your life, right now some people may have went to the military say deal [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1829.96s)]
*  You know what the fuck you're talking about fucking honky you little fucking queer you little gun pussy or whatever. That's fine [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1833.48s)]
*  They can say those things [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1840.2s)]
*  And I don't I haven't been [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1841.96s)]
*  But for you you're saying that that's what you've thought of as your backup option, you know [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1843.88s)]
*  Now you might you know, I don't know how long the military will be there, you know [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1849.16s)]
*  Depending on what they keep having our military carry out and the different actions that they have them do [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1854.0400000000002s)]
*  but [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1859.08s)]
*  I think it's a honorable thing. I have a ton of respect for our military and uh, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1860.9199999999998s)]
*  And I don't think you would go wrong with that choice [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1867.32s)]
*  um [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1871.24s)]
*  So that's kind of where i'm at with it, you know [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1872.36s)]
*  uh, and if you went in there, you know, you'd probably make a lot of great friends and [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1875.0s)]
*  You'd learn things about yourself that you like and don't and then you'd be uh be done and you're right [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1879.08s)]
*  You'd only be 22 and a half years old [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1882.6799999999998s)]
*  23 years old you got you have so much time. There's just so much time [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1885.3200000000002s)]
*  Man I wasted a lot of time and one of the things I wish I'd done in the military [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1891.0s)]
*  Just because I think you don't also get those moments of camaraderie where you get to be around a bunch of other guys, you know [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1895.88s)]
*  Um, so those are just my thoughts recognize. I've never been in the military [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1902.1200000000001s)]
*  But I do think you have time to do that and do countless other things [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1909.0800000000002s)]
*  And if you don't like welding, you know, you don't like it [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1913.48s)]
*  Then maybe it is time for a backup trade to try or a backup option [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=1917.5600000000002s)]

*  We thought that she had a little more time [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2278.6s)]
*  but um, yeah, um [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2281.32s)]
*  Since then I've spent most of my time by doing nothing, you know, um [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2284.2799999999997s)]

*  Which is good. I guess for getting out of [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2293.0s)]
*  My apartment. Um, but I would just let the time pass, you know [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2296.52s)]
*  but um [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2301.64s)]
*  recently i've started uh [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2303.24s)]
*  Going back to school full time and uh working again and [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2306.2s)]
*  honestly, I feel like i'm just doing it because it's uh [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2310.68s)]
*  Expected of me, you know from like people around me my family [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2314.2s)]
*  and my peers, um [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2318.3599999999997s)]
*  So maybe some people just expect me to move forward [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2320.8399999999997s)]
*  Pretty fast, but you know, I I don't want to you know, um [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2324.68s)]
*  Well, thanks for the call man, uh [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2329.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm sorry to hear about that. I can't even imagine that [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2332.28s)]
*  um in the sense of losing a girlfriend or a partner spouse, um [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2337.08s)]
*  You know i've lost people that i've loved you know, uh [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2345.32s)]
*  And it yeah, it feels so impossible [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2351.64s)]
*  Because I think it's so many things at once it's like [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2355.08s)]
*  You know something is gone and then [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2359.2400000000002s)]
*  the the finality and the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2362.04s)]
*  the uh [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2364.84s)]
*  The viciousness of life [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2367.56s)]
*  Um [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2371.48s)]
*  Is so evident and at the same time the preciousness of life [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2372.76s)]
*  and [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2377.32s)]
*  And how beautiful life is that it could even exist all that happens at the same time [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2379.4s)]
*  And then it's not even about us really because they're the ones who [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2386.84s)]
*  Who has life has ended so there's probably sometimes feelings of guilt that I had of like [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2390.52s)]
*  Feeling bad [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2398.36s)]
*  That's i'd lost someone, you know or not being able to separate the feelings into okay [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2401.0s)]
*  i'm in pain or I miss them or [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2407.0s)]
*  um [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2410.6s)]
*  I'm just loathing in my own sadness. I'm getting into self-pity like all those types of things happened [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2411.64s)]
*  I remember for me at the same time [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2417.64s)]
*  and uh [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2421.4s)]
*  And for one it's just so much [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2424.2000000000003s)]
*  And for two it's hard to organize it and to even start to think and decide which feelings go where [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2426.52s)]
*  I'd rather just sleep. I'd rather just hope that this goes away. I'd rather dream. I used to do that a lot [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2434.76s)]
*  When my dad died, I would just try and dream a lot because I felt like if I was dreaming [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2441.08s)]
*  Maybe I had a chance to like see him or that my feelings could be different or I could be living a completely different experience [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2445.48s)]
*  So I think a lot of it is normal [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2455.88s)]
*  And I bet it's hard to get back into the flow of something when you've lost like a partner [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2459.08s)]
*  Because you probably think a lot of your life is having that partner there with you [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2465.16s)]
*  And I think even if you're doing something just even if you don't feel it just have the practice of it [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2469.16s)]
*  Until your feelings and your emotional wellness [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2475.7200000000003s)]
*  Catch up with your actions [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2479.96s)]
*  Because one day they will you know, and you'll be glad that you [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2482.84s)]
*  Had started doing these things [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2487.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really know what to say man [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2491.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really know what to say man, oh just appreciate you like just telling us what's going on [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2494.12s)]
*  Maybe some people could call in actually [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2504.2s)]
*  And share things that if you had some experience with a loss of a loved one and I would say a [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2507.56s)]
*  wife [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2514.6s)]
*  Let's because this is a man calling I believe and so if you lost a wife or a girlfriend [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2516.2s)]
*  You know, um and they passed away and if you have just some maybe some [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2522.44s)]
*  Experience with that if you could drop a call on the voicemail [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2527.88s)]
*  985-664-9503 [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2532.04s)]
*  We will come back to that on our next solo episode. I don't know when it'll be [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2533.96s)]
*  It'll be within the next month, but I will come back to that and see if we have some answers [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2538.12s)]
*  Maybe we can get some suggestions from other people [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2542.04s)]
*  But yeah, man, I hate to even leave you on this call [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2546.04s)]
*  Uh [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2551.56s)]
*  But um [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2553.72s)]
*  Yeah, life is just [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2556.52s)]
*  Sometimes it's just a lot of freaking pickles on your chili, isn't it? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2559.8s)]
*  Um [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2564.6s)]
*  Love you brother. Let's take another call. It's hard to say when somebody's going through something like that [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2566.76s)]
*  You know, but that's just also the oddness of the world it just keeps moving you can't stop it [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2574.2s)]
*  The world doesn't have any handlebars on it [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2578.44s)]
*  Time just doesn't have any [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2581.08s)]
*  It doesn't you can't get your hands into it [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2583.56s)]
*  That's the most painful part sometimes of everything [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2587.64s)]
*  um [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2591.2400000000002s)]

*  In this moment where I don't know what's coming for me in life. Like I feel like I failed myself [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2619.4s)]
*  Because I made stupid adult decisions at such a young age [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2626.6000000000004s)]
*  Um [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2631.32s)]

*  One last thing the guy's got to kind of think about right now. Um [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2677.72s)]
*  No, man [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2681.24s)]
*  look first of all [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2682.8399999999997s)]
*  The fact that you're calling even to talk about this [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  Shows I think a level of maturity that is a lot of people wouldn't do [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2687.7999999999997s)]
*  So right you're curious you're looking at what's going on. You're evaluating where you're at and you you're like [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2692.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, I want to get to a place where [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2697.72s)]
*  I feel either confident about this or I have some support in this [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2699.9599999999996s)]
*  So how do I get there? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2703.56s)]
*  Well, i'm going to reach out to other people and see what's going on see if I can get some thoughts some suggestions [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2704.4399999999996s)]
*  Even to somebody to listen to me [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2709.16s)]
*  um [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2711.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's young to be out there gunning like that, you know just to be rooting through some trap out there [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2712.7599999999998s)]
*  With no visor on daddy, you know [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2719.16s)]
*  With no hoodie on. Yeah, but that's that's the world we're in [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2722.12s)]
*  Um [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2726.3599999999997s)]
*  So I wouldn't be you are where you are you could also look at it as that god has gifted you guys with an opportunity [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2728.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2735.72s)]
*  I think people will probably be [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2737.0s)]
*  Disappointed maybe in where you're at because they don't want to see you miss out on opportunities for yourself that could uh [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2739.54s)]
*  That there might be less of if you have a child. That's probably what the disappointment is [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2746.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's disappointment in you having a child [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=2751.32s)]

*  My buddy knew this foreign exchange student he gave money to these guys to try and buy him a pack of cigarettes [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3295.4199999999996s)]
*  These guys are like 30 years old. They just told him to fuck off. We're keeping your money [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3302.3799999999997s)]
*  So I decided to go up and punch him as hard as I could in the head [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3309.02s)]
*  And I didn't realize the police are there [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3313.18s)]
*  So i'm getting chased by this guy's buddy with like a foot long knife. I keep looking back [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3315.58s)]
*  Still getting chased by the guy with the knife then I look back. It's the cops chasing me [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3321.74s)]
*  So i'm at one end of a semi and the cop is at the other end of a semi truck [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3327.9s)]
*  Yeah, we're playing peekaboo to see where I go. I'm wearing a bright red chicago bulls jacket [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3333.9s)]

*  I'm at the same train station that I punched the guy at i'm hammered standing on the platform [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3355.58s)]
*  And then I get sucker punched in the back of the head and oh, who is it? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3362.7000000000003s)]
*  The guy stole that guy that kid's 20 bucks [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3367.02s)]
*  And then the he just ended up pushing me like that and I fell onto the train tracks [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3370.46s)]
*  And the train was coming in [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3376.22s)]
*  So there's I didn't know what to do [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3378.54s)]
*  I just throw my body above the yellow line and it caught my legs and dragged me like 15 feet [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3380.62s)]
*  They like ripped my shoes off ripped my pants in half. Oh god. It's a pervert basically [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3388.06s)]

*  Like a bit much, huh dude, that's insane man [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3400.38s)]
*  So and were you drunk or were you already impaired when the train hit you or what kind of condition were you in? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3403.2599999999998s)]
*  Physically just at that point in your life [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3409.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I was an everyday alcoholic. We would all the boys would meet [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3412.22s)]
*  Well, what I got this question though, which sorry to interrupt you there [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3417.66s)]
*  But what kind of train driver would hit a drug just hit a guy? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3420.94s)]
*  Would hit a drunk guy [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3425.58s)]
*  Did you ever speak with the driver [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3428.2999999999997s)]
*  No, well the thing is is [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3430.94s)]
*  The sea train's moving so fast, right? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3433.58s)]
*  So it's coming to dock into the station to let everybody off [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3436.54s)]
*  There's nothing he really could have done to I don't know you can see a white dude most of the time [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3441.02s)]
*  You know no matter what's going on [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3446.46s)]
*  but damn brother, I can't believe that and so [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3448.86s)]
*  So you were stabbed 10 times you've been hit by a train [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3451.74s)]
*  But god had more in store for you. Didn't he what else happened? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3455.58s)]
*  Um [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3459.34s)]
*  The biggest one was the balcony because I ended up buying some cocaine that wasn't [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3460.38s)]
*  Wasn't all cocaine. Oh, so there was meth in it. Oh, yeah, right [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3465.5s)]
*  The moguls got some bounce to them, huh? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3471.18s)]
*  Shit man every time I looked through the little hole in my door [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3474.46s)]
*  There'd be four people outside with weapons trying to bust in that's what I would see [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3477.9s)]
*  I'm dragging the like a diorama kind of [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3483.42s)]
*  Yeah, i'm dragging the couch with the landlord on it to the front door to try and block it damn brother [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3486.78s)]
*  He told me to go to bed. So I went to bed and woke up [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3493.6600000000003s)]
*  All I could do was get a glass of water. I looked through that people in the door [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3498.78s)]
*  And the same thing people looks like people with guns are trying to bust in the apartment [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3503.1000000000004s)]
*  So I tried to go from my balcony over to the neighbors and i'm on the seventh floor so [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3509.3399999999997s)]
*  Can we let's let's who are they there? There was nobody even in there. That's why I was trying to get over to the thing [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3516.7s)]
*  And how far is that? Is that a jump you're trying to make or did you have a kind of a rope set up or anything like that? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3524.22s)]
*  um [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3530.14s)]
*  Did you have a little trebuchet anything? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3531.1s)]
*  Shit like you could if you reached across you could pass a beer to your neighbor. So it wasn't that far [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3534.06s)]
*  Okay, I just kind of was trying to leapfrog over. I know it's kind of stupid but when you're fucked up like that [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3539.98s)]
*  Well, it's a great idea. I mean [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3547.66s)]
*  Yeah, here's the thing people don't realize that people that are wasted have done amazing things, you know one of the guys [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3550.06s)]
*  Um, have you heard of louis and clark? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3555.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I think so one of them was an addict and they [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3557.9s)]
*  Discovered like a third of the north america. So let's don't [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3562.54s)]
*  You can't always beat down on addicts, but so take me out there. You're on the balcony. You're high on cocaine and what is [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3567.1000000000004s)]
*  Your plan is to make that leap over to the other balcony [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3573.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3577.26s)]
*  and then [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3578.46s)]

*  At first I stood up right on the thing and held my hand on the wall, but I was [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3604.06s)]
*  Yeah [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3611.2599999999998s)]
*  On the balcony [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3612.62s)]

*  I'm gonna fall so I like crouched down to try and like leap like that [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3618.78s)]
*  Oh, you get some uh build up a little bit of energy or whatever. What is it called potential energy you crouch down? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3623.9s)]

*  Oh, I didn't even hit the other balcony. I'm sorry, dude [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3641.1800000000003s)]

*  You're a miracle, you know a lot of people do not get to live through stabbings through train hitings through [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=3661.1s)]

*  Well, thanks for calling willy. Um, the only things I know about this are I don't think you can uh, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4165.099999999999s)]
*  quit cocaine [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4171.42s)]
*  without quitting alcohol that's [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4172.7s)]
*  For me, that's what i've seen. I'm not saying that's everybody's case. I'm not that's for me for me [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4176.38s)]
*  That's what i've seen and then let me think about what else. Um [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4181.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think you have to get into recovery now if you're pretty bad off first you need to go to a detox [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4186.38s)]
*  And then once you're clean, then you need to get into a recovery program [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4191.42s)]
*  You know maybe a 30 day or an impatient or then start to go to cocaine anonymous or alcoholics anonymous meetings with a friend [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4195.02s)]
*  If you don't like cocaine anonymous meetings, I suggest alcoholics anonymous because there's more meetings and it's the same thing [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4202.78s)]
*  Cocaine and alcohol aren't the same thing but addiction is the same [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4209.58s)]
*  So if you can you can apply the same principles and you can talk to a sponsor about doing that [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4213.1s)]
*  Um, I wish I had some other cure for you. That's the only thing that I know that's ever helped me [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pmsLXy3cE&t=4218.78s)]
