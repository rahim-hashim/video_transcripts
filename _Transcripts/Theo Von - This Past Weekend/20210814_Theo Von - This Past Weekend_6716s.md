*  We were like seventh graders. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  That's the dark arts, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=389.08000000000004s)]

*  Giant tits lady. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=395.16s)]

*  when they were talking to me. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=400.52s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons why I did it, why I had trouble learning it sometimes [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=401.52s)]
*  in certain classes, because it's like once they open, I couldn't hear anything. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=404.76s)]
*  Yeah, you were in the library smashing your dick into books. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=409.0s)]

*  I was at the library for so many hours. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=421.0s)]

*  Hopefully he can, I don't know. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=654.12s)]
*  He might have autism. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=655.12s)]

*  He's part of a religious group and they don't do it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=669.72s)]
*  What type of religion? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=675.12s)]
*  Christian. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=676.12s)]

*  I'm still firing him off. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=679.12s)]
*  He's with you, but you're more of a Hester Perlentine. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=682.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=684.12s)]
*  I was a Catholic and they would talk to you about coming. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=685.12s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=688.12s)]
*  I had some priests ask me about it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=689.12s)]
*  You grew up Catholic, right, do you? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=691.12s)]
*  Uh, we were Baptists, like sixth Baptists, I think. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=693.12s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=697.12s)]
*  You ever get any guys talking to you about cum? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=698.12s)]
*  We had a professor, I guess, or I think then it was a teacher, you know? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=701.12s)]
*  I remember he drew a picture of a wiener ejaculating on the chalkboard. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=708.12s)]
*  He kind of described, he told us what the feelings would be like. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=716.12s)]
*  We wouldn't be able to handle it and stuff. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=720.88s)]
*  Then he drew it like, he drew the ejaculate just coming out. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=723.12s)]
*  It was really insane. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=730.12s)]
*  Was he like making the noise with it? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=731.12s)]
*  I remember he, I do remember he was one of those double chalkboards. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=735.12s)]
*  Here comes a big one. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=738.12s)]
*  I remember he would put the marker on the board and then walk it across the board. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=739.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=747.12s)]
*  It was pretty crazy, man. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=748.12s)]
*  And he wore the shortest shorts too. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=749.12s)]
*  He died, man. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=751.12s)]
*  Willie, I think Derek Usner was his name or something. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=752.12s)]
*  And I think his son might have died, but he died. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=756.12s)]
*  His son died too? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=758.12s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=760.12s)]
*  I don't want to say that, but I'm pretty sure. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=761.12s)]
*  And he had the biggest mustache. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=763.12s)]
*  His words, I felt like his words were... [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=765.12s)]
*  Big mustache and he was talking... [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=767.12s)]
*  Oh, bro. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=769.12s)]
*  His mustache came over both lips. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=770.12s)]
*  So it was like... [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=772.12s)]
*  He's dead. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=773.12s)]
*  The words couldn't even, some of the words, you just had to guess what they were. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=775.12s)]
*  Some people thought he was black. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=778.12s)]
*  People didn't know what was going on. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=781.12s)]
*  It was dicey. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=782.12s)]
*  People thought he was black. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=783.12s)]
*  We just couldn't understand what he was talking about. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=784.12s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=787.12s)]
*  It was just different times back then. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=788.12s)]
*  It was different times. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=790.12s)]
*  But yeah, I've never really had an experience with an older woman. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=792.12s)]
*  You have not. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=796.12s)]
*  I haven't had that experience. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=797.12s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=798.12s)]
*  Is it? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=799.12s)]
*  You just let them go. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=800.12s)]
*  Dude, I remember one time this one girl was so hot, I felt like I was afraid to even go in the same room with her. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=801.12s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=807.12s)]
*  So girls, yeah, I think with regular, legally-aged women, it can get a little bit dicey. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=808.12s)]
*  But yeah, I guess if you have an older lady, you're kind of the little... [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=815.12s)]
*  Now you're the... [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=819.12s)]
*  You're the meal. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=820.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=821.12s)]
*  It feels nice to be a snack sometimes. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=822.12s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=823.12s)]
*  So you don't beat off. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=824.12s)]

*  You got to do something that's out of the box and that's gonna be [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3483.7400000000002s)]
*  And then once you're and then you I think you got a rap I think if you're gonna go from having no [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3488.3s)]

*  Well, I would do what I would do now is do something do something in the other direction [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3506.26s)]
*  You got to do a different type of symbol, you know, I think you need to do like a Mason [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3509.9s)]
*  If they have a symbol [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3513.7000000000003s)]
*  You could do a star David and send it to the people that got the Nazi pizza and make it up to him [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3515.7400000000002s)]
*  you could do a [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3521.34s)]
*  I [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3523.46s)]
*  Don't know what you could do it's kind of [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3525.46s)]
*  It's kind of the only symbol that's like a yeah like armor when we were kids on a school bus [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3529.54s)]
*  We drew swastikas on some kid named Scottie's t-shirt. It's funny and he [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3533.9s)]
*  Went in after care. We didn't know what the symbol meant or anything [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3538.86s)]
*  we're just course we'd seen it on like pamphlets or whatever around town and and [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3541.3s)]
*  Then we drew it on his shirt [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3545.58s)]
*  And then he had to wash the shirt, right? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3547.58s)]
*  And so but he had to keep wearing it and so like it always had it on there a little bit [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3549.7s)]
*  It was crazy man. I drew a swastika my friend's forehead once he fell asleep. No, and he cried Wow [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3553.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's that Charles Manson. He has one. Yeah [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3560.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I think you got to do something you got to rap or do something [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3564.46s)]
*  I think you got to really or come out of the closet via pizza. You got to do something that's gonna get you [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3567.1s)]
*  That's gonna get your name out there. So that's wild. So you went from and then suddenly people know your name [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3573.9s)]
*  For sure. Is it weird when you see SNL people around New York City? Yeah friends with like Michael Che, right? Yeah [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3579.9s)]
*  Did you ask any of them to put in a word for you? Do you know? No, I didn't ask no, right [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3588.66s)]
*  What are they gonna do? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3594.58s)]
*  Yeah, and that's like a fucked up thing to ask to be like hey risk. Will you risk something for me? Like I was just [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3596.5s)]
*  While it happened. I was like, oh I'm fired for sure and then it just got drawn out like I knew I was fucked [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3603.18s)]
*  Yeah, because I think if they were mad about that there's there's other stuff. There's a lot right? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3608.82s)]
*  This is you know [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3614.1000000000004s)]
*  Do you think? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=3616.82s)]

*  Better than the ability of a lot of people I know or myself or anyone sure it's just like I don't know [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4101.68s)]

*  Crazy would find him just in his car somewhere [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4178.0s)]

*  Yeah, you're like that. I think you were like yeah, cuz of the Holocaust. Yeah, they were all [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4373.32s)]
*  in the same space [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4379.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I thought I didn't it was very funny and then you were like Hitler how far did it live from? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4381.72s)]
*  Really it's so funny [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4392.16s)]
*  I think it would be commuted to the Holocaust I [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4394.68s)]
*  went to work [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4400.639999999999s)]
*  Like you checked into an office. It was like all right things are this is good. This is what I planned [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4404.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I think yeah, I always [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4409.36s)]
*  Cuz I grew up in an area of a lot of incest and so when you're around incest you learn about other incest [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4412.32s)]
*  You know you kind of you know water seeks its own or whatever, but [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4416.92s)]
*  so [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4422.16s)]
*  Ari manas who's my opener who's Jewish is always what we were chatting about [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4423.4s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4427.5599999999995s)]
*  He told me that a lot of incest in the Jewish communities because are always thought a lot of incest in the G [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4427.92s)]
*  He said there's a lot of incest in Jewish community. Yeah, he said so I always thought that [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4432.96s)]
*  It was because yeah like the Holocaust people are stuck together you have sex with whoever is local to yes [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4437.599999999999s)]
*  You know which is the same reason that they had incest in our community growing up [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4443.36s)]
*  Yeah, or a lot of rural community like Ireland [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4447.28s)]
*  Yeah, people don't want to go that far to have sex [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4450.44s)]
*  Bottom line it's sad to say but if somebody you know, but I think the Holocaust was maybe in the ghettos before [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4453.36s)]
*  But the Holocaust I think they separated men and women right and that's all and that shocked me [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4462.0s)]
*  but because I've read uh [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4467.599999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. No, it's just saying the Holocaust is a place is very funny [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4471.5599999999995s)]
*  I'd be like does he did he go to AIDS? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4479.2s)]
*  The Holocaust is a thing. Yeah, it's not a place because what was that book? I read [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4483.799999999999s)]
*  It was freaking good though, but but it was about the Holocaust but you stick your dick in it, huh? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4491.08s)]
*  You just read night by Eli Weisel [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4497.04s)]
*  Man I got a I are we allowed to tell these jokes on it. We're having I think we're okay. I'm saying it [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4502.759999999999s)]
*  You're not yeah, and I don't think we're nobody's saying anything bad. We're with Jewish people [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4507.44s)]
*  We didn't say anything bad and I I just that that's something that I thought I didn't know [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4512.24s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with not knowing something true [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4516.84s)]
*  But yeah, and then I didn't know like I didn't know I never seen like the charts or anything [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4520.68s)]
*  Like where did Adolf Hitler live at like that? I thought maybe lived [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4525.24s)]
*  Like out front or something I guess I guess I equate it to like slavery or something, you know [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4530.599999999999s)]
*  And not that it's the same thing, but I just equate it to like a bad thing. And then I think in my head [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4535.36s)]
*  I'm thinking oh, well the slave owner probably lived on the edge of the I see yes in that case [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4540.12s)]
*  The comparison would be like an SS guard. Yeah while the president [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4546.14s)]
*  You know what I mean an SS guard would be like a plantation owner, right but the president he wasn't like [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4552.28s)]
*  coming down to plantations and be like [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4558.24s)]
*  My plans working right right. You know what I mean? Yeah, I bet Hitler definitely went [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4561.08s)]
*  That's actually now you mentioned it. Yes, I bet he did go inspect like nice [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4566.58s)]
*  Can't believe it's worked. That's crazy this idea, you know [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4572.34s)]
*  It's crazy masterminds. This is crazy when you put your mind to something [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4576.38s)]
*  Here brick and mortar [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4582.7s)]
*  Was like holy shit, man [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4588.7s)]
*  You think it was with his boys like everyone's when I go just take a step back and be like we did it [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4591.1s)]
*  you know [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4595.5s)]
*  That's it sounds like a Louis CK bit almost definitely [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4599.18s)]
*  Hitler Hitler killing killing himself reminds me of a [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4602.7s)]
*  Hitler just when he killed himself, he killed himself in a bunker [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4606.38s)]
*  Did he with all his boys Wow and the Soviets were like in Berlin? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4609.34s)]
*  They were like, oh, they're about to get it was he was about to get caught and he was like [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4613.860000000001s)]
*  You're not gonna get me [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4618.18s)]
*  And he killed himself [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4620.860000000001s)]
*  That's pretty funny [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4622.860000000001s)]
*  Well, I was still it's just Andy just he just said I'm done. Yeah at the end [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4625.179999999999s)]
*  He was like, well, you're not even gonna get me you guys can't get me. Oh, it's such a pussy move [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4629.58s)]
*  Yeah, but in his defense. Yeah, he was definitely gonna get fucking he was gonna get in trouble [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4634.74s)]
*  Yeah at that point everyone was like [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4639.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4642.0199999999995s)]
*  What the fuck did you do it the whole world isn't it crazy how nobody knew kind of what was going on [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4644.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the craziest thing to me. Yeah [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4649.46s)]
*  Yeah, you can't keep anything a secret now, no, you know, you can't even keep a couple you can't even keep [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4652.320000000001s)]
*  You know actually some people can keep a secret they had like that Elizabeth smart girl was locked up for like six [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4659.64s)]
*  We what's that about months kidnapped people now. There's people for eight years in Cleveland in the basement. That's crazy [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4665.88s)]
*  But I guess you just don't know what your neighbors are doing [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4673.280000000001s)]
*  Just being locked in a basement, but it's crazy years [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4676.240000000001s)]
*  That's a guy that locks you up. What did this guy ask us? Oh [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4680.4400000000005s)]
*  He wanted to know when the special my special is coming up. Mark. Norman's had a great success with his special on YouTube [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4684.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah, I think that's that's a pretty reasonable option. Yeah, it's a yeah, and if it doesn't work it's on you [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4689.78s)]
*  You know if I put it out and no one likes it will you put it out in a full segment or clips? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4698.04s)]
*  Do you have any I'll definitely put clips out? Yeah, that's the thing [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4702.88s)]
*  You gotta put the whole thing out and then you put clips and all that [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4705.24s)]
*  Which you know it sucks to have to play the internet thing that game. I'd much rather have [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4708.0s)]
*  Like an HBO or a Netflix make it and that's it. I don't have to do the whole [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4714.0s)]
*  Cuz like right like Schultz like Schultz talks about it [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4719.28s)]
*  I talked to Schultz Andrew Schultz a lot about it cuz he does it [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4722.04s)]
*  You got it [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4724.88s)]
*  If you're doing it on your own like this is what he would say if you're doing it on your own you have to be [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4725.679999999999s)]
*  Your own marketer right which is hard. It's hard. You know what I mean? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4730.0s)]
*  It's hard to be that is it. I don't like it. I'm uncomfortable trying to market myself [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4733.98s)]
*  Oh, I guess that's interesting, but I think if you just put the put it out there a lot of people will find it for sure [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4738.58s)]
*  Putting it out yourself. I'm talking about marketing it to be like hey, here's a [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4745.04s)]
*  Crazy captions on the bottom of my you gotta do thumbnails [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4750.0199999999995s)]
*  And you got to have titles that are like white guy slams Indian right you know what I mean [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4753.58s)]
*  Yeah, some of that I and that stuff sucks. I don't like to do I don't like I hate doing it and most [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4758.58s)]
*  You'd be surprised how many people hate doing it themselves, but it's [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4763.98s)]
*  the right thing to do [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4767.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting some of it's like some of it [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4769.9s)]
*  But some of times the material can just stand on its own [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4772.299999999999s)]
*  And you don't need like the big but you sometimes you do have to course you have to get some of it [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4774.299999999999s)]
*  You have to get the wording or something to get people to see it [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4777.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's all those tricks that otherwise if you were handled by a network. They would just handle it [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4780.419999999999s)]
*  They would just do it themselves, but if you're doing it yourself unfortunately you do have to play that type of game [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4785.9s)]
*  It yeah, that's a good point I heard that [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4790.9s)]
*  Mark Normans was like the seventh most watched special yeah [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4795.22s)]
*  If you liked over like you over HBO Showtime those sorts of the one [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4801.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Netflix doesn't release theirs right there, right? I don't release their metrics [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4806.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but Norman put on YouTube special and it's number seven. That's pretty crazy. It's pretty crazy. That's really crazy [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4809.68s)]
*  So that's a lot of eyes man. Yeah, hopefully we'll see hopefully hiding [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4815.86s)]
*  Hopefully it does well if it doesn't you know just fucking kill myself [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4819.5s)]

*  It's like there's not worse. It's so like that's one thing [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4897.9s)]
*  I didn't like about the Charleston thing whenever those guys came out with those [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4900.3s)]
*  Tiki torches, you know, and they're like these guys are all Nazis. It's like [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4903.1s)]

*  Yeah [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4946.26s)]
*  It's like that's actual like if you compare to some of the pictures of like how many Nazis they had [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4946.62s)]
*  200,000 years 200 years ago 150 years ago. Yeah, they packed Madison Square Garden [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4951.44s)]

*  Hey [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4981.74s)]
*  But I wonder if they're also just including fret fraternity kids that do that sign and that they're being and that they're be like [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4985.82s)]
*  Oh, these guys are white supremacists. I wonder I think that's probably like estimated like 3,000 like dudes [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4990.94s)]
*  They're like no I put on the hat [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=4996.08s)]

*  Wonder how many because the crazy thing about that the crazy thing about the white power sign is they took the okay sign [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5004.9s)]
*  Yeah, basically and made that said oh that means white power [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5010.62s)]

*  Did it to make everybody follow through with it? I think I could be wrong you look that up [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5018.74s)]
*  I think there was like a 4chan thing or one of those guys type things [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5024.5s)]
*  And they were like it'll it'll just make people look silly when they're like actually that's a secret white supremacist sign right [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5028.62s)]
*  When it's like no, it's it's a okay or it's this game where you punch your friend in the arm, right? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5035.34s)]

*  But then the crazy part is you look back through time so many pictures of people are like okay in the past everything's okay [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5046.22s)]

*  Yeah, I can't sit down and be a writer and then have somebody else go tell the jokes yeah, that'd be tough to watch [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5094.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you ever write on anything like that? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5100.719999999999s)]

*  Oh, yeah, some people will do that and they have they're totally happy doing it. Yeah [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5107.599999999999s)]

*  It's probably a healthy thing to be like no. I don't care who who gets the adoration [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5128.12s)]
*  I'm like I should they should laugh at me [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5132.8s)]
*  Yeah, if I wrote a joke and somebody else told it I'd be like fucking piece of shit. Oh [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5135.16s)]
*  stole it [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5139.72s)]

*  Yeah, I think well even this was a good pizza guy [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5145.12s)]
*  It's like I was trying to tell the guy you have to do something you have to put something on a pizza [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5147.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's already been done. Yes [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5151.04s)]
*  So you got it. Yeah, just got to think of something kind of creative. I think [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5154.08s)]
*  Yeah, when do you think that you were part of like you know that eight the Asian hate thing started [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5160.68s)]
*  Do you feel like it? Yeah, I was pretty bad luck. Do you feel like you started that at all? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5166.84s)]
*  No, but I was actually yeah now you mentioned it. Yes. I was one of the first I [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5171.24s)]
*  Was definitely early in the Asian hate community because the after that it kind of that's when it kind of took off [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5176.400000000001s)]
*  I feel like that's when [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5182.52s)]
*  Yeah [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5184.4400000000005s)]
*  But you it wasn't obviously [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5185.64s)]
*  And that's ridiculous [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5190.400000000001s)]
*  No, that's fine. It was kind of yeah, I mean it was media attention about a slur right directed at Asian people [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5192.400000000001s)]
*  so yes that definitely and and [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5199.12s)]
*  People are perfectly reasonable to see a headline that says this guy said this slur and they're perfectly reasonable to be like fuck that guy [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5202.280000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, cuz no and I do the same thing. I don't read articles. I'll see a fucking headline [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5210.68s)]
*  I'll be like, oh shit. They're guilty. Yeah, fuck them or there's no context or who knows [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5215.72s)]
*  How the fuck does the Washington Post report on a podcast from 2018? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5221.72s)]
*  Right see the accuracy they're using here or are they just like this guy's getting fired for being racist [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5225.68s)]
*  Clicks what can we call it? Yeah clicks? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5230.92s)]
*  Yeah, they don't get no one cares. It's all done. The caring is done. The problem is though is when they write those articles [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5234.200000000001s)]
*  After what I've said that doesn't count [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5241.360000000001s)]
*  When they write an article that says a slur like this guy used this slur [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5243.360000000001s)]
*  Then normal people who obviously would have never heard Matt and Shane secret podcast are like holy shit [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5247.76s)]
*  He said like they're just in the New York Times. It's like here's the word that that guy said that's bad, right? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5254.120000000001s)]
*  That would have never reached these people ever [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5260.0s)]
*  You know, what percentage of your viewership go up after the article? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5262.6s)]
*  It probably doubled [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5266.84s)]
*  Yeah, since the the months after after SNL our [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5269.48s)]
*  listenership probably [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5274.4s)]
*  Quadrupled. Yeah for sure because then people heard about it and watched it. So it's helped the part. This is actually funny [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5275.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's helped the podcast tremendously [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5281.08s)]
*  Wow, yeah [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5283.4s)]

*  Yeah, brother. No, it's like people that are like all this it sounds, you know, I was trying to figure out who the pizza guys were [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5290.52s)]
*  Yeah, it turns out if they were putting out some more funny content [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=5297.6s)]

*  No one laughed at that either [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6118.66s)]
*  Yeah, you got to fight for comedy man. We have to fight to be able to joke around. Isn't that crazy? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6121.46s)]
*  Yeah [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6126.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, especially when most people know you're joking that there's this it's a government [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6128.1s)]
*  Yeah for sure [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6133.9s)]
*  Everyone knows you're joking even the people writing the articles. They know it's a fucking joke. They have a bigger agenda [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6135.259999999999s)]
*  They're trying to push. Yeah, and they're pretending what you're saying is serious [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6140.78s)]
*  Yeah, and that's just what it is and that's fine, right? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6144.099999999999s)]
*  In fact, it kind of wouldn't be as funny if people weren't getting upset, right? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6146.9s)]
*  You know if we were all like nice pizza nice swastika on that pizza, dude [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6151.94s)]
*  Right it'd be like like if people thought that you and I actually hated Jewish people or were fans of Nazi [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6156.0599999999995s)]
*  Because we yes joked about or if literally there would be zero blowback for going on a podcast and being like [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6162.9400000000005s)]
*  Here's some funny things about Hitler. Yeah, it's not as dangerous. It's not as funny. You know what I mean, right? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6170.900000000001s)]
*  That's the point I'm trying to make right this pizza swastika [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6176.04s)]
*  if those guys made that and sent that and everybody at Little Caesars and the people who received it were like [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6178.860000000001s)]
*  That was funny nice, right? It wouldn't be as far [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6184.780000000001s)]
*  The backlash on that one is that makes it funny [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6188.42s)]
*  I didn't know there were Nazis at Little Caesar. Yeah, that's making it funnier, you know, that's interesting [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6194.74s)]
*  I can't believe there's so many undercover Nazis at the comedy [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6201.02s)]
*  That's the crazy thing is that some people think there really are so I don't think there's one person that voted for a Republican [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6208.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's how far away from fascism. That is. Yeah [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6214.54s)]
*  Yeah [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6218.26s)]
*  Yes, wild man. It's a different time, dude [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6219.42s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't love talking about cancel culture. Yeah, I'm sorry. No, no, no, don't be sorry [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6222.780000000001s)]
*  I'm kind of I mean I did it I did it to myself. I'm sorry [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6228.820000000001s)]
*  Kind of a culture guy now, so I don't know if you are it's also just a fascinating topic right now [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6233.1s)]
*  I know it's just it gets [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6238.3s)]
*  Like when do you feel like it'll start to just suddenly did that's who you'll always be then. I don't think so [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6241.06s)]
*  I don't think so either. I'm confident. I'm not. Yeah, I'm confident. I'm good enough at stand-up that I'm not gonna be [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6245.5s)]
*  Then if you know that about yourself, then you're gonna be fine. Yeah, I am fine. I'm not I'm not worried about that [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6250.62s)]
*  I never really was I never was like this is gonna it'll always be part of my story [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6257.78s)]
*  That's how I was introduced into the comedy world. Yeah, but [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6262.94s)]
*  Was there any Asian comedians that were supportive? Yeah for sure. That's cool for sure definitely behind [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6268.42s)]
*  Right closed doors. In fact, everybody was supportive behind the scenes, right? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6275.46s)]
*  And that's to my face too [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6280.54s)]
*  So I'm sure there was a lot of them that weren't very supportive that weren't just gonna walk up to me [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6282.06s)]
*  Like I've had problems with people and I'm not gonna walk up to him be like, you know, you're a piece of shit [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxi4NOy5oHE&t=6285.86s)]
