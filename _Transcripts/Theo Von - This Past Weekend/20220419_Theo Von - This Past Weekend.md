*  If you did it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=17.5s)]
*  If you did Easter, man, then you probably know what I'm talking about. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=19.44s)]
*  If you enjoy Easter. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=22.44s)]
*  Don't let the Lord lick you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Where the good Lord. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=32.64s)]
*  What did they used to say? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=33.64s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=37.0s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=38.0s)]
*  I don't know what they said, but here we are. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=39.760000000000005s)]

*  Happy belated Easter. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=46.24s)]
*  And let's get into this episode. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=49.72s)]
*  Oh, that's a little slow, boy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=56.72s)]
*  That'll make you damn kill yourself at a wedding right there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=79.28s)]
*  That thing sounds a little. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=81.08s)]
*  That's a little slow. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=83.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=84.44s)]
*  I was trying to find some Easter Easter Easter music. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=85.44s)]
*  And Easter don't have a lot of good music. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=89.68s)]
*  That's another thing, you know, Easter don't have a lot of good music. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=91.36s)]
*  Most of it's at church. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  You got to go to church to hear it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Let's try one more. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=99.36s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=100.36s)]
*  Oh, that drum comes in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=132.36s)]
*  That drum comes in and doesn't even help. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little that's bad when the drum comes in and doesn't even help. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, that sound like a little maybe like an elementary school band that on the Titanic [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=153.96s)]
*  or something. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, the second they start up, this band is going down, boy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=161.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you could hear the water. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you could you could see the water rising outside of the classroom windows right [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=190.28s)]
*  That thing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=191.28s)]
*  That's a real sinkers anthem right there, I think. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=192.96s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=197.56s)]
*  I'm trying to find it there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=198.56s)]
*  One more good track for Easter music here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=199.56s)]
*  Let me see what I can do for us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=201.96s)]
*  Try to find one more. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=204.68s)]
*  There we go, baby. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  That's got a little more lift in it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=214.4s)]
*  Whenever you're down, out in the cold, faithless and die, your story's untold. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Come take my hand and walk there with me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=230.48s)]
*  I know a place where we can be free. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=236.0s)]
*  Let's go, baby. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=240.8s)]
*  There is a light shining for you, guiding your way, helping you through. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=241.8s)]
*  Shadows and gloom are all that you see. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=250.8s)]
*  We'll find a place where we can be free. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=253.8s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=262.8s)]
*  Can't you see? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=263.8s)]
*  You will be free. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  And that's a beautiful little tune right there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  I just found that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  And that is There is a Light by the Stonekeepers. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  And that band, they play some stuff. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  It seemed like something you could wash a baby to, really. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=300.6s)]
*  That's what you want. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's hear them again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  It's just instrumental here with this hitter. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=307.28000000000003s)]

*  You don't need a bra, ladies. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=331.8s)]
*  Let the Lord hold your tits, ladies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=332.92s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=335.0s)]
*  Man, big fellas. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=336.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=337.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=338.88s)]
*  That's something you could wash a dang baby to right there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=339.88s)]
*  You can just see the water going over his little back. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=357.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's something you could wash a baby to right there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=362.88s)]
*  Even wash under his thick little arms right there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=368.96s)]
*  Just get it up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=371.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=373.4s)]
*  You just want to just clean that little sucker out, get the devil out from under his arms. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=374.4s)]
*  When I was young, they used to tell you that if you stank real bad, they'd say you got [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  the devil under your arms, boy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=382.72s)]
*  And as a kid, you'd smell under your arm. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  You'd be like, dang, something is going on under there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=387.96s)]
*  I do have something non-well festering under me. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=391.92s)]
*  You know? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=396.92s)]
*  I do have something. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=398.64s)]
*  You know, I got a little dark arts garden under each pit, under each flapper, under [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=399.64s)]
*  each lifter, under each arm. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=405.6s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=409.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=410.48s)]
*  I hope you had a beautiful Easter time. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=411.48s)]
*  I had a nice time myself. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=412.48s)]
*  I hope you are, you know, wherever this episode finds you today, if you're in your car, if [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=413.88s)]
*  you're sitting at home, maybe having your little soup or something, you know, maybe [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  on a lunch break and you got a sandwich. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=425.88s)]
*  And some people look, some people cut their sandwiches. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=432.20000000000005s)]
*  And that's me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=436.76s)]
*  I cut my sandwich up. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=437.76s)]
*  You know, I do the four cut. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=440.0s)]
*  Some people do their sandwich. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=442.76s)]
*  They don't do any cut. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  They just bite into it just blindly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  It's no, there's not a real game plan. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=448.76s)]
*  It's very, those people, that's a real question mark fella right there, or strong woman. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=452.0s)]
*  Somebody who don't, the sandwich, it's more of that attack dog style, you know? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=461.44s)]
*  I'm just going to get in that bitch, get in there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=466.84s)]
*  But I like that one that's been more dissected. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=472.7s)]
*  You know, you always knew how much somebody's mom loved them when they were a kid if that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=477.48s)]
*  sandwich had been really clipped up. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=480.76s)]
*  You know, sometimes, you know, yeah, because your mom, your mom, if your mom really loves [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=485.64s)]
*  you, she cut that thing, you know, nice and. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=489.44s)]
*  And then you had them, you know, them regular boys out there and they eat that bitch's, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=493.72s)]
*  you know, that thing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=499.92s)]
*  Look, there's no plan to get into that thing. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=501.6s)]
*  That sandwich looks like you don't even want you to get into it sometimes if you look at [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=505.16s)]
*  it that way. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=508.08s)]
*  And that's certainly, when I was, yeah, when I was young, I had that kind of thing was. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  That thing was, didn't have a lot of entry points on it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=516.16s)]
*  A lot of those sandwiches we had. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=520.72s)]
*  What's going on, man? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=526.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's always that person at lunch that pulls that bad bastard out. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=528.28s)]
*  You're like, damn, boy, this dude. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=533.2s)]
*  This dude's going through some stuff. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=537.64s)]
*  That sandwich doesn't have anything going on with it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=539.72s)]
*  And sometimes some people, mom would cut the heart in the middle, be like, damn, they must [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=542.68s)]
*  be rich, bro. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=547.84s)]
*  If somebody had that heart cut in that sense, like they must be rich. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=550.88s)]
*  And sometimes they were. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  That's the real kicker there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=559.4s)]
*  They were. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=561.28s)]
*  Yeah, happy belated Easter, man. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=564.12s)]
*  Hope everybody had a nice time. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=565.6s)]
*  I hope everybody got to at least sit and spend time with a loved one. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=566.8s)]
*  You know, got to be around somebody that they cared about and and do something joyous. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=571.8s)]
*  I went down to Louisiana, which is a beautiful place down there, man. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=578.8s)]
*  It's a slower place. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=585.48s)]
*  You get down to Louisiana, man, a half hour will take 45 minutes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=588.76s)]
*  Ain't nobody in a rush to get through that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=593.88s)]
*  Somebody start a sentence at 11 a.m. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  and finish it up at about 1220. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  Like, damn. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=603.08s)]
*  Dang, boy, Mr. Eddie really got a gift of gab, they say. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=606.04s)]
*  But it's a real, you know, it's just a slow going. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=612.64s)]
*  You see somebody start yawning, somebody start yawning about four fifteen in the afternoon [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  and they won't stop till about five. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=622.36s)]
*  This is a slow pace. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=625.88s)]
*  It's just that, you know, it's that kind of place. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  Things take time. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=634.08s)]
*  And people even a hug takes time. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=636.38s)]
*  You hug somebody, that thing will last a minute or two. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=638.0400000000001s)]
*  You could take a small nap if you want. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=640.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, you hug somebody, it's just people. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=646.04s)]
*  There's not as much of a hurry. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=648.24s)]
*  There's a little more patience. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=652.0s)]
*  There's a little more peace, docility. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, there's something nice about that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=658.8s)]
*  There's something nice about the relaxation of it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=662.28s)]
*  And it's sweaty too down there, though. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=664.12s)]
*  You get down in Louisiana, you get down into some of these rural areas, baby. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=667.68s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about, as sweaty as can be. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=670.8s)]
*  It's hard to hug some people now. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  If they look thick or if they got a little bit of oil in their skin or, you know, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=678.24s)]
*  or if they too small, you can't even get a hug on somebody if they real bony. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=683.28s)]
*  Like, I can't. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  You can't. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=689.5600000000001s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=690.92s)]
*  You can't really get a good snatch on them because everybody's sweating down there. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=693.92s)]
*  People so sweaty. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=699.2s)]
*  You know, you see people try to shake hands and 20 times a hand slide right off. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  You can't even somebody put a watch on. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=705.88s)]
*  They can't get it on now. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=708.0s)]
*  Because of the sweat pouring out of people. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=711.24s)]
*  You know, there's just a lot going on down there, but we had a nice time. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=715.08s)]
*  We had a real nice time, man. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=719.36s)]
*  It was, what was it? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=722.76s)]
*  It was, you know, when I was in high school, I went and lived with a different family. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=724.84s)]
*  The fellow that raised me, that man, who was part of my life, he turned 80 years old. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=729.3599999999999s)]
*  And he getting older, baby now. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=735.52s)]
*  So we went down there and had his birthday and that was really nice. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=738.4s)]
*  And then went over to my brother's house for Easter. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=742.0s)]
*  And they had some good food over there, baby. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=747.9599999999999s)]
*  What did they have? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=751.4s)]
*  They had them little wiener, it's like wiener blanket. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=752.4s)]
*  It's not like a, it's like a little wiener blanket. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=762.64s)]
*  It looked like a piece of bread put a rear naked choke on a damn little wiener. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=768.84s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=774.6s)]
*  It's looked like, yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=775.6s)]
*  It's like, you know what I'm talking about? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=779.96s)]
*  It's just like a little, it's like a little wiener is wearing a little French bread as [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=783.32s)]
*  like a cape. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't know what it's called, but they had a whole little stack of M-Mitches and I got [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  in there. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=795.0s)]
*  And they had those finger sandwiches. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=797.4000000000001s)]
*  Somebody brought a tray at M and I cracked in at M. And some of those, you know, the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=799.12s)]
*  more the afternoon goes on, that meat gets a little hard. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=806.76s)]
*  And that's kind of when you find out who you are as a man, I think is the later in the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=812.3s)]
*  afternoon you're willing to eat a finger sandwich. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=817.52s)]
*  Because you see some dudes get real dicey with it too. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=821.2s)]
*  Some guys will only roll in later in the day, 5 p.m. or something around sundown. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=825.42s)]
*  And it was a 1 p.m. party. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=830.36s)]
*  It gets real hard on the outside. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=833.6s)]
*  On those little finger sandwich, a little bit of ham on that bastard. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=836.76s)]
*  You know, a little bit of Rot's Beef. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=840.32s)]
*  Somebody just... [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=842.68s)]
*  And some men, they go tongue first into that bit. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=844.56s)]
*  Some of those older men, that shit is like, damn, bruh. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=846.92s)]
*  Y'all need to lock that man up. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=851.88s)]
*  Or at least go through his hard drive. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=854.64s)]
*  That dude is on to, he's been doing, you know, that guy's got something going on in him. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=856.42s)]
*  Because his tongue is out here, he's out here tongue first into the world looking for something. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=862.76s)]
*  But if you see somebody go tongue first into the hard side of a finger sandwich... [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=868.58s)]
*  Dear God, baby, lock him up. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=875.2s)]
*  That's what I say. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=877.04s)]

*  It's been a long nine months. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1099.78s)]
*  They did. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1101.3400000000001s)]

*  the world really. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1165.02s)]

*  So you put more than four candles on a sugar treat, they fucking, they lose their edge, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1177.4199999999998s)]
*  you know? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1184.3s)]

*  It would trigger panic. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1194.2199999999998s)]
*  When the company ignored Kevin Burling's request and at a surprise lunchtime celebration, he [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1196.78s)]

*  probably don't even know your name, Mr. Burling. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1344.04s)]
*  So it's really a chance for you to kind of show out. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1347.84s)]
*  So when you, I think when you go into a group setting and you say, look, I don't want to [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1351.34s)]

*  Imagine suing because people wanted to show you love on your birthday. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1473.72s)]
*  Maybe he hated those people. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1479.12s)]
*  Maybe he hated working there. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1482.44s)]
*  I bet that's what it was. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=1485.12s)]

*  because time is not... [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2051.92s)]
*  Time is a... [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2056.92s)]
*  I mean, time don't even stop to tie its shoe. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2058.92s)]
*  It don't even know if it has shoes on. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2060.92s)]
*  It don't know if it's in sandals or boots [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2064.92s)]
*  or if it even has legs. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2066.92s)]
*  Time don't even stop to look down to see [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2069.92s)]
*  what it's rolling on. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2071.92s)]
*  If it's on damn wooden wheels [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2073.92s)]
*  or 24s or... [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2075.92s)]
*  Or ankles, it doesn't... [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2078.7200000000003s)]
*  It just keeps going. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2080.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, it's just like a... [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2084.7200000000003s)]
*  Just a... [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  Thoughtless wind. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2090.7200000000003s)]
*  But we need it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2093.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's why I like the Easter story. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2095.7200000000003s)]
*  That's why I like Jesus Christo [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2097.7200000000003s)]
*  popping back through and saying, hey, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  just letting y'all know when I'm ready [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2102.7200000000003s)]
*  to come back and change the game. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  When I'm ready to come back and do my magic, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2106.72s)]
*  I'm gonna come back and do my magic, you know? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2108.52s)]
*  It's nice that somebody pops in. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2110.52s)]
*  It's like when you're playing and you're a kid [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2112.52s)]
*  and somebody sticks their head in the door and is like, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2114.52s)]
*  hey, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2116.52s)]
*  letting y'all know I'm here. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2118.52s)]
*  So I like that, you know? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2120.52s)]
*  I like that every year somebody rolls back through [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2122.52s)]
*  and says, hey, time, I see you doing your thing, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2124.52s)]
*  but just letting you know [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2127.52s)]
*  I can do mine as well. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2129.52s)]
*  And that's a beautiful story there. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2131.52s)]
*  And our families, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2134.32s)]
*  I don't know what religion we were growing up. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2136.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2139.32s)]
*  We... [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2141.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2143.32s)]
*  I mean, we live close to a church. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2145.32s)]
*  We were sixth Baptist or something, I think, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2147.32s)]
*  or seventh Baptist. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2149.32s)]
*  We live right by a church [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2151.32s)]
*  and somebody definitely, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2153.32s)]
*  I'm not saying got molested, but [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2155.32s)]
*  somebody, you know, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2157.32s)]
*  somebody in our family probably got molested. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2159.32s)]
*  So we're whatever religion that is, baby. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2162.1200000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2164.1200000000003s)]
*  And yeah, I like traditions. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2166.1200000000003s)]
*  I like traditions because [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2168.1200000000003s)]
*  the more we lose traditions, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2170.1200000000003s)]
*  the more we lose [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2172.1200000000003s)]
*  contact with [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2175.1200000000003s)]
*  our forefathers and stuff. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2179.1200000000003s)]
*  It really is, you know? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2182.1200000000003s)]
*  And I know some people are like, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2183.1200000000003s)]
*  well, a lot of traditions are just business. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2184.1200000000003s)]
*  Right, but it's not about [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2186.1200000000003s)]
*  the family. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2188.1200000000003s)]
*  Right, but it's not about that really. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2190.12s)]
*  It's about the fact that you celebrate [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2192.12s)]
*  something that [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2194.12s)]
*  someone else celebrated. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2196.12s)]
*  That you [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2198.12s)]
*  you try and tell [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2200.12s)]
*  like this relentless thing, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2202.12s)]
*  this time that doesn't even [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2204.12s)]
*  give... [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2206.12s)]
*  You know, time doesn't even give... [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2208.12s)]
*  It gives you life, but you're like... [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2210.12s)]
*  It's so... [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2212.12s)]
*  It's so hard to really make an imprint [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2214.12s)]
*  in time. It's almost impossible. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2216.12s)]
*  But for me, I feel like [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2221.12s)]
*  small things like traditions and [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2223.12s)]
*  celebrating certain things every year, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2225.12s)]
*  it's a little bit like saying, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2227.12s)]
*  I'm going to try [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2229.12s)]
*  to put my stake in the ground here. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2231.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't remember what religion we were, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2233.12s)]
*  man. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2235.12s)]
*  Growing...or what? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2237.12s)]
*  Denomination. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2239.12s)]
*  But I remember [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2244.12s)]
*  one Christmas, somebody [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2246.12s)]
*  had driven through a fence [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2248.12s)]
*  in our area. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2250.12s)]
*  Somebody had a fence. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2252.12s)]
*  And somebody had driven through it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2254.12s)]
*  Because people [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2256.12s)]
*  get jealous and shit and drunk [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2258.12s)]
*  and like, oh, this motherfucker's got a fence. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2260.12s)]
*  Bam! You know? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2262.12s)]
*  And somebody drove through that bitch. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2264.12s)]
*  And so, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2268.12s)]
*  I went over there one time and was hanging out [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2270.12s)]
*  with one of the kids over there. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2272.12s)]
*  And we started making stuff out of wood. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2274.12s)]
*  And I made my sister this [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2276.12s)]
*  like a thing to keep her dolls in or something. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2280.12s)]
*  That was probably about maybe 11. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2282.12s)]
*  So then I remember I'm walking home one night [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2286.12s)]
*  and I passed this family's house. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2288.12s)]
*  They had a rental home right on the corner. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2290.12s)]
*  And this man that lived [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2292.12s)]
*  there was Elvis impersonator. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2294.12s)]
*  And he had [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2296.12s)]
*  four children, I think, and they all [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2298.12s)]
*  stayed in the yard and wore like... [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2300.12s)]
*  I think they were Pentecostal. They wore [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2302.12s)]
*  clothes all the way down. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2304.12s)]
*  Past their feet. I mean, it looked like [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2306.12s)]
*  they were sleeping bags with heads. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2308.12s)]
*  You know, the whole family. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2310.12s)]
*  And the daddy was in the garage making one of the children a shirt out of wood. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2312.12s)]
*  And he was alcoholic. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2318.12s)]
*  And I went in there and I remember [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2320.12s)]
*  and tried to help him put that together for his son for Christmas. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2322.12s)]
*  And his son used to vomit on the bus. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2326.12s)]
*  And I don't even know if you ever got an education. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2330.12s)]
*  I don't know what the hell class he even went to. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2332.12s)]
*  I just remember... [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2334.12s)]
*  The only thing I remember about the kid is that he had... [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2335.12s)]
*  He was losing his hair at a young age and he used to vomit on the bus. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2338.12s)]
*  He was basically like a 50-year-old man. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2341.12s)]
*  He was almost like an older alcoholic, the kid, but he was just a kid. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2343.12s)]
*  All right, let's get into a few questions and stuff that came here. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2346.12s)]

*  I had just relapsed, and you called me back then [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2391.12s)]
*  and talked with me, kind of lifted my spirits up. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2396.12s)]

*  I'm happier than I've ever been. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2411.12s)]
*  Everything's good. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2413.12s)]
*  I just wanted to give you an update and let you know everything is good. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2415.12s)]
*  And I think a lot of it has to do with you calling me that day. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2418.12s)]
*  It meant the world to me. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2423.12s)]
*  And I just wanted you to know that you're a good dude, man. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2425.12s)]
*  Well, thanks, bro. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2429.12s)]
*  I appreciate the name. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2431.12s)]
*  You know, that's sweet of you to say, man. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2433.12s)]
*  You know, I think a lot of that goes to you. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2436.12s)]
*  For just taking care of yourself, it's tough. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2439.12s)]
*  And to try something new and try something different is tough. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2441.12s)]
*  And yeah, and thank you for just reaching out and saying the nice words. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2444.12s)]
*  You know, I'm happy for you. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2450.12s)]
*  You sound good. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2452.12s)]
*  And I appreciate you calling. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2455.12s)]
*  I'll have to go back and check that out. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2457.12s)]
*  I'm happy for you. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2459.12s)]
*  You sound good. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2460.12s)]
*  And that's nice. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2463.12s)]
*  That's a nice way to sound, brother. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2464.12s)]
*  Amen. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2466.12s)]
*  Let's hit another call or two that came in. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2468.12s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2473.12s)]
*  This one actually, this is kind of in the same vein. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2474.12s)]
*  Hey, Theo. My name's Robert. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2477.12s)]
*  I just wanted to call in and say hey. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2479.12s)]
*  I'd like to let you know I appreciate you, man. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2482.12s)]
*  I've been listening to you for the last few years. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2484.12s)]
*  And honestly, I don't know why I'm calling. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2486.12s)]
*  Thanks for calling, Robert. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2491.12s)]
*  And that's long for Robbie. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2492.12s)]
*  People say Robbie or Rob, Bob. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2494.12s)]
*  Robo, they call them sometime. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2498.12s)]
*  Robert. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2502.12s)]
*  I think it's French actually. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2503.12s)]
*  Robert. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2505.12s)]
*  Robert. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2507.12s)]
*  Somebody that's Robert-ing. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2508.12s)]
*  It's not a verb. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2510.12s)]
*  Onward. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2511.12s)]
*  I think you're really relatable as far as human being and human beings. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2514.12s)]
*  I wanted to get your opinion. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2518.12s)]
*  I'm kind of on my first real stint of sobriety right now. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2521.12s)]
*  I'm about to come up on my 90-day mark. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2525.12s)]
*  The first part was real easy even now. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2529.12s)]
*  I'm starting to have these conversations in my head where I'm negotiating with myself. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2531.12s)]
*  Maybe I'm not an alcoholic. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2536.12s)]
*  I'm trying to work through my steps and stuff. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2538.12s)]
*  I'm getting closer and closer to talking to myself and reaching for the bottle again. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2543.12s)]
*  I just wanted to get your opinion and see if there's anything that can really be... [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2548.12s)]
*  Thanks for the call, man. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2554.12s)]
*  I think what you're expressing is what a lot of people express if they are about to go out of their program and not be sober. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2557.12s)]
*  It's a risky place to be in. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2570.12s)]
*  Because there will be things that will call you back into the world. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2576.12s)]
*  It's happened to me many times. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2579.12s)]
*  I'm just recommitting myself now to my program. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2581.12s)]
*  I just hit a meeting this morning. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2585.12s)]
*  There's a lot of old people in this meeting. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2590.12s)]
*  Some of them start falling asleep. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2593.12s)]
*  One guy I think was in the war, I guess. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2595.12s)]
*  I don't even know what war it could have been. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2597.12s)]
*  But he'll like... [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2601.12s)]
*  And other guys are just old so they just have sounds come out of them. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2603.12s)]
*  Like... [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2610.12s)]
*  Old people, some of them, like a gas will just come out of their arm. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2615.12s)]
*  Their bodies just kind of... [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2622.12s)]
*  It's like a hot spring almost at a certain point where they're just little... [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2627.12s)]
*  They'll move their elbow and it'll just like an exhaust. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2634.12s)]
*  It's just a lot of old people making all these sounds around me. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2641.12s)]
*  It sounds like there's a lot of sounds in there. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2645.12s)]
*  But anyway, I was just thinking about that. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2650.12s)]
*  The only thoughts I have are it's really tough to recommit yourself once you start going down that slope. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2655.12s)]
*  I've tried a lot of different things over time. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2662.12s)]
*  Thinking that I didn't have some sort of problem or not knowing what my problem or not knowing what my... [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2669.12s)]
*  Problem or difficulty was. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2676.12s)]
*  I mean, it's all your own choice. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2681.12s)]
*  Nobody can tell you what to do. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2683.12s)]
*  It's definitely... [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2687.12s)]
*  I've seen the crossroads a bunch and I've been there myself where you kind of lean in or you're leaning out. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2689.12s)]
*  But I applaud you on 90 days, brother. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2697.12s)]
*  Congratulations, man. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2699.12s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2700.12s)]
*  And I just wish you the best, whatever you're doing. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2701.12s)]
*  And nobody knows if you are an alcoholic or if you have that thing or some form of it except for you. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2704.12s)]
*  You're the only one that knows. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2711.12s)]
*  Love you, baby. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2715.12s)]
*  Take care of yourself, brother gang. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2716.12s)]
*  What else? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2721.12s)]
*  We had some other good calls that came in here. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2722.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2727.12s)]
*  Let's hit this one. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2728.12s)]
*  Hey, Theo. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2730.12s)]
*  This is Brendan out of New Hampshire by way of Boston. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2731.12s)]
*  And I was just calling in because I feel I really can relate to some of your family troubles, man. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2737.12s)]
*  Like, so you've been talking about your mom and I have a similar issue with my mom. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2744.12s)]
*  I, you know, I'm not going to get into it because it's not pretty. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2753.12s)]
*  But sometimes your trust goes away. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2757.12s)]
*  And my dad was he was never really, you know, in the scene. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2762.12s)]
*  He was doing his own thing. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2767.12s)]
*  He's like he's a hyper intelligent individual. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2769.12s)]
*  And he wasn't there for me. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2773.12s)]
*  But have my my my trust broken from my mom made me feel like I had no one really. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2776.12s)]
*  I was just wondering, you know, is forgiveness in us because I try to forgive so much, but then oftentimes I dwell on, you know, why why they wronged me. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2784.12s)]
*  And this goes for my brother, my dad, my mom. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2797.12s)]
*  Yes, it's a good call, man. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2801.12s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2804.12s)]
*  Thank you for calling. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2805.12s)]
*  And it's funny. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2807.12s)]
*  This is the first time I've ever heard of this. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2808.12s)]
*  Thank you for calling. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2811.12s)]
*  And it's funny. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2812.12s)]
*  This is kind of right where I am. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2814.12s)]
*  You know, during the holiday during Easter, I got to see my mother and see my brother and my mother's going to be moving to Arizona. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2815.12s)]
*  And, you know, this may have been the last time I get to see her in in Louisiana, you know, and and she's moving to Tucson, Arizona. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2823.12s)]
*  And she also oh she trying to get a weapon to so if anybody does tactical sales or tactical training out there that can help like an older woman do it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2838.12s)]
*  Hit up the producer email because we got to get mama. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2849.12s)]
*  We got to get that thing on, you know, so. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2854.12s)]
*  And she had to be a piece that she could handle, you know, so that would be awesome if somebody could could, you know, help help with that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2858.12s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2867.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2870.12s)]
*  It's tough because it's like, yeah, how do how long do I hold a grudge, you know? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2872.12s)]
*  And then because at a certain point, your parents, they're just getting older and you're missing out on whatever there is there. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2879.12s)]
*  And yeah, I think I believe. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2892.12s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons why I'm trying to recommit myself to my program is because I believe that forgiveness is the only answer. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2896.12s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2908.12s)]
*  Letting go of whatever that hurt is. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2911.12s)]
*  You know, sometimes I felt so hurt as a kid, I felt the I hold on to that hurt because sometimes it's the only relationship I had with my mother was. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2917.12s)]
*  That I was angry at her. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2930.12s)]
*  You know, and it's all I had to always the only thing that I had. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2936.12s)]
*  So it was like so hard to let it go. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2939.12s)]
*  It's been hard to let it go. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2941.12s)]
*  Because the only thing that I had. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2945.12s)]
*  Was my anger. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2953.12s)]
*  Or my uncomfort or my pain. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2955.12s)]
*  It was so hard to let it go. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2958.12s)]
*  It's like a blanket, you know, it's a. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2961.12s)]
*  It's like I know this isn't good for me, but somehow it keeps me warm a little. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2966.12s)]
*  You know, the only thing I had, we know when I was young and I'm not talking about self pity here or anything like that. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2976.12s)]
*  I'm just I'm trying to really examine this like why we hold on to those things. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2983.12s)]
*  Because, yeah, all I all I for a long time, all I had was my just my anger. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=2993.12s)]
*  And my I was wronged my that that, you know, is somebody's all I had was that. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3000.12s)]
*  And when you have that from a young age with a parent, it's. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3007.12s)]
*  That's like it's not even you holding on to it as a conscious adult. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3010.12s)]
*  It's this fucking it's this inner child that's got this claws on him. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3016.12s)]
*  You know, he got them grips, the mitts, baby. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3021.12s)]
*  And so it's hard to let go of some of that. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3027.12s)]
*  But I just I just believe that the only way to do it, the only way to really get free is to have some forgiveness, you know. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3032.12s)]
*  And people do the best they can. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3041.12s)]
*  You know, I saw my mother this weekend and. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3047.12s)]
*  And all any of us are is just kids that are just getting older, you know, and just trying our best in the world. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3053.12s)]
*  And sometimes it takes time. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3062.12s)]
*  You can't really force it, you know, but but I think we can get into practices that help us get closer to forgiveness. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3065.12s)]
*  And and that's where I want to be. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3073.12s)]
*  Because at a certain point, I'm tired of. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3079.12s)]
*  Of the grudges, I'm tired, even if I'm not the one making them, even if they're from a young, I've got to talk to myself or have a relationship enough with my heart. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3085.12s)]
*  That's like, hey, trust me enough to walk us through this. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3097.12s)]
*  And with my higher power. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3104.12s)]
*  To say, hey, God, help me get help me walk through this. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3108.12s)]
*  You know, help me. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3115.12s)]
*  You know, I have felt unloved or I have felt wronged or I felt this help me. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3119.12s)]
*  Try again. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3127.12s)]
*  To give this person a chance to love me, because if not. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3131.12s)]
*  I miss out twice. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3137.12s)]
*  I miss out as a child. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3141.12s)]
*  When I didn't wasn't able to make a choice. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3145.12s)]
*  When I when when when I had it was all survival instincts that I had to to operate from. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3148.12s)]
*  But I miss out as an adult when I am able to make a choice. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3155.12s)]
*  And. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3162.12s)]
*  And as hard as it is, I don't want to miss out on getting to love my mother twice. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3171.12s)]
*  You know. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3182.12s)]
*  And I don't know if that makes a ton of sense or not. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3189.12s)]
*  And fuck, I don't even know if I care if it does. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3191.12s)]
*  You know, it's been for me, it's been a long journey with this kind of stuff and trying to navigate it. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3197.12s)]
*  And that's OK. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3202.12s)]
*  You know. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3204.12s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3207.12s)]
*  So but I wish you well there, brother. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3208.12s)]
*  And and just know that there's other people out there that are on this journey with you in some ways. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3211.12s)]
*  It could be a mother, it could be a father, it could be it could be a sibling. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3217.12s)]
*  And it could be ourselves. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3221.12s)]
*  Sometimes a lot of it for me is about forgiving. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3223.12s)]
*  Myself. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3227.12s)]
*  You know, when you are. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3230.12s)]
*  As children, you think it's your fault. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3234.12s)]
*  You know, you take some respect, you take so much responsibility for yourself that if something isn't right, then of course it's on me. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3236.12s)]
*  It's on me. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3243.12s)]
*  But if stuff's on you for so long, it's on me, it's on me, it's on me. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3247.12s)]
*  You can handle that for a while, but I think at a certain point, you're right. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3251.12s)]
*  It's all on you. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3255.12s)]
*  And it's just you. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3257.12s)]
*  And it gets kind of lonesome, you know. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3259.12s)]
*  And I'm not saying that in a self pity way. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3262.12s)]
*  I'm just saying that and like, you know, I want my life to be filled with other people. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3264.12s)]
*  And and so that's hopefully that is a direction that I can head in, you know, with the help of others and with the help of a higher power. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3268.12s)]
*  You know, I've been there before and and I think I can be there again. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3281.12s)]
*  But gang gang, baby, take care of yourself. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3287.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And I got this new gang gang hitter right here, too. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3289.12s)]
*  Well, this is a baby blue and it's a large and the large one's a little big on this one. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3291.12s)]
*  So I don't know if I go medium. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3297.12s)]
*  I feel good in here. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3299.12s)]
*  I feel like somebody should have lost under this baby's arms, though. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3303.12s)]
*  That's for damn sure. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3305.12s)]
*  And if you can't get well, brother, you can always get you one of them weighted blankets. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3308.12s)]

*  Yeah, I think it's interesting that Elon is trying to buy Twitter. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3659.12s)]
*  I like it. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3667.12s)]
*  You know, I like to see... [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3668.12s)]
*  You know, free speech has been... [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3670.12s)]
*  It's not what it used to be. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3674.12s)]
*  It's not. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3676.12s)]
*  You know, and a lot of media, it's all owned by the same couple of organizations and types of people. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3679.12s)]
*  And you're not allowed to say certain things. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3686.12s)]
*  You know, I know on Twitter they shut down certain political views and political stories. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3691.12s)]
*  They won't even let them be shared on there. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3698.12s)]
*  Whereas other ones, they will. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3700.12s)]
*  You know, certain schools of thought and ideas, they won't allow. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3702.12s)]
*  And others, they will. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3706.12s)]
*  And it's a dump. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3708.12s)]
*  It's a dump. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3710.12s)]
*  And it's just about power and control. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3712.12s)]
*  And people are sick of it. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3714.12s)]
*  People are... [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3718.12s)]
*  I mean, it's literally making people sick. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3719.12s)]
*  You know, you take away somebody's voice and it... [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3721.12s)]
*  For some of it, it's the only thing you have that's yours. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3725.12s)]
*  You know, and I've been a victim of a... [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3731.12s)]
*  I've been a contributor of it myself and being afraid to even say what I really want to say sometimes. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3735.12s)]
*  Being afraid to speak up for myself. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3742.12s)]
*  Afraid that I won't be able to... [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3744.12s)]
*  That I'll lose my ability to even have a job or have a space. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3747.12s)]
*  You know, and that's scary. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3752.12s)]
*  I mean, that is... [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3758.12s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3761.12s)]
*  So any chance I see where somebody who wants to even the score a little bit is trying to make that happen. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3763.12s)]
*  I like that because you put so much pressure on... [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3772.12s)]
*  You make things so unfair for so long, I just don't think it's going to end well. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3776.12s)]
*  And... [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3782.12s)]
*  And I don't know what exactly that means, but... [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3788.12s)]
*  But damn, I mean, you're going to see... [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3792.12s)]
*  You know, if people can't speak at a certain point, they're going to... [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3795.12s)]
*  They're going to fight for their voice. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3800.12s)]
*  I think. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3804.12s)]
*  So more power to them. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3806.12s)]
*  You know? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3809.12s)]
*  I think Twitter's long been a shithole. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3810.12s)]
*  It's long been a shithole. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3815.12s)]
*  And so... [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3818.12s)]
*  I hope Elon flushes it. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3821.12s)]
*  What else here, man? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3826.12s)]
*  A lot of great calls that have come in, you know? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3827.12s)]
*  And I hate to not be able to get to all of them. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3829.12s)]
*  Let's take another call. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3833.12s)]
*  D-O-1! What, dude? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3838.12s)]
*  It's Brandon out of Amarillo. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3842.12s)]
*  Brandon, baby, out of Amarillo. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3844.12s)]
*  That's a Spanish animal, baby. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3847.12s)]
*  That's a good place down there, I think. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3850.12s)]
*  I've never been. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3852.12s)]
*  Onward. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3853.12s)]
*  Getting excited to see that Dallas show, boy. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3855.12s)]
*  Man, real excited you're coming down here to Texas. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3859.12s)]
*  Just wanted to call to let you know who's listening out here. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3861.12s)]
*  Man, I'm a commercial painter. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3864.12s)]
*  I hear you talking to my earbuds every day, dude. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3866.12s)]
*  Gets me through the day. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3868.12s)]
*  Keeps my mind out of the dark arts, if you feel me. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3870.12s)]
*  But man, just appreciate everything. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3874.12s)]
*  Getting excited to see it. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3876.12s)]
*  Gang, baby, thanks, Brandon. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3879.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that too down there in Dallas at the Wind Spear. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3880.12s)]
*  And it's a beautiful venue. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3883.12s)]
*  What else do we have to say here? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3886.12s)]
*  What else is going on? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3887.12s)]
*  Gang, gang. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3893.12s)]
*  Hey, Phil, what's up, man? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3894.12s)]
*  Just getting ready to do a little pre-Easter egg hunt with the kids and them. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3896.12s)]
*  Single dads, so I don't get to have them every weekend. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3902.12s)]
*  But anyways, I just wanted to ask you and your listeners, like, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3906.12s)]
*  what are some things that they did your parents or relatives did for Easter? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3910.12s)]
*  Like, we always hit eggs and you find them. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3917.12s)]
*  Some have chocolates. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3921.12s)]
*  Some have, I guess, other things. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3922.12s)]
*  But a big thing, I guess, in Asian culture, Thai culture, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3925.12s)]
*  we had our parents hide money in the plastic eggs. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3931.12s)]
*  So some of them would have panties. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3935.12s)]
*  I think one of them I found had a $10 bill, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3938.12s)]
*  which that shit was gold when you were like, you know, four or five. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3940.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, baby, that's beautiful. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3946.12s)]
*  And y'all did it. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3949.12s)]
*  Thai, you guys are Thai because you sound white. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3950.12s)]
*  You shocked everybody when you tied us, when you tied out there. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3954.12s)]
*  Yeah, what did we do? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3960.12s)]
*  You know, my mother would make Easter baskets, you know, and hide them. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3961.12s)]
*  And what else would we do? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3970.12s)]
*  We probably had to clean usually. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3971.12s)]
*  My mom made us clean a lot. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3974.12s)]
*  So I didn't mind cleaning because you get the fumes, baby. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3975.12s)]
*  You get those fumes going in the bathroom. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3979.12s)]
*  I'd be in there pouring bleach. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3981.12s)]
*  I'd pour bleach in the toilet and stir it with that cleaner thing, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3983.12s)]
*  little cleaner stick, and just get that hit, baby. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3988.12s)]
*  That hot bowl hit, son. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3993.12s)]
*  Get that Easter, that freaking resurrection, bro, right up in my lungs, baby. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=3997.12s)]
*  Let the Lord show up in your lungs. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4004.12s)]
*  So, yeah, I think we would clean on Easter, and we would probably just play, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4008.12s)]
*  spend time with our neighbors. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4014.12s)]
*  You know, people would burn stuff in the ditch around then [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4016.12s)]
*  because it was spring cleaning. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4019.12s)]
*  So you'd see a lot of ditch fires, and we would, after the fires would go down, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4021.12s)]
*  a lot of us would get wet and get out in there and get the ash on ourselves, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4029.12s)]
*  do ash Wednesday, ash Thursday, ash Sunday, ash Tuesday. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4033.12s)]
*  We'd be out there damn ashed out, you know. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4037.12s)]
*  I mean, we'd look, you'd almost look black to a lot of people. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4040.12s)]
*  Some, I remember a black mother in our neighborhood told us to fucking get in the house. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4043.12s)]
*  We're like, we're not even your kids. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4046.12s)]
*  So we'd get all, you know, we'd just party with whatever was in the ditch usually. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4049.12s)]
*  Because springtime, people did spring cleaning, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4054.12s)]
*  and people would throw stuff in the ditch and then burn it. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4056.12s)]
*  So you'd either get a pile of ash or you'd get stuff that wouldn't burn yet. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4059.12s)]
*  Get you half a shiffer robe or something. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4063.12s)]
*  Get that bitch going, you know. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4066.12s)]
*  You sit out there and play office or, you know, get you half a desk or something. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4068.12s)]
*  You play doctor or, you know, playing parent. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsnTII8Ll0&t=4072.12s)]
