Video Description: Mitch Candiano is a Carny from Lawrence, MA whose family has been in the carnival business for more than 100 years. He has worked numerous roles in multiple carnivals all along the east coast. 

Theo is joined by a Carny to chat about the wild life of a carnival worker. They talk about the difference between carnivals and fairs, his personal connection to freak shows (and a three-legged man), games that used to rip people off, smoking weed with one of the munchkins from the Wizard of Oz, rivalries between different groups of carnies, how he saw the business change over the years, and much more.

*  So that's what we are and I know there's all different versions. I know people sometimes [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=164.16s)]
*  think of like a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=168.8s)]
*  Somebody that just got out of prison covered in tattoos smelling like cabbage, you know missing a couple fingers and they think that's a carny [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=170.56s)]

*  We don't we carnies don't call him carnies. We call him like 40 milers or green help or something like that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=181.96s)]
*  Cuz like a 40 mile it he's just trying to get onto the road and get 40 miles down the street to the next lot [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  So you get out of whatever situation he was in when he joined the carnival? Okay, so there's different types [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=192.2s)]
*  You have actual carnies that are like they've been in there for a while. Yeah, like their families are out there [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=197.44s)]
*  They have kids they raise their kids out there and then you got 40 milers [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=206.36s)]
*  We call them 40 milers and those are guys that are just kind of like maybe just got out of doing some time and they're just [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=206.6s)]
*  Trying to try to get a job and you know get out of town and get out of town [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, just trying to get there for just something [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=216.16s)]
*  Yeah, and so a lot of times the carnival will hire folks like that just because they need like a lot of short [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=218.12s)]
*  Stuff to find help out there, you know people that want to travel and just be out there every day [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=223.92s)]
*  And you know living at the carnival. Yeah, and you're in a different town every week and you know, you don't get much time off [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=227.88s)]
*  So it's wild. Yeah, it's interesting. Well, it's kind of interesting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  it's kind of similar to comedians because you go to a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Town or a city for a few days and then you hit the road and you go to somewhere else. Yeah. Yeah [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=240.48s)]
*  I'd say like that's like the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  Calling like a open mic or like a comic is kind of like calling one of those ride guys at Carney is kind of like the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=247.88s)]
*  Same thing, you know, okay. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes good sense, man [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=253.44s)]
*  And your family's been doing he said hundreds of years. Well since 1918 my grandfather started selling cotton candy in 1918 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=257.6s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, and what brought him into that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=264.6s)]
*  I'm really not sure he came over from Italy when he was born in 1900 [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=266.96s)]
*  and so he was about four or five years old came over on the boat to Ellis Island and all that and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=271.24s)]
*  I don't know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=276.08s)]
*  he was 18 years old and started selling cotton candy at like street fairs and little things like that and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=277.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's just kind of how we started and got into it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=283.12s)]
*  I actually still have some cotton candy machines that he built handmade like wooden frame and like, you know belt driven like old old school [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  They obviously don't work but because they're now they're like all sturdy metal like, you know [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=291.88000000000005s)]
*  Industrial looking like now pool makes him. Yeah. Yeah something like that. But um, yeah, we have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=296.24s)]
*  Fucking sock in it or whatever. You're like this is like one of these you're looking at. Yeah, so we have a couple like that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=302.6s)]
*  Other older those are kind of like the those kind of seem like residential ones that you can kind of like buy for your house [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=309.12s)]
*  so your grandfather came over and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=315.44s)]
*  He started selling cotton. So he started cotton candy. Yeah, he's selling cotton candy and then [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=318.6s)]
*  Like what he just gets a job he stays like he just kept doing it and then you know [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=323.56s)]
*  He had kids and then my father got into it and my father mother started their own whole carnival business [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=328.32s)]
*  They started buying rides and games and food and everything and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, we had a whole carnival called candy on those amusements, you know way back before I was born and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=338.8s)]
*  Then when I was born they kind of split up [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  And my dad started working for bigger carnivals like the real big ones that did big the big county fairs and state fairs and so [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  Wow, yeah [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=355.04s)]
*  So he started working for a company like that and then went for ended up [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  Working for another the biggest one in New England called Fiesta shows [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=360.68s)]
*  And so he worked for them up until he died. And so he was kind of like, you know [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  Big shot out there. He ran like food and games and stuff for him out there and was a lot man [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=369.12s)]
*  So what and so did you was one of your first jobs in the carnival? Yeah [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=377.82s)]
*  And so what's the difference between a carnival and a fair because we had the fair would come a lot [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=378.32s)]
*  Yeah, so the fair is the same thing [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's basically except the fair is they have like the animals and everything like that like you have the whole [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=385.86s)]
*  Agricultural part of it, you know, and sometimes they'll have like demolition derbies and oh, yeah [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  all that and like the races and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  All the agricultural like the pay they had definitely yeah all that stuff [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=399.52s)]
*  So that's what kind of distinguishes it from a fair to a carnival and they kind of been long-running like up [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=403.61999999999995s)]
*  Well, we are we have the Topsfield fair. It's been around for like 150 years or something like that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=408.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=413.08s)]
*  How does that 4h element fit in because that's also a whole different element than the rides in the game? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=413.55999999999995s)]
*  That's kind of you would always like I remember we'd always have to walk over to like the livestock [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  shed or whatever is like a bomb shelter whatever they had a [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=423.79999999999995s)]
*  Higgs in it and stuff and you'd have to go over there and that pig races [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  You ever see those yeah, and they have like the kids art like you'd won my third place or whatever. It was pretty bad [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=431.28s)]
*  Jesus Christ like they hid it over here behind the goat [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=437.52s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't that great of heart, but you'd be able to go over there and like they had like crocheting and a lot of local [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=440.56s)]
*  Crafts, but uh, did you guys ever have beef? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=447.16s)]
*  Was there like a lot of like beef between corny's and the live was in the carnivals between the carnival? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=450.12s)]
*  Wow, like so during the spring when we're doing just carnivals [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=457.26s)]
*  We would split up into like three different sections so you could do three cities at the same time [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=461.94s)]
*  But then when we got to the fairs we would all get together and then the fights would break out [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=466.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like crazy fights. So what was a lot of the beef between the people though the workers? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=470.28s)]
*  Oh, I'm a first unit [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=475.68s)]
*  No, you know, you're just a lonely from guy from the third unit like, you know [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=477.32s)]
*  You shouldn't be over here like with us or partying with us. So hey, you know [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=480.96s)]
*  They kind of look down on you like it's just like anything else [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=485.08s)]
*  You know the first unit got all the big rides and the nice stuff and then the second unit was kind of stepped out [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=488.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=493.28s)]
*  And then the third unit was like they got all the shit all the bad rides all the bad stuff [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=493.72s)]
*  So whenever they all teamed up, there's all these beefs going on like, you know [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=498.16s)]
*  Territorial stuff territorial stuff. Yeah. Yeah, huh? So like what was your first job in it? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=503.64000000000004s)]

*  Mm-hmm. And so as soon as high school was done for the summer, we'd go out on the road until [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2420.86s)]
*  You know school started back up and so I'd bring a couple of friends with me out there do EJ and [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2425.62s)]
*  We we'd set up like our own tent city away from everybody so we could party and not bother anybody [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2431.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we'd have a nice campfire. We even brought in we used to travel with a lizard with us, too [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2436.18s)]
*  We always brought him with us. We had a nice little cage for him and he was our little buddy [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2442.42s)]
*  Set him up. Yeah, and we just drink we had out [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2446.34s)]
*  We had all our tents and nice fire going and we'd party out there a couple men and a lizard rust like the Bible on our party [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2448.54s)]
*  You know like a whatever the new Bible the right will be yeah [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2454.48s)]

*  Yeah, it was fun man. And um, yeah a lot of people slept in their games [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2459.84s)]
*  So that would be it you just crash in there and they would just pop it back open in the morning [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2464.88s)]
*  Yep, okay roll your sleeping bag up put it under the counter and what were some of the other rides man? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2468.56s)]

*  Yeah, like boats [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2479.44s)]
*  They would go upside down so you were closed in and they just want like this they were opposite [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2481.44s)]
*  They would swing opposite of each other and then they'd go upside down and sometimes they would hold you up there [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2486.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and hold you while you're upside down and you could shake it and like shake everybody's money out of their pockets [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2490.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there it is [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2496.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, this was for the big kids. I don't think I went on this at the time [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2498.4s)]
*  Yeah, I used to run that sometimes so it was really easy to tear down and set up [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2502.4s)]
*  So it was really easy to tear down and set up and sometimes I would run it and you're in the doghouse [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2507.12s)]
*  And you know, it's just a kind of just a remote control like a little joystick [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2511.68s)]
*  You get it going you rock it back and forth until you get enough energy to get it up and around [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2514.88s)]
*  And you can hold it up there and you'd hold it and you just shake it a little bit and wiggle it [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2518.96s)]
*  So it would go back and forth a little bit you start shaking the money out of their pockets [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2523.04s)]
*  So it all falls down. Although one time there was a bad scene bad scene [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2526.16s)]
*  Because you're always supposed to wait till the end of the ride [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2530.48s)]
*  To go pick up the money [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2533.12s)]
*  Well a kid who ran it all the time was trying to be a daredevil and he ran through [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2534.72s)]
*  To get the money while it was on while the ride was still in while he was up top ended up getting hit [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2539.76s)]

*  Is that one of the worst accidents you've ever seen out there? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2574.08s)]
*  That was probably the worst. Yeah [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2577.04s)]
*  We were running that skydiver one time and the you know [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2581.12s)]

*  I don't even know the official name [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2691.04s)]
*  And if what what ride caused the most vomit you think the puke barrel really probably it was uh, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2693.04s)]
*  It looked like one of those metal 55 gallon drums, you know those metal like garbage can barrels, but it was huge [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2698.64s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, you know and so it was massive and say it was on its side and you go in it had a sliding door [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2704.88s)]
*  And you go in and then there were two seats [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2710.96s)]
*  That people could sit in circle seats and they'll spun like this while the floor rocked back and forth like this [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2713.6s)]
*  And the outside barrels spun like this with strobe lights going on inside. I mean of course who's not gonna puke [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2718.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty wild. Yeah, it's good stuff [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2725.84s)]
*  So we actually owned one of those candy on as my mom and dad owned a couple of them actually would have been so [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2730.08s)]
*  They split up when I was like a year old so they ended up. I was too young to kind of [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2735.44s)]
*  Help with the business. So my mom sold most of the rides by the time I was [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2740.2400000000002s)]
*  You know a teenager or so we still had some stuff kitty rides and stuff [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2745.04s)]
*  But we had gotten rid of she had gotten rid of all the major rides that she had had. Yeah [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  Bring that video up yours gonna show us [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2753.04s)]
*  And now what do you do when something [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  What is this? What is this here? Oh, that's looks like the [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2759.2799999999997s)]
*  We call them the 1001 nights. I'm not sure what this version is called, but that's what it was [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2762.64s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, it looks like the whole thing is shaking. So people are going and jumping on the side to like hold it down [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2767.04s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2773.68s)]
*  Yeah, what do you a carnival ride in Traverse City, Michigan suddenly malfunctioned [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2775.9199999999996s)]
*  What do you do when this kind of thing happens? What do y'all do shut it the f down? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2780.4s)]
*  But how do you [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2785.52s)]
*  I mean people are trying to save this thing from falling over. Yeah, they're all trying to get some weight on it [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2787.2s)]
*  Is that a realistic approach you think is that safe or would you tell the people? I mean it could be [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2792.56s)]
*  Oh [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2798.4s)]
*  because [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2799.36s)]
*  that was one of the things about the carnival you always felt like [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2800.64s)]
*  Nobody had your back in a way. Yeah, which was something exciting about it [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2805.52s)]
*  And deathly alarming like isn't it and you felt like if you died they wouldn't tell your parents [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2810.96s)]
*  Yeah, I could I mean we've probably buried some bodies out back [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2817.92s)]
*  I mean in the haunted house, probably some of those bodies in there probably kids that just never made it out [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2821.52s)]
*  Yes, but i'll be honest with you though the carnival rides are uh, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2828.48s)]
*  It's a lot safer than probably music parks amusement parks really? Yeah, because they get inspected every week [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2830.88s)]
*  So you're getting state inspectors every single week every time you set up they have to come in and like [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2837.2000000000003s)]
*  And uh, you know give it a go ahead. So what's the worst accident you've ever seen out there? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2842.0s)]
*  So that was I mean, I didn't see the kid get hit by the sky master, but that was probably the worst [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2848.1600000000003s)]
*  Although at one fair that I was at a topsfield fair [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2853.52s)]
*  I forget the name of the ride, but somebody did come flying out of it, but they didn't die or I can [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2857.1200000000003s)]
*  I wish I could remember the ride [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2863.6000000000004s)]
*  But they always say those people didn't die, but you never see those people anymore. Yeah [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2866.8s)]
*  That's true. You know or like they're like, yeah, they yeah janet didn't die and they're like well then why isn't yeah [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2871.84s)]
*  Where is she? Yeah. Oh, she went to florida. She retired. Yeah people. Yeah, she retired. She's 11. Yeah [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2878.1600000000003s)]
*  Where did she [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2885.92s)]
*  So that's just the thing I think sometimes about that kind of stuff that seems like a little bit tricky man [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2887.84s)]
*  Where like I was saying they um, like I did they uh, they do inspect them a lot more than like your [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2892.64s)]
*  Regular music parks. I mean that are just set up year-round [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2898.24s)]
*  They only got like one or two inspections a year. Oh, yeah [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2902.0s)]
*  And so but the carnival like they have to get state inspected every week every time you set up in a new place [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2904.56s)]
*  so [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2909.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. Wow. I didn't I I did not [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2911.04s)]
*  Expect that yeah, because it seems like they're not even you know where the shady part comes in is where like [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2913.82s)]
*  Say something breaks or something happens during the week and then it gets fixed [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2920.88s)]
*  Not up to par in between inspections in between inspections [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2925.52s)]
*  And you just got to have the ride you got to have it going you got to make the money [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2929.84s)]
*  Yeah, and then so you have you have [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2932.8s)]
*  Your main ride guys. So all the ride formants have to do a once inspection [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2936.2400000000002s)]
*  every day and they have to fill out a form and say they inspected their ride, I mean, but [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2940.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2945.2799999999997s)]
*  And then you have the ride super who's in charge of all those guys and his heel yeah [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=2947.8399999999997s)]

*  I think he even called me the n-word, but I think he kicked me in the back and thank god he did [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3211.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because I was just like part of the sir. I was just completing the circuit [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3215.92s)]
*  I was just probably powering a fucking lantern or something down the street. Yeah [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3219.12s)]
*  Whatever I was doing dude. It was unhealthy for me. Yeah, you know because I was conducting electricity and um [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3224.16s)]
*  Thank god, but yeah, I just remember be it was very [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3230.32s)]
*  Very [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3235.52s)]
*  It seemed like um, there were some safety issues. I would say yeah, it sounds like it [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3236.96s)]
*  Yeah, we i've definitely run into a few live rides before yeah, especially dirt. Oh, it's that happened? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3241.68s)]
*  Yeah, what's happened to me? Okay. Yeah, so that's a real thing. Yep [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3246.24s)]
*  Because I know my whole life. I was like, I know this happened man [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3250.72s)]
*  Well, how does that happen? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3254.88s)]
*  Um, because there's so much wiring going on in those things like all the lights and everywhere [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3256.24s)]
*  And back then too, you know now with leds [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3261.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't take as much but back then you had those really hot lights and they took a lot more power [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3263.52s)]
*  And so you got bigger currents running through and something could just get cut or pinched somewhere along the line [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3267.44s)]
*  And next thing you know, you're making that live [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3273.12s)]
*  damn [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3275.6s)]
*  god [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3276.7200000000003s)]

*  But I remember that too we walk over and [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3295.04s)]
*  Yeah, the rides would just be getting set up in the distance and we'd come in and they'd [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3298.3199999999997s)]
*  They'd have somebody standing over there and for 50 cents [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3303.44s)]
*  You could get over there and get you a couple tickets and go get on them [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3306.56s)]
*  Yeah, and know the other kids people didn't know because the fair wasn't open [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3309.84s)]
*  Yeah, but we knew this could be live right there. And so we'd all walk over there. That's cool [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3313.52s)]
*  We I don't we never did anything like that. It was pretty cool, man [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3317.84s)]

*  Really? I didn't like that shit. I knew [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3360.24s)]
*  That you pretty much weren't gonna win no there's something that you are not gonna win unless they want you to win [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3365.04s)]
*  oh [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3370.56s)]
*  If you if they got if you if they got enough money out of you and they got a good tip going [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3372.08s)]
*  There's a big crowd if you're in a wheelchair or something probably if you're maybe it all depends on how much money you spent [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3375.6s)]
*  Yeah [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3382.0s)]
*  and then like if they got a nice crowd and they want to keep that and a lot of like if the crowd is really [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3382.64s)]
*  Like they've been there a while [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3387.12s)]
*  And they really want to see that dude win and he spent enough money and you know [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3389.52s)]
*  You could get now you can if that dude wins everybody's gonna stop playing. Yeah, you know, uh, so the part of it is some strategy [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3392.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's a lot of strategy to it [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3399.44s)]
*  What was one of the games that was the toughest game to win? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3401.12s)]
*  Probably you think the toughest to win like [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3403.68s)]
*  Legitimately [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3408.14s)]
*  Well, so there was some that just can't be won. Okay, so okay, so take me like what is one of them? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3409.6s)]
*  So like the cover the red spot you guys ever have that one cover the red spot [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3415.12s)]
*  So there would be yeah, there'd be a big red circle. Yeah, you get like a little disc. Yes. Yeah [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3420.24s)]
*  Could not be won legally. Oh [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3426.56s)]
*  There would be one [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3429.12s)]
*  That could be one on that the guy would show you how to do it on because that one can be one [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3430.8s)]
*  Okay, and he would always use that one and i've worked that game before so I know how it's done [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3435.04s)]
*  And then you have all the other ones the circles are just slightly too big to be completely covered [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3440.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, so the base circle. Yep. There it is. Ah cover the spot [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3446.5600000000004s)]

*  so sometimes those red circles are just [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3456.7200000000003s)]
*  Slightly too big where it's mathematically impossible to cover it all [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3460.06s)]

*  So the bushel basket that's what it is. The tubs of fun. So they take those remember those old apple bushel baskets [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3726.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, yes, I remember this and they'd be up on the side [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3731.2s)]
*  Yeah, like at an angle kind of yeah at an angle kind and you got to toss the softball in there [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3733.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3737.12s)]
*  There it is [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3739.44s)]
*  Oh, there's some guys getting it right here [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3740.8s)]
*  Yeah [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3743.44s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a there's a trick to it do you see how he's doing it you got to give it a spin and it's [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3748.16s)]
*  Got to hit right on the edge. I see so it'll like it'll [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3752.16s)]
*  Kind of like use its momentum to stay in there and they're using plastic ones, too [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3756.0s)]
*  They I don't know right go back to the bushel basket. Can you find the bushel basket? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3759.76s)]
*  They might be just as hard the one we're talking about [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3763.04s)]
*  It's the same game but the bush those were made of the wooden ones like the original apple bushel baskets [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3765.52s)]
*  Yeah, so take me through it. So what the problem with those they were at like an angle, right? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3770.4s)]
*  It's that same same same thing as that with the plastic ones except they were wooden [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3774.48s)]
*  They just won't stay in there the softball is so light and bouncy and the back of those baskets are just so bouncy as well [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3779.7599999999998s)]
*  That they would just bounce out. You can't get the ball to stay in there [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3786.8s)]
*  It's it's really I mean if you know a trick and like they were doing if you could get the right back spin on it [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3790.32s)]
*  And hit it right at the edge [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3796.7200000000003s)]
*  You can get it to stay in there [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3798.64s)]
*  But how they get people so easily is they'll the guy sitting in the in the booth [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3799.84s)]
*  Can easily toss the ball in there from his angle? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3805.36s)]
*  It'll easily go in there and stay in there and then you give the other ball to the guy and be like look at how easy [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3808.0s)]
*  It is throw the ball in there and give him a free. Here's a free shot [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3812.56s)]
*  See how easy it is and then they throw it in there because that other ball's already in the basket [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3815.6s)]
*  It'll dead in that second ball and that second ball will stay in [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3819.52s)]
*  So now people like oh my god, that was so easy [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3823.3599999999997s)]
*  But now when you give them the balls, they don't have that first ball in there and they won't get that ball to stay in there. Wow [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3826.56s)]
*  And you're like no it's like this this you know what you're doing wrong bud [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3833.44s)]
*  You're hitting it in the wrong place. Watch what I do. Watch what I do [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3837.04s)]
*  You take that ball and you're like just like this throw it in there and it goes in and you're like here's this ball [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3839.8399999999997s)]
*  Watch try it now and they do it and they're like, oh I did it you're right [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3844.56s)]
*  And then you give them both balls again, and then they can never do it again [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3848.4s)]
*  You just keep it going keep the cycle going [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3851.28s)]
*  Dude, I remember the weird there was always the weirdest energy when you were the kid and you were up there at the thing [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3853.44s)]
*  once you'd engaged in the conversation with the booth guy if you're a kid you're like [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3859.28s)]
*  You start to feel like man. I gotta play now. I already started talking to this guy [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3864.08s)]
*  You know, I only got a couple of bucks here. What am I gonna do? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3869.04s)]
*  You know, and then you would play and then you would fucking miss the first one and you'd be like I am such a fucking loser [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3873.2s)]
*  Yeah [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3879.52s)]
*  I am a loser and they know you're not going to win too [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3880.56s)]
*  And they're just trying to get that two bucks out of you and get you out of the get you out of their hair [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3883.52s)]
*  God that was hard and i'll tell you what if eric adams was there [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3888.72s)]
*  He would have found out that there wasn't an xbox in that box. Yeah [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3892.72s)]
*  Yeah [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3895.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, so you're saying that if they have the prizes some of the prizes aren't even in the box [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3898.72s)]
*  No, wow. Oh, yeah, because they know nobody can win it. So why you're not even gonna put a real prize [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3902.56s)]
*  They just put playstation boxes the next boxes. I mean [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3906.72s)]
*  damn [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3909.7599999999998s)]
*  Dude in the craze eric adams will probably find the yoyo that time in there [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3910.88s)]
*  What's in here and mitch is talking about the episode with um, who we wish shane gillis and we're like that [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3917.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's just that was so funny, dude [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3922.96s)]
*  Yeah, that was a crazy video. I can't believe they're doing the drug searches like that [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3925.68s)]
*  but yeah, oh, but sometimes we would win something and it would be a [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3929.2s)]
*  Felt elvis or a felt picture of a something. Oh, I remember those felt pictures [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3933.84s)]
*  Remember it was like it was like neon and felt. Yeah, some of it would be felt like not all of it [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3939.28s)]
*  You get a black light or something. It would look like you'd be able to see it. Oh and the posters they had those felt posters [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3943.7599999999998s)]
*  That's what it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3949.04s)]
*  um [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3951.12s)]
*  Yeah, I forgot about those. Yeah the start our games like the the ones that you throw the dart at [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3951.92s)]
*  Oh, that was fun with the balloons. Yeah, the balloons are a hustle though, too [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3957.36s)]
*  It is oh, yeah, because they don't always have like because oh because you'd have a dot behind it or something. You had to have a um [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3960.48s)]
*  They'd have different um circles under there and they'd say small medium large like what size prize you win [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3967.04s)]
*  And you know, they would never have an extra large up under there [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3972.0s)]
*  Or if they did it would be under like a really like barely blown up balloon [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3975.04s)]
*  So that die would always bounce wouldn't god [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3978.2400000000002s)]
*  Because I based how I felt about myself for the rest of the year on how well I did on these games [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3982.8s)]
*  That was the that was the thing [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3988.8s)]
*  Yeah [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3990.6400000000003s)]
*  Even the star dart game like if you didn't get that dart right in the red star dart [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3991.52s)]
*  Yeah [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3995.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what we called it the star dart where it was like you had to throw a dart get it in the red [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3996.0s)]
*  And it couldn't touch the border around it [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=3999.76s)]
*  It would be a black border around the red star and if it touched any part of the the dart was touching the black [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4001.6800000000003s)]
*  Just a little bit you didn't win [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4007.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4008.56s)]
*  And the thing was if you think it would be in there completely, you know [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4009.36s)]
*  You're on the ground you hit it and you're like, oh did that go in? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4012.24s)]
*  And the person working the game would go up and look and if it was all the way in but it was close [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4014.64s)]
*  He would just touch it a little bit and push the dart so it would touch the black. No. Oh, yeah [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4018.64s)]
*  Yeah, you just have to do it nice and smooth [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4025.2799999999997s)]
*  So you just you know, you just barely push the dart up a little bit [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4027.12s)]
*  So it'll start touching the border and be like, oh you're so close bud. Come on up and take a look [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4029.84s)]
*  You'll see it's touching the black. I don't even remember that one star dart [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4034.32s)]
*  I remember they had the water horse, but that was a competition against other people. So somebody always won [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4038.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there are ones that are slower than others [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4043.36s)]
*  Yeah, naturally like the games like you could hit them both at the same time [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4045.7599999999998s)]
*  And one just rises a lot slower than the other one or blows up the other one [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4049.44s)]
*  I remember yeah one sometimes it didn't even make any sense [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4053.2799999999997s)]
*  I remember one time it was like ring the fucking fish and they had [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4055.44s)]
*  Fish swimming and you just throw the fucking rings in there [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4058.56s)]
*  Get a fish you can get shit. You're like [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4061.8399999999997s)]

*  Just seeing your fucking reality each year when I went it was like god seeing the allowance [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4073.52s)]
*  How much yeah, I based my like who I was off of that man. It just like because I would save my money each [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4079.36s)]
*  You know, I was very particular about saving my money. So [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4086.32s)]
*  When we go down there I'd have an you know [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4089.92s)]

*  I will say this because you know why because you got a bunch of rings [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4112.72s)]
*  Yeah, and they can't lie to you you're either getting it on the bottle or you're not like that's a legitimate game [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4115.28s)]
*  That those are still around right? That was a lot of fun. I remember [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4119.44s)]
*  Um, those ones are a hustle. Oh, yeah the weighted. Yeah, they're weighted everybody knows that now [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4123.2s)]

*  And the softballs. Yeah, what was so hard about it? Just they're weighted. They're not going to knock over with the um softball [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4132.48s)]
*  Because you'd fill them with you'd fill them with lead or cement or whatever and the top one would be empty [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4139.28s)]
*  So people said oh they're weighted you would just grab the empty one and hand it to him and be like, oh look at dude [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4144.08s)]
*  They're not weighted. Oh [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4148.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4151.2s)]

*  So some of them were so confusing to me. I didn't play them. You would just push that basket in [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4174.08s)]
*  So it would never do it. So it would never do it. So it never drop in [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4179.679999999999s)]

*  You know they had a whole grip of you know games or a whole bunch of food stands [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4655.139999999999s)]

*  Ah, I see so there was a lot of that [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4674.9s)]

*  They start buying up other carnival [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4681.14s)]
*  businesses then they start buying their own games and food and hiring people to run them for them instead of like [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=4683.4400000000005s)]

*  It was um, it was interesting I'll tell you about another crazy game that we had was uh, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5334.5s)]
*  It was called the crazy bike. We ever heard of that one crazy bike. Yeah, it was a bicycle [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5338.660000000001s)]
*  Where if you turn left the wheel went right and if you turn the handlebars right the wheel went left [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5343.14s)]
*  Oh my gosh. No. Yeah, and so I owned one of those [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5347.780000000001s)]
*  And I couldn't ride it. I couldn't but I forgot my one of my best friends learned how to ride it [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5352.34s)]
*  So we put it out there and if you could ride it 10 feet, we would give you 50 bucks [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5356.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that thing was a hustle it was it was pretty tough to run I mean [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5361.46s)]
*  But if you could learn how to ride it [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5364.34s)]
*  And the kid that worked for me was really good [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5366.34s)]
*  He'd be able to sit on the handlebars backwards and ride it like he got really good at it [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5368.26s)]
*  Is it unicycle? No, it was a bicycle regular bicycle two-wheeled bike a crazy bike and we called it a crazy bike [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5372.9s)]
*  And so the if you turn it to the left the wheel went to the right [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5378.26s)]
*  Yep [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5381.14s)]
*  If you turn to the right the wheel went left so hard to try to figure out how to ride that really [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5381.86s)]
*  Especially if you never had oh, yeah, see I couldn't even imagine this man [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5385.78s)]
*  It's like because your instincts like see, yeah. Yeah [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5389.94s)]
*  It's like dyslexia made of piece of transportation, but he could yeah [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5393.46s)]
*  He my friend could ride it all around the carnival like that. Wow [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5396.74s)]
*  Oh, that's a vibe. Yeah [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5402.82s)]
*  And so we would do it if you drove it 10 feet [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5404.82s)]
*  We would mark it on the ground if you drove it 10 feet [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5406.98s)]
*  We'd give you 50 bucks and now was there a lot of ladies to me. Did you guys call regular people civilians? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5409.14s)]
*  What did y'all call them marks marks? Yeah god [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5414.58s)]
*  And everybody that walked through it was like we how much can we got to we got to get it out of it [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5418.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we got to get it get that mark [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5421.94s)]
*  And if you got one you'd call it out like, you know, we got you got a fresh one [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5423.3s)]
*  You got a mark here and a lot of people would wear these pins called. I love robin marks [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5426.58s)]
*  But it would be spelled out like robin [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5430.82s)]
*  Robin and then marks underneath it. So it looked like somebody's name. Who was robin marks? I was [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5433.06s)]
*  I was robin marks. I got it [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5439.78s)]
*  But nobody was really actually robin marks. I know bring up a picture for robin marks. Let's just find some [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5442.18s)]
*  There's got to be somebody [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5447.3s)]
*  There we go robin marks. Oh, wow. There is one [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5449.46s)]
*  And so yeah, if you get marks, there she is right there. Oh, sweetie [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5452.58s)]
*  I could fall in love with her husband. Yeah, and like for the games you would either you'd either be an agent or a clerk [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5456.900000000001s)]
*  That's what we call the people that work the games like they're joinies [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5463.9400000000005s)]
*  But an agent is somebody that can rob a mark and a clerk is somebody that's just going to collect his money and not really [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5466.34s)]
*  Hustle them [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5471.780000000001s)]
*  So like what give me an example of how those would be at the game [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5472.74s)]
*  Like a clerk is somebody that doesn't really doesn't really know how to hustle somebody [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5475.62s)]
*  Okay, you know what I mean? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5478.9s)]
*  He would just be there like oh you want to play he'll collect your money and you can play the game [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5480.0199999999995s)]
*  But he's not going to sit there and try to hustle you out of all money [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5483.94s)]
*  Okay, where an agent is going to try to take you for everything you got [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5486.58s)]
*  And who were the ages were there was it like usually older people was it young could it be anybody? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5490.34s)]
*  It was anybody anybody that was good at hustling really like it was all all ages whites. Was it native america? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5495.78s)]
*  Like who type was it any it was whites whites. Yeah [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5501.3s)]
*  It's kind of a white sport carnivaling. Yeah [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5505.78s)]
*  Yeah, has it has it changed like or I remember it being like that [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5509.3s)]
*  It was like kind of maybe white and black guys at work or white and black people that work there [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5512.66s)]
*  I guess yeah, that's all we had in our area. Yeah up up there and up north [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5516.74s)]
*  We didn't really have there's not a lot of blacks up north. Yeah, I mean one of my best friends artist [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5521.38s)]
*  He was an older guy and he worked out there my whole life [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5526.18s)]
*  He was best friends with my brother because all my siblings were much older than me [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5528.34s)]
*  And so yeah, we had some out there and some you know some uh, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5532.5s)]
*  I guess it's some puerto rican's and stuff like but not really. I mean now [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5536.58s)]
*  They have a lot of um mexicans and south africans [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5540.74s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah, that's pretty much who's running the rides now. Why what's changed like how have things changed? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5544.18s)]
*  Yeah, since the past to now well [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5549.62s)]
*  It was hard finding I think really good ride help [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5552.900000000001s)]
*  So they I don't know why it was mexico and south south africa. I don't know why those two countries were picked [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5556.900000000001s)]
*  But apparently it sold to them that you're going to go on a work and vacation [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5563.46s)]
*  You get to see the united states and work and make money while you're at it, which is all bullshit [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5566.740000000001s)]
*  You're just you're doing the carnival and you're at that carnival. It doesn't look any different wherever you go [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5571.540000000001s)]
*  You just it's the same lot. So you're not you're not seeing anything different [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5577.38s)]

*  I would go stay at his house. I guess I remember [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5613.86s)]
*  But yeah, what it was I didn't see him that much until I was had to be at the carnival to see him. Yeah [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5616.82s)]

*  Whatever people yeah start to lose their steam. Yeah their edge [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5636.66s)]
*  But so it was definitely different and my mom, you know trying to hold the carnival together [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5640.82s)]
*  Herself when all the kids were already grown and out of the house and not helping anymore [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5646.0s)]

*  everything went off smooth, especially if you're doing food or like [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5765.7s)]
*  Games that aren't a ripoff of rides like you know [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5769.14s)]
*  A lot of the ride guys would feel pride in having like a really nice ride with all the lights working and stuff like that [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5771.54s)]
*  Making sure every bulb is fixed because then you got some rides where the ride suit the ride guys didn't really give a fucking like [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5776.26s)]
*  All the lights are busted. They got one blanket light going and like yeah, that's it [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5781.860000000001s)]

*  So he's done [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5793.22s)]
*  He doesn't really care about the ride that much [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5794.58s)]
*  but when but for the families that are out there and like [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5796.820000000001s)]
*  When you have a good weekend or like a really nice fair and you feel good about like [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5800.74s)]

*  You know, you've been like a family's running like if a family owned like we do the games or we do the right like [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5812.74s)]
*  We do the food and we do the right games. So there would be some organization of that [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5817.86s)]
*  Yeah, there would be multiple families. There would be like, you know, sometimes 10 12 different families out there [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5821.78s)]
*  Yeah [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5827.38s)]
*  All owning I mean sometimes you would have one guy that just owned his one game and he would travel everywhere with you with you [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5827.86s)]
*  Just running his one game and that's what he owned [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5834.58s)]
*  Was there another world of carning where it was like somebody owned all of it and they would just hire all the people [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5838.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's becoming that now. Oh it is. Yeah [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5844.58s)]

*  We need more escapism these days [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5861.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun. I definitely remember it was fun [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5863.86s)]
*  Yeah [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5866.74s)]
*  And that was the thing like it was crazy and stuff and we have some crazy stories [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5866.9s)]
*  But we always wanted to make sure like we had we wanted to provide a good time for the people too [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5869.94s)]
*  I mean granted the rides definitely, you know, are I mean the games are a hustle [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5874.58s)]
*  And some agents did take it too far, you know [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5878.9s)]
*  I agree like those people that were getting robbed of their life savings like you're taking it too far. Yeah, but um [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5881.38s)]
*  For the most part like you do want the people to have a good time and come back the next day and bring more people [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5887.0599999999995s)]

*  That's a good place to get rid of them. Yeah, I think that was like some of the vibe [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5949.94s)]
*  It was just like people that had extra animals or whatever and they're like we're gonna bring them up here because we knew people be up here [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=5953.3s)]

*  They were gypsies. So they were travelers. They were travelers like because normally like if you wanted to do the big fairs [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6104.820000000001s)]
*  You would have to like as a like if you were a gypsy that just wanted to come in and do it [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6111.3s)]
*  Like an us family or different families that were out there [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6114.900000000001s)]
*  They would make you do the spring season with them and you had to do all the shit spots if you wanted to get the good spots [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6117.3s)]

*  You got away with it. They would do what they wouldn't have to do the shit spots [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6130.02s)]
*  Sometimes you would just see a gypsy like a psychic reader or somebody that did like the palm reading or something like that [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6133.3s)]
*  Or the cards and you would only see them at like some of the some of the big fairs [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6138.5s)]
*  And they wouldn't have to do like all the shit spots. Oh, they didn't have to play the smaller ones in this [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6142.5s)]
*  And the ones you didn't love. Yeah, they were funny man [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6146.339999999999s)]

*  Meziz [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6284.74s)]
*  Bussin' that out man. That's a [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6286.8s)]
*  So how do you shut the carnival down and move it to the next place? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6289.62s)]
*  What's that like what's the breakdown like in the setup? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6292.74s)]
*  When you close at night you wait for the big gondola wheel to close down [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6295.780000000001s)]
*  That's how you know you're closed. What is the big gondola wheel? The big ferris wheel [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6298.58s)]
*  The giant ferris wheel you wait for the lights to go off and that means you close [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6301.860000000001s)]
*  that's when you know it's time to close and you close down and uh [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6304.58s)]
*  Depending on what you ran [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6308.42s)]
*  Um games were really easy to tear down [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6310.5s)]
*  You know the hardest thing was putting on the hitch after they took your game away because the hitches come off the [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6313.46s)]
*  They pull the trailer that you pull the trailer by [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6318.5s)]
*  You got to take those off so you can put all the games bottom up to each other [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6320.740000000001s)]
*  Make the midway wait hold on when you say make the midway [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6324.26s)]
*  What do you mean and you put them one into the truck? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6326.5s)]
*  When you put you know when you go on to the midway the midway is like [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6328.74s)]
*  Where all the games and the food are they're all able to butt up against each other flat because you take the hitch off [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6331.94s)]
*  With that that goes on to the that you hook the truck up to you back the truck up to the hitch [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6336.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and so that comes off and that's probably the hardest part of like tearing down a game [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6340.9s)]
*  Okay, it's taking that on and on and how do you all travel it all out? How does it all move out? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6345.54s)]
*  So it's up to each family [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6349.94s)]
*  They usually have trucks that pull that pull their stuff and somebody that works for them [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6351.7s)]
*  Usually it'll be a driver or two. They might have a couple drivers [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6356.34s)]
*  Or you might hire a trucking company to come in and pull your stuff [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6359.86s)]
*  um the the carnival that [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6363.0599999999995s)]
*  Like the carnival itself [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6365.38s)]
*  They own big trucks that pull their stuff and they also hire people out too depending on how fast you got to get the stuff [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6366.58s)]
*  Over the road how far it is if you can make multiple trips or not because sometimes if you're only going [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6372.179999999999s)]
*  You know 50 60 miles you can make multiple trips [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6377.46s)]
*  But if you're going a couple hundred miles, you might not want to make as many trips, you know [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6379.94s)]
*  You don't have the time. Yeah, so you'll hire a trucking company to come in and take it [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6383.62s)]
*  And I used to tear down rides and stuff too for extra money [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6387.78s)]
*  So I would do like sometimes up to five rides a night. I'd tear down and set up [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6390.66s)]
*  I would tear down five rides go set up five rides [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6395.0599999999995s)]
*  And you know, you make good extra money doing that. Yeah, it was cash [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6398.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so what do they pay an extra 50 bucks to help turn around or something? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6401.379999999999s)]
*  Wow [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6404.259999999999s)]
*  So you do four or five a night maybe a couple hundred bucks. That's great [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6405.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6409.3s)]
*  Yeah [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6409.9400000000005s)]
*  And so like the stand I have now [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6411.3s)]
*  Like some of the even back then at the carnival we had a wooden frame like I ran towards the end [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6413.3s)]
*  I ran all I was in charge of the food stands for my brother and my father [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6417.78s)]
*  and um [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6422.66s)]
*  We had the wood frame sausage stands that had the counters that came along the side that you could sit at [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6424.26s)]
*  And sit at the counters and like watch them cook and stuff like that. I don't know if you had them down here or not, but [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6429.46s)]
*  That so that's what I have now. That's what I use out at the festivals, too [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6434.58s)]
*  Okay, and that's a lot of work because everything has to come out of the truck [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6438.0199999999995s)]
*  You know the grills the fry laters the fridges like everything comes out. You said how would they move the big rides? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6441.38s)]
*  How do they get those to the next town or whatever? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6446.74s)]
*  Yeah, big big truck you tear down and most of them they fold down pretty small like a lot of them [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6449.46s)]
*  They fold onto a semi or just onto a trailer on a semi trailer on a trailer. Yeah, it's got wheels under it [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6455.219999999999s)]
*  Some of them are ground we call the other ones that aren't on a trailer ground mounts [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6461.54s)]
*  Okay, so they'll have a trailer for it and but everything has to come off the trailer and set up on the ground [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6464.98s)]
*  okay, but then some are on the trailer itself and the trailer just unfolds like a [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6469.94s)]
*  You know like a transformer how hard is it to break down a whole carnival? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6475.0599999999995s)]
*  Does it take a whole day or they get it done in a matter of it depends? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6478.26s)]
*  I mean you could move you can get it done fairly fast, you know, sometimes [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6481.46s)]
*  you can be have [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6485.46s)]
*  Everything done in like a good six hours or so [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6487.54s)]
*  Wow, really? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6490.98s)]
*  Do they travel at night usually or what does it happen? Yeah, yeah, because usually closed sunday nights [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6492.98s)]
*  And so you're done depending on how late you close sometimes they'll close early [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6498.0199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6502.66s)]
*  Some sundays though, they do the uh the bracelets where you buy a bracelet [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6504.099999999999s)]
*  You could ride all the rides all day and night [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6507.459999999999s)]
*  And so when they do that and if you're making money stay open later because you don't want to you don't want to close [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6509.54s)]
*  On people is what we call it. Oh, yeah, there's people still there. Yeah [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6513.7s)]
*  When it was one other game we used to play where you would like put the slide the money and it would [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6517.54s)]
*  You pay and get these thing of coins and you put the coins in [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6522.0199999999995s)]
*  And it would push the splash down was one of the ones we called it [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6525.3s)]
*  Yeah, it would move the coins forward and sometimes it would push a little like a [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6528.26s)]
*  An actual quarter would be on top of it would push a quarter off for a dollar. We use quarters in ours [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6531.94s)]
*  Oh you do. Yeah, there was sometimes [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6536.66s)]
*  Depending on the state sometimes you had to use coins. Sometimes you can use quarters in Maine. You can use quarters [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6539.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and so but those are a hustle too are they yeah because [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6544.099999999999s)]
*  There's a couple different ways they hustled it. Sometimes there would be uh something [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6548.099999999999s)]
*  Under the quarters of the coins. There's like this triangle right at the front of the lip [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6552.58s)]
*  So when they're pushing they push sideways and if you want to see on the sides, there's the splashdowns on the sides [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6556.74s)]
*  Did you notice before that there's an out of bounds so the coins can push into the out of bounds? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6562.099999999999s)]
*  So you would put a lot of weight in the middle [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6568.179999999999s)]
*  so [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6571.54s)]
*  Instead of pushing forward it would push to the side. Yeah, because they could fall off to the side [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6572.58s)]
*  Yeah, and if they fell off in the middle, you got it. You got it, right? [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6576.58s)]
*  But if they fall to the sides the house gets it. Yeah, that was it right there [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6579.22s)]
*  And so the more weight you put in the front [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6582.82s)]
*  The more it's going to push to the sides [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6585.54s)]
*  Sometimes people would glue that shit down. No. Oh, yeah [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6589.62s)]
*  God [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6594.5s)]
*  You know what it taught you though? It taught you about loss, man [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6595.7s)]
*  It taught you that life is gonna fucking you're probably gonna lose [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6599.46s)]
*  Yeah, you know and you're probably gonna knock somebody up [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6603.94s)]
*  Yeah, it just taught me that everything is a fucking hustle man everything in life [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6607.86s)]
*  Whether it's your hvac guy [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6612.82s)]
*  Whether it's your teacher at high school [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBVyexwTnXI&t=6614.9s)]
