*  Today's guest is one of the funniest people I think that's ever lived. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=38.0s)]
*  And it's a wild thing to say because I'm only just known of this period of time, but I'd go on to throw him on in there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=46.0s)]
*  Probably in the top 400. He is on his American royalty tour right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=53.0s)]
*  He has his own show, The Tim Dillon Show. It's a podcast. You can find it every week. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=59.0s)]
*  I'm just so grateful to get to yap it up with this guy. Man, he makes me laugh. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Today's guest is my friend, Mr. Tim Dillon. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=71.0s)]
*  I don't know. Sometimes I like it. I just started doing it because like... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=102.0s)]
*  Can we see Tim's shot just so we have his idea of it so we can see it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=108.0s)]
*  If you can de-read my face somehow, that would be amazing. I know that these things are hard to do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Did you get a procedure done or something? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=118.0s)]
*  No, no. I just have like a breakout today. Some days you just wake up and you have like a breakout. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=120.0s)]
*  But if you have any of the technology that James Cameron used in Avatar... [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=127.0s)]
*  To de-read your face a little? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=131.0s)]
*  To just de-read my nose. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll take something off of you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=134.0s)]
*  Any of the plastic surgery? There's got to be some like AI. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=136.0s)]
*  We just got scalpel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=143.0s)]
*  Good. I think that technology should get to a point where like literally when someone sees you they should go, who are you? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=146.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, man. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=159.0s)]
*  The fact that we have to show up as ourselves... [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=160.0s)]
*  It's insane. And that's why the... Yeah, that's what the metaverse is going to slap, as the kids would say. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=165.0s)]
*  The simple fact that a one-legged person has to actually present themselves... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=173.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=181.0s)]
*  They should just... Yeah, because you know online they have two legs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=182.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, how humiliating do you want this existence to be? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=185.0s)]
*  Now I see why people are like Jacob Elordi 2006 on their handle. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=193.0s)]
*  But they won't come to the door to get their door dash. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=197.0s)]
*  No, because God only knows. I'll tell you this, man. Those door dash people see some shit. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=201.0s)]
*  Oh, God, dude. First of all, lest we forget, the people that have had to go to people's homes, brother, they have to go into the trenches of... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Well, sometimes they get killed. Sometimes people kill them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=222.0s)]
*  Sometimes you have a burrito in your car and you're driving it to someone's house. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=227.0s)]
*  And that is going to be the last thing you do on this earth. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=233.0s)]
*  The last thing you do is walk a soggy burrito to a guy's house. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=237.0s)]
*  And instead of just taking the burrito and saying thank you, he goes, I'm going to kill you now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=242.0s)]
*  And then they kill you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=247.0s)]
*  They say, welcome to Memphis. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=249.0s)]
*  Yeah, welcome to Memphis. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=251.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing is a lot of the people inside who know they're going to kill you, as you're walking up, murders have gotten so advanced with ambiance and production that they will even play, there goes my hero. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=253.0s)]
*  From like a yard plant, speakers hidden in yard plants. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=268.0s)]
*  As you're about to go. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=273.0s)]
*  Watch him as he goes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=275.0s)]
*  And you're laying there and you're bleeding out. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=277.0s)]
*  And one of the last thoughts you have is this song is great. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=280.0s)]
*  This is a great song. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=284.0s)]
*  And I'm sad I won't be able to hear it anymore. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=286.0s)]
*  It's the last thing I'm hearing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=288.0s)]
*  And then you see that burrito as you're bleeding out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=289.0s)]
*  You just look at it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=291.0s)]
*  Just that burrito. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=292.0s)]
*  It's a tough gig. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=294.0s)]
*  A hand just comes in a frame and grabs it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=297.0s)]
*  It's a tough gig. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=298.0s)]
*  The gig economy is tough. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=300.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I've talked about this before. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=302.0s)]
*  They want us to all just be gig people who are doing gigs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=304.0s)]
*  Oh, they want us to be. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=310.0s)]
*  It will eventually be the lords. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=311.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=314.0s)]
*  And then everybody else will just be driving around like literally holding will all be Uber drivers. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=315.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=320.0s)]
*  And we'll be holding each other at gunpoint to be passengers like be my passenger now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=321.0s)]
*  Well, sit in the backseat, subscribe to my daughter's only fans while you're back there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=327.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=332.0s)]
*  And then you'll be in the front seat with a light on her. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=335.0s)]
*  No, it's going to get to a point where there's going to be, I think, communities where no one leaves like really wealthy communities. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=336.0s)]
*  And then people are just going to get so rich. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=345.0s)]
*  These houses are getting so big. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=347.0s)]
*  Everything they want is going to be in their house. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=349.0s)]
*  They're going to have the whole foods in the house. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=351.0s)]
*  It'll be a tinier whole foods, but it'll be in their house. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=353.0s)]
*  They go, I just have a grocery store in my home. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=355.0s)]
*  I have everything I need in my home. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=357.0s)]
*  We have a little doctor's office. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=359.0s)]
*  They're going to get to a point where you go to the doctor and they just take an elevator down in their house. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=360.0s)]
*  To an urgent care. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=364.0s)]
*  There's an urgent care. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=365.0s)]
*  There's a nurse sitting there and the nurse is going to hand you the paperwork and you go, bitch, you're in my house. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=366.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=370.0s)]
*  And then she's going to go, yeah, but it's like still one of those things we have to fill out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=371.0s)]
*  And you go, all right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=375.0s)]
*  So you're filling out paperwork in your own house to get your ball looked at. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=376.0s)]
*  And that's how rich that's the level of rich where you're never going to have to leave. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=381.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=385.0s)]
*  Never going to have to leave. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=386.0s)]
*  And why should you have to leave? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=387.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=388.0s)]
*  I think then every now and then you gamble online by ordering door dash just to see someone come up from the depths, from the lower, from somebody climb out of a wishing well. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=389.0s)]
*  Occasionally you'll go to an airport. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=400.0s)]
*  That'll be the thing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=402.0s)]
*  Occasionally you'll go to an airport and you'll go, God, cheat. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=403.0s)]
*  And you're going to see these people around you and they'll have their pillows around their neck and they're drinking smoothies and stuff. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=406.0s)]
*  And some of them are asleep on the floor. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=413.0s)]
*  And you're going to go, oh, yeah, that's what life is for most of these people that don't have a doctor's office in their house. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=415.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=421.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's definitely getting alarming, man. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=422.0s)]
*  People are sleeping that a family they found said was sleeping in a wishing well. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=424.0s)]
*  They had basically comment here's a wishing well somewhere. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=429.0s)]
*  Yeah. And a guy had built a bedroom with shovels, right, had two bedrooms out a wishing well and it was raising his children in it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=435.0s)]
*  Well, it's like it's like all the Disney stories that we grew up with are now very disturbing, you know, like this idea of like when you look back at all these stories, things like that, like living in a well, living in a wishing well. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=443.0s)]
*  If you had read that story when you were like 10, you'd be like, that's the shit. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=457.0s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=461.0s)]
*  Like that's a beautiful moment that that family gets to live in that well and wish every day. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=466.0s)]
*  And then you realize now it's just a place people throw cigarettes at. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=467.0s)]
*  It's a real horrible place. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=470.0s)]
*  You know, you're just getting cigarettes and recyclables. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=472.0s)]
*  Old furniture. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=476.0s)]
*  Just a homeless guy yells into it every night when you're trying to sleep. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=478.0s)]
*  Just undecipherable yelling for 20 minutes. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=481.0s)]
*  People just throw used clothing, just throw old Lacoste shirts down there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=484.0s)]

*  They're in a truck. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=538.0s)]
*  I see somebody just wandering like sometimes they have their friend with them as a lookout. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=539.0s)]

*  Well, we make them the saddest part is we make them drive to it's like, well, yeah, they're a victim to gas prices, at least in other countries. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=630.0s)]
*  They like door dashers will be on motorcycles or they'll just be throwing the food to someone who's further down the street. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=638.0s)]
*  Actually cool. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=644.0s)]

*  Like I can afford. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=868.0s)]
*  Then you'd end up having to pay for him. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=869.0s)]
*  A lot of times it was this guy was just like tickets at carnival, like tickets to the comedy [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=871.0s)]
*  show because he was also a feature opener. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=875.0s)]

*  But one time he had two milkshakes. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=884.0s)]
*  Right. And a couple of he had a couple of sisters that were fighting each other near a [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=886.0s)]
*  Honda Civic. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=892.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=893.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=894.0s)]
*  Which is that's most of the Midwest. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=895.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=897.0s)]

*  The whole state of Missouri, the Civic with two sisters, maybe hefty. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=900.0s)]

*  Right. So he's like, I'm going to be a good Samaritan. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=918.0s)]
*  I'm going to walk over there with two milkshakes. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=920.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=922.0s)]
*  Because I think in some cultures, if you milkshake a sister, it's like it's just like beautiful. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=923.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=930.0s)]

*  And they literally started beating them up. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=935.0s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=938.0s)]
*  They lit him up for just coming with milkshakes. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=940.0s)]
*  And he was such a he'd never let go of the shakes. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=943.0s)]
*  Right. So this guy took all the beatings down on his knees and he still has the shakes in [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=946.0s)]
*  like Christ on the cross with a shake on each. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=951.0s)]

*  He was. Yeah. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=960.0s)]
*  He'd invite you go to a show in the middle of Lake of the Ozark. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=962.0s)]

*  There'd be an arm. Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  Just an arm. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1012.0s)]

*  And he'd put it back on. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1019.0s)]
*  It was a dark time in the beginning of comedy, you know, and then he would tell people he like you go, I'm a veteran. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1021.0s)]
*  He didn't lose his arm in any type of veteran activity. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1028.0s)]
*  Yeah. But he would say I'm a veteran and they would be like, oh, thank you for your service. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1032.0s)]

*  No. Yeah. But he had like a fake arm. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1039.0s)]
*  And then he would get on airplanes and he'd go, I should sit in first class and be a veteran. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  And then the woman would go, yeah, but that's not how it works. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1046.0s)]
*  We're sorry you have an economy ticket. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1049.0s)]

*  They'd look at her. They'd be like, you're disgusting. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  But he was just an ex crackhead who lost his arm because he was on crack and gotten like a horrible accident in his car. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1064.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's they never there's not enough differential these days amongst the PTSD community. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1072.0s)]

*  It's like the Incans did not come up with ayahuasca so you could try to figure out how to get a Range Rover. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  There's no way that that was the intended purpose of ayahuasca. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1108.0s)]
*  It's a religious they used to give it to kids before they sacrificed them and killed them. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1113.0s)]

*  And then they're like, hey, did that help with your PTSD? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1173.0s)]
*  They're like, what war were you in? You go, no, I wasn't in any war. I just, you know, I had a stressful career as a gymnast. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1177.0s)]
*  I never made it to the Olympic trials. But like my parents were real hard on me as a gymnast. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1185.0s)]
*  So I got to come in here and get high once a week. Yeah, we were forced to wear tight turtlenecks at our private school. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1191.0s)]
*  It was real tough. You know, I sprained the hamstring once. My family was like, all right, well, your life's over. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1197.0s)]

*  Oh, from Full House? Full House. You're just running through that park. There's no heroin addicts, nothing. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1263.0s)]
*  It's just you and your dog running through the park. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1270.0s)]

*  PrizePix is the one that I enjoy. Instead of choosing teams, you choose individual players. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1300.0s)]
*  That's right. They have a unique way of doing things, which is the way I always prefer. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1307.0s)]
*  Each player has a set projection and you choose either more or less than that set projection. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1312.0s)]
*  For example, if you think Zion Williamson is going to have more than 17 points, you would pick that. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1320.0s)]
*  And if you think that Luka Donchik is going to have less than 24 points, you would pick that. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1328.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1439.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  This was, that was. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1441.0s)]
*  No, here's the thing. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  I don't want anyone to die or anyone to be hurt. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1443.0s)]
*  This wouldn't be your space. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1445.0s)]
*  And I don't want anyone to lose their property. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1446.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  But I just like a nice. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1449.0s)]
*  Crisp. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  I like a controlled burn. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1451.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  I like a controlled burn. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1453.0s)]
*  I think you go in there, you do a controlled burn. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1454.0s)]
*  Everybody goes to the hilltop, kind of watch it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1457.0s)]
*  And then. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  And you go down and rebuild together. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1461.0s)]
*  And then you go down and rebuild. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  You need to do that to thin out the forest. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1464.0s)]
*  Otherwise if they get overgrown, this is what happens. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1470.0s)]
*  I wanted to go scatter my mother's ashes in Hawaii. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1471.0s)]
*  Because she died and she loved Hawaii. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1474.0s)]
*  Did she really? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1477.0s)]
*  But it was a week after that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  I thought it would be in poor taste to come in with the urn. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1479.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1484.0s)]
*  You can't bring sand to the beach. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  I just don't want to. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1486.0s)]
*  And I come in with the urn and I'm just with ashes. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1487.0s)]
*  Just kind of, just kind of flinging them at people. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1489.0s)]
*  Or the urn, just some black people call it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1492.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1494.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1496.0s)]
*  That's not what it is. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1497.0s)]
*  I didn't want to do it. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1498.0s)]
*  But I, my mother did love Hawaii. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1499.0s)]
*  But I was like, you know what? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1500.0s)]
*  She won't know the difference if I go down to Florida. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1501.0s)]
*  Just kind of. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1504.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1506.0s)]
*  She's like, ocean's the ocean. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  Well she won't know the difference if you get one of those little Japanese sand gardens. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1508.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1512.0s)]
*  And just dump her in the middle. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1513.0s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1514.0s)]
*  I'm actually just going to throw an East River in New York. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1515.0s)]
*  Water's water. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1518.0s)]
*  Water eventually finds other water. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1519.0s)]
*  I think that East River will eventually find Hawaii. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1520.0s)]
*  I think that's the way water works. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1523.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1525.0s)]
*  Look, just throw her in the Hudson. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr. will clean it up. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1529.0s)]
*  He'll figure it out. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1531.0s)]
*  Him and his wife will figure it out. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1533.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  They're a fun couple. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  I just went to his 70th birthday. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1537.0s)]
*  They are amazing. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1539.0s)]
*  She's amazing. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  Two nights a go. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1541.0s)]
*  She's so funny. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1542.0s)]
*  The best thing about being around them is when she's around too, there's this whole level [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  of comedy that's around it all. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1547.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1549.0s)]
*  It's a fun sitcom where she's like a fun, bubbly, sunny person and the CIA killed his [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  whole family. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1558.0s)]
*  And it's just like a fun, and it's like hilarity ensues. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1559.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1563.0s)]
*  She's like looking for bombs in a car and she's playing tennis. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1564.0s)]
*  It's a fun mix. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  They're an odd couple. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1569.0s)]
*  Come and knock on our door. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1570.0s)]
*  Come and knock on our door. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1571.0s)]
*  This could be our last day. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1573.0s)]
*  Because they've killed all of his dad, his uncle. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1575.0s)]
*  And people are like, why is this guy so skeptical about stuff? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1579.0s)]
*  Are you out of your mind? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1582.0s)]
*  No, it's crazy. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  People are like, why doesn't he trust the government to inject us with the right chemicals? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1586.0s)]
*  It's like they killed. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1590.0s)]
*  He probably got so non-eventful that they would just open his door when he was a kid [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1592.0s)]
*  and go, they just killed someone else. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  And he'd go, whatever. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1598.0s)]
*  Did he even get upset? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1599.0s)]
*  After the third or the fourth one, it was probably like, yeah, we get it. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1601.0s)]
*  Yeah, after that, you've got to be able to just bet on who is going to happen on prize [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1604.0s)]
*  days or something. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they would just come to him and be like, hey, so your nephew just flew into [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1609.0s)]
*  a mountain, we think. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1611.0s)]
*  We don't even know. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  We think your cousin was eaten by a shark. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1614.0s)]
*  But while she was skiing, it didn't even make sense. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1616.0s)]
*  They're like, she was eaten by a shark on the slopes and he'd have to just take it. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1619.0s)]
*  He'd have to go, yeah, man, that's what happens when sharks get in the mountains is fucked [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1623.0s)]
*  up. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1627.0s)]
*  Yeah, she fell through a pothole in her imagination. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1628.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1632.0s)]
*  None of it made sense. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  There was one shooter who shot your father 18 times, but that shooter was blind. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1635.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was blind. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1643.0s)]
*  He was blind, man, shot your father in a hotel kitchen. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  So sad. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1648.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  Have you been to the place where the shooting happened? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  I have not. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1654.0s)]
*  You would have to actually pull. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1656.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1658.0s)]
*  You would have to lean out of a window. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1659.0s)]
*  Oh, that, yeah, JFK, I was at that. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1662.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is facing kind of the other way. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  You'd have to lean out of this window. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  You would have to have a friend hold your leg. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1669.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1672.0s)]
*  So you lean out of a window. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1673.0s)]
*  Yeah, at some point in that, someone would go, man, this is not a good idea. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1674.0s)]
*  We should do it another way. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1677.0s)]
*  There's like this. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1679.0s)]
*  There's no way this works. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1680.0s)]
*  It was impossible to do. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1681.0s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1683.0s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1684.0s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1685.0s)]
*  But he's for all that, he's like a remarkably well-adjusted guy. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1689.0s)]
*  I feel like he is. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1690.0s)]
*  I really feel like he's the best choice. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1691.0s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1694.0s)]
*  By the way, agreed. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1695.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1697.0s)]
*  As a human being that's going to, whether he's right or wrong about something, I would [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1698.0s)]
*  rather that someone cares and gives a fuck about whatever's going on. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1701.0s)]
*  The guy cares that they're injecting, could be injecting trash into people. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1705.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1711.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1712.0s)]
*  And the whole thing is like, what I like about him is that he like, he's, he's on, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1713.0s)]
*  he doesn't care. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1722.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1723.0s)]
*  He has nothing to lose. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1724.0s)]
*  They've taken everything from him. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1725.0s)]
*  They've taken everything from him. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1726.0s)]
*  They took his father. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1727.0s)]
*  He's out there just going, this is my truth. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1728.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1729.0s)]
*  There would be a lot more money in it if he just like went along with the rest of the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1730.0s)]
*  thing. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1734.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  If he just said, it replied to an email from Chuck Schumer. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1736.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1738.0s)]
*  He could be like, like he'd have a lot easier time if he just went along with everybody [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1739.0s)]
*  else. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1743.0s)]
*  But that's what I think is. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1744.0s)]
*  So yeah, I agree. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1745.0s)]
*  It's just that he's not beholding to anybody. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1746.0s)]
*  No, he's not beholding to anybody. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  That's kind of what he wants. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1750.0s)]
*  Do you think there's any path? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1751.0s)]
*  Cause I don't know if they'll let him on a lot of the ballots. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1753.0s)]
*  Are they letting him? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1755.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1756.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1757.0s)]
*  I think that there's rules that keep him off certain ballots. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  They want him to pay for his own thing. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1761.0s)]
*  Like crazy though. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1763.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1764.0s)]
*  But they're trying to like, yeah, I mean like they're just trying to close ranks around [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1765.0s)]
*  Biden. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1772.0s)]
*  They don't want. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1773.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1774.0s)]
*  They're really protecting Biden. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1775.0s)]
*  A lot of these lawyers are. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1776.0s)]
*  Cause by the way, you know, Biden has gotten to a point where it's almost a little fun [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1777.0s)]
*  now for the people around him because it is like a weekend at Bernie's. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  It's kind of fun because he's like essentially just almost at the death store and they're [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1784.0s)]
*  all now like, we're all in this together. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1790.0s)]
*  He's like death dash. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1792.0s)]
*  It's death dash. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1793.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1794.0s)]
*  We're there in it together now. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1795.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like we can't get out. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1796.0s)]
*  It's kind of fun. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1798.0s)]
*  Like late nights just propping them up, like playing with them like a puppet and going [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1799.0s)]
*  like, we're just going to put them out on the debate stage, like giving them good drugs, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1803.0s)]
*  injecting them like the injections that Biden gets before the first debate. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1807.0s)]
*  It will be nothing you've ever heard like teams of people. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1811.0s)]
*  You ever see the scene in ET where they put a tent around and they won't let anyone near [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1815.0s)]
*  it before Biden walks on that debate stage, there's going to be an ET like tent and just [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1820.0s)]
*  people in hazmat suits are going to go in and just start injecting them with things. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1825.0s)]

*  They're going to go. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1873.0s)]
*  We got a we got a really up up to dose here. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1874.0s)]
*  We're not I mean like he's not responding to the regular stimuli to really get in here [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1877.0s)]
*  with some like really intense because he just left the room. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1884.0s)]

*  They're like, if you forget, just give this speech that Tony Soprano gave to Anthony about [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1919.0s)]
*  World War II. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1926.0s)]
*  If that's the closest you can get to this question, read this scene from The Sopranos [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1927.0s)]
*  where Tony talked about the importance of Italian Americans during World War II. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1935.0s)]
*  It's going to be, he's going to be reading monologues from the movie Hoosiers whenever [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1940.0s)]
*  Gene Hackman tried to get Jimmy Chitwood to run the picket fence. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  It's going to be unbelievable. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1952.0s)]
*  By the way, that first debate I will be watching just like there's nothing more entertaining [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1955.0s)]
*  than that. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1961.0s)]
*  It's the Super Bowl for someone like me to just watch that go down. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1962.0s)]
*  It's old versus orange, baby. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1966.0s)]
*  It's old versus orange. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1967.0s)]
*  And it's just they're both wild. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1968.0s)]
*  Like Trump's going to be just popping off because now Trump's also four years older. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1970.0s)]
*  He doesn't even care anymore. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1974.0s)]
*  And who's more likely to even say the N word now? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1975.0s)]
*  It's different reasons because one could just bubble out of fucking up Biden or Trump could [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1977.0s)]
*  just fire one off that he earned back in the day. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1983.0s)]
*  What if both presidential candidates said the N word in the debate? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1985.0s)]
*  Well, if they did at the same time, I think it's what we all want to hear. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1987.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1990.0s)]
*  If they just both said it at the exact same time, then it would just be a reset. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1992.0s)]
*  Then the country, like at that point, if they, if Trump and Biden say the N word at the same [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=1997.0s)]
*  time in that debate, the Israelis and the Palestinians are just going to look at each [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2001.0s)]
*  other and start embracing it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2004.0s)]
*  They'll hug because that's what we need, really. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2006.0s)]
*  Oh, it's exactly what we need, man. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2008.0s)]
*  The fact that, but if Bobby Kennedy Jr. was out there and got to debate either one of [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2010.0s)]
*  them, I think he would crush them. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2016.0s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr. I think would absolutely wreak havoc in a debate. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  He should be out there. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2024.0s)]
*  Why can't he debate? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2026.0s)]
*  He's an independent candidate, right? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2027.0s)]
*  They just, these big parties try to keep everybody out because people try to get in there. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2029.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2035.0s)]
*  People try to get in there. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2036.0s)]
*  People just, I think Ben Glebe was trying to run for president. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2038.0s)]
*  So they just try to keep people out because it could get real wild. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2043.0s)]
*  The third party candidates could kind of get wild. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2048.0s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2051.0s)]
*  You'd have a bunch of, you'd have one of the Real Housewives. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2052.0s)]
*  You'd have an OnlyFans model. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2056.0s)]
*  Some OnlyFans model would get out there. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  Teresa Guidisi. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2060.0s)]
*  Yeah, for the Real Housewives, she'd get out there. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2061.0s)]
*  You know, it's still like you'd. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2063.0s)]
*  Charleston White probably would be out there, hopefully. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2065.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2068.0s)]
*  Get this bitch out there. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2069.0s)]
*  Jeepers, huh? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2071.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2072.0s)]
*  It looks like the fuck is literally reminds me of like the Muppets went to fucking make up. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2073.0s)]
*  But that's the problem. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2080.0s)]
*  So like, here's the thing. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2081.0s)]
*  Like as much as I don't think it's fair that they're keeping Bobby Kennedy out, they do need to keep certain people out. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2082.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2089.0s)]
*  Because it would just be a waste of time. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2090.0s)]
*  Yeah, Glee ran in 2020. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2092.0s)]
*  How did he do? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2094.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2095.0s)]
*  Yeah, how did he do? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2096.0s)]
*  Do we do? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2097.0s)]
*  Was there? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2099.0s)]
*  It's such a brave thing to do. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2100.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2101.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2102.0s)]
*  What does brave mean? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2105.0s)]
*  I think it's brave if you get to a certain level. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2106.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2108.0s)]
*  But if most people don't know you did it. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2109.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2110.0s)]
*  It's not that brave. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2111.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't successful. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2115.0s)]
*  I wonder if he. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2116.0s)]
*  It becomes brave. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2117.0s)]
*  Like Bobby Kennedy is brave. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2119.0s)]
*  But it's not that brave. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2120.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's just the way it goes. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2121.0s)]
*  The government says died from a headache. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2122.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2123.0s)]
*  And people are shocked. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2124.0s)]
*  Like, hey, why is this guy curious about these government mandated medications? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2125.0s)]
*  They're like, this guy should just trust his government. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2131.24s)]
*  What's wrong with him? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2133.92s)]
*  He won't trust his government. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2135.16s)]
*  By the way, your aunt died as she was struck by lightning eight times in her car. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2136.92s)]
*  Anyway, moving on. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2141.32s)]
*  So you know, I don't know, man. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2142.96s)]
*  I just, I'd like to maybe run for the governor of California, try to clean it up. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2145.36s)]
*  Where would you start? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2150.32s)]
*  We just had a homeless guy just threw a bird scooter through one of our producers girlfriend's [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2151.32s)]
*  windows. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2158.52s)]
*  I'm against that. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2159.52s)]
*  Are you? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2160.52s)]
*  That's my first. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2161.52s)]
*  That's my first thing. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2162.52s)]
*  No, it's against it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2163.52s)]
*  It's getting crazy. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2165.38s)]
*  Dude, there's a bunch of it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2166.38s)]
*  I told this story before, you know, some of the homeless or outdoorsmen or whatever, like [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2167.38s)]
*  new Native Americans, what some people are calling them. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2172.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2174.92s)]
*  How do the old Native Americans feel about that? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2175.92s)]
*  I don't think they should feel good about it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2178.68s)]
*  And I would love to see them rise up and attack the homeless. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2180.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's probably just for YouTube. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2184.12s)]
*  We want to be very careful. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2186.12s)]
*  We're not going for that. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2187.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2188.12s)]

*  by the value of an hour. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2303.04s)]

*  amount of stuff. Yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2322.8799999999997s)]

*  Oh, wow. Because one of them had a thing and another one had a thing. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2911.08s)]
*  They just they just each don't have an eye. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2914.0s)]
*  But no one ever is perverted yet. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2916.4s)]
*  No one no one. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2918.52s)]
*  No one even it's not even a big deal. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2920.44s)]
*  Well, nobody cares anymore. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2923.04s)]
*  It's like, unless you're willing to really take your fucking limbs off. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2924.16s)]
*  That's right. And put them in your own ass. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2928.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You got to do something with those. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2930.48s)]
*  You got to fucking what just happened in the news. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2931.7599999999998s)]
*  Wasn't there something we're looking at earlier, Nick? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2934.12s)]
*  Oh, man arrested for faking heart attack in over 20 restaurants. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2936.9199999999996s)]
*  I respect this. I respect this nowadays because at least this guy is even [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2941.3999999999996s)]
*  it used to be this you did a slip and fall in a Walmart or whatever. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2946.0s)]
*  You got twenty five thousand and then you raised a son or whatever. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2949.24s)]
*  But now at least this guy, a 50 year old from Lithuania, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2953.7999999999997s)]
*  was recently arrested in Spain. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2957.8799999999997s)]
*  At least he's willing to travel and see the world after allegedly faking heart [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2960.0s)]
*  attacks at several restaurants in order to avoid paying the bill. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2964.96s)]
*  What's great about this to me is that this guy, you know, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2967.6800000000003s)]
*  like is basically going out there and he knows one of them is going to be real. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2971.88s)]
*  Yeah. Like he knows. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2978.32s)]
*  Oh, he's playing. Is this live by the sword, die by the sword? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2980.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2982.96s)]
*  it's the classic boy who cried wolf. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2986.96s)]
*  Like he goes one of these days it's going to be real. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2989.36s)]
*  But he's like, not today. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2991.96s)]
*  He's like, not today. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2993.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2994.6s)]
*  There's only so many times you can try to teach your aortas to talk. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=2997.2000000000003s)]
*  And then finally they fucking yell. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3000.48s)]
*  When you fake a heart attack, that's got to be a lot. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3002.32s)]
*  Yeah. But your heart's like, hey, what's going on? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3004.44s)]
*  Maybe I should learn this. Right. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3006.56s)]
*  So eventually it's just going to be a real one. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3008.56s)]
*  But I love that this guy's willing to put in work. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3012.56s)]
*  This is what you're going to have to do now to entertain the lords, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3014.6800000000003s)]
*  the insurance lords. Yes. Yes. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3018.08s)]
*  What did the guy do? He just oh, he fucking broke his leg. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3020.6400000000003s)]
*  He wants on a bad pothole. Fuck him. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3023.24s)]
*  You're going to have to fake a lot of stuff. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3025.24s)]
*  Yeah. This guy at least, he, yeah, he faked 20 heart attacks. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3027.4399999999996s)]
*  Let's give him a couple thousand dollars, you know? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3031.4399999999996s)]
*  And it's we only care about a heart attack. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3034.3599999999997s)]
*  That's how heartless we are. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3036.04s)]
*  You have to be incapacitated. Yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3037.8799999999997s)]
*  You can't just go in and go, like, I don't have a lot of money. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3039.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I have hives or whatever. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3042.56s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck. No one cares. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3043.8799999999997s)]
*  I have shingles. Yeah, I was molested. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3045.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Get fucked. No one cares. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3047.12s)]
*  Can you imagine going into a place, I was molested and the waitress going, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3049.6s)]
*  I was also molested. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3053.0s)]
*  So what? Do you want the breadsticks? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3055.04s)]
*  Because they're eight dollars. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3058.04s)]
*  They charge for bread. Yeah. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3059.24s)]
*  Go to a restaurant. Yeah. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3060.6s)]
*  They charge for bread and butter. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3061.8s)]
*  They charge for bread and butter. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3063.48s)]
*  Used to be able as a homeless person to go in, fake it out, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3064.72s)]
*  and get a little bread and butter and yeah, maybe get a soup in. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3067.96s)]
*  Yeah. Like, oh, this came from home. Yeah. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3070.68s)]
*  Yeah. Does this at the house? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3072.88s)]
*  You know, looking at the remote or something and lie. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3074.32s)]
*  Times have changed. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3077.28s)]
*  It is. It's interesting. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3079.6s)]
*  What's going on in your world, I guess, dude? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3080.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, I'm I'm I'm just trying to, you know, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3083.2s)]
*  trying to live out the the dream of, you know, being grateful for being [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3088.2s)]
*  lucky enough to make people happy. Yeah. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3094.24s)]
*  Hopefully, you know, it almost feels there's a lot. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3096.68s)]
*  There's a lot to that where you got to kind of always remind yourself [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3099.24s)]
*  that you're doing a fun thing and a cool thing. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3102.24s)]
*  And you don't want to get caught up in any of the bullshit and the nonsense of it. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3104.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of hard to. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3108.24s)]
*  Well, it's not hard, but it's like it can. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3110.24s)]
*  I can see how it can happen. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3112.12s)]
*  You almost, though, see like so many like celebrities and like Hollywood [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3113.52s)]
*  is such a example of all of that. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3118.4799999999996s)]
*  So I think as comedians these days, it seems like you have such a good example [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3121.24s)]
*  of like the avenues not to go down. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3125.08s)]
*  Yeah. Just try to keep your head about you and do and get excited about what you're doing. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3127.3599999999997s)]
*  A lot of it becomes about like, how big can it be or how is there your reps? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3132.68s)]
*  You go, there's money here. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3137.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's money, you know, and then you just got to be like, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3139.24s)]
*  but am I happy with like the things I'm actually doing? Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3141.6s)]
*  Am I putting stuff out that's funny? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3144.7599999999998s)]
*  So that's like the hard part. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3146.2s)]
*  Again, who do you want? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3148.8399999999997s)]
*  If there is somebody you really wanted to do, like a television or film, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3149.8799999999997s)]
*  you'd have to really want to do it because we're lucky enough to be able to go [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3153.04s)]
*  and perform to really love it. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3156.2799999999997s)]
*  There's something I really want to do. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3158.08s)]
*  There's like one thing I've always wanted to do. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3160.08s)]
*  And I don't know how I'll do it or who I'll do it with. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3162.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's just that one thing. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3165.52s)]
*  Like I don't have 10 things. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3166.92s)]
*  Yeah. And if I never get to do it, that's OK, too, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3168.32s)]
*  because I've been able to do a lot of other things. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3170.28s)]
*  But there's just one idea. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3172.16s)]
*  It could be a show, could be a movie. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3173.36s)]
*  It's just one thing I've always wanted to do. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3174.36s)]
*  And I just want to do that. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3176.0s)]
*  And then I'd be done. You'd be good with that. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3177.4s)]
*  I'd be good with that. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3179.16s)]
*  So that might happen or it may not happen. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3180.08s)]
*  And I'd also be good with it not happening [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3182.32s)]
*  because I think at a certain point, you've got to give it to God and go, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3184.04s)]
*  if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3186.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think like David Spade and I wrote that film that maybe you would be in. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3188.76s)]
*  I love that. Super cool. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3192.08s)]
*  So that would be cool. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3194.04s)]
*  I'd be doing something with Drew Ski, I think would be neat. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3195.36s)]
*  Amazing. He's so funny. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3197.6400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, outside of that, I don't know if I have much ambition. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3200.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it would have to be something you really loved [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3202.28s)]
*  and you wanted to do it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3204.2400000000002s)]
*  I really love it because we have the ability to go out and make people happy [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3205.28s)]
*  that are right in front of us. So fortunate. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3209.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people don't like a lot of actors. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3211.6000000000004s)]
*  You meet actors and they're just waiting for people to call them. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3213.7200000000003s)]
*  It used to be like actors would, you know, they'd be like happy. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3219.6800000000003s)]
*  Now you talk to them, they're like, they're like not happy. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3224.96s)]

*  He can't play Rosa Parks. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3280.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3282.72s)]

*  And we're going to take their likeness and use it again. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3311.64s)]
*  So Chalamet will be like you'll be watching a movie [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3314.48s)]
*  and he'll just maybe be two or three of the characters. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=3317.7999999999997s)]

*  But what was the issue with Dyrdek? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4032.1200000000003s)]
*  Can you bring that article back up? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4033.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they store ridiculous writer, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4035.92s)]
*  ridiculousness writers stormed Rob Dyrdek's office asking for a meeting, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4037.92s)]
*  but he was nowhere to be found. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4041.76s)]
*  So they straight up tried to get him. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4042.88s)]
*  Yeah. On January 4th, the writers of Ridiculousness [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4045.0s)]
*  asked host and executive producer Rob Dyrdek for his support for a fair contract. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4047.76s)]
*  Wow. Wow. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4052.5600000000004s)]

*  Apparently around 10 of the show's writers stormed Dyrdek's office, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4054.28s)]
*  but were turned away when they called and left messages no one answered. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4057.6s)]
*  Because you know what it is? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4060.72s)]
*  They looked at January 6th and they go, that got some results like that. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4061.32s)]
*  Woke people up a little bit. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4064.96s)]
*  That got some heat. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4066.16s)]
*  You know, that got some heat, you know, rightly or wrongly. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4066.88s)]
*  It got some heat. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4069.2799999999997s)]
*  So I think a lot of these writers were like, let's just storm his office right now. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4069.96s)]
*  Yeah. And try to like. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4073.56s)]
*  They asked host Dyrdek for support for a fair contract. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4076.24s)]
*  Ryan Connor, I am here. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4080.16s)]
*  I know my fellow writers and Rob's office is a nice guy [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4082.0s)]

*  Oh, no, that's OK. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4097.04s)]
*  We called. We left a message. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4098.72s)]
*  Nobody answered. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4100.08s)]
*  Hi, this is the writers from Ridiculousness. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4101.36s)]
*  We are here in the ground floor of the building. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4104.44s)]
*  Just ask if we can. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4107.48s)]
*  That's good. Talk to Rob. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4108.96s)]
*  So it looks like they're trying to go there and get a hold of them and they can't. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4110.24s)]
*  Is that the gist of it, Nick? That is. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4112.92s)]
*  That's a gist. And you know that guy, Ryan Connor? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4114.72s)]
*  Yeah, he was a nice guy. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4116.84s)]
*  He was a comic in New York City. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4117.8s)]
*  And I guess he moved out here, I guess, became a writer. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4119.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. And what did that article say towards the end? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4122.0s)]
*  Nick, do you mind? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4124.12s)]
*  Um, oh, it said, we are currently compensated at a rate well below our peers. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4126.04s)]
*  No. Well below our peers, writing for WGA coverage shows like Ridiculousness. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4130.8s)]
*  The next step is you're going to have to kidnap him. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4135.88s)]
*  Well, and they're going to call and they're going to go, we have him. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4138.280000000001s)]
*  Like we have Rob Dyrdek. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4141.320000000001s)]
*  And what do you want from him? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4143.56s)]
*  And yeah, and I'm not saying that I condone that. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4144.48s)]
*  So, of course not. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4147.36s)]
*  But I'm saying like the next step logically, logically is to kidnap Rob Dyrdek. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4148.28s)]
*  And they're going to go high and he can do it like just the way he did it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4152.719999999999s)]
*  He'd be like, hey, I'm Ryan Connor. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4155.5599999999995s)]
*  And I just want to say we have Rob Dyrdek. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4157.599999999999s)]
*  But it's just like we tried it the first way. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4160.28s)]
*  Yeah, we tried it your way. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4162.4s)]
*  We went to the lobby. Remember that? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4163.639999999999s)]
*  It's like Terminator. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4165.0s)]
*  I knew he's in a box. He has box. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4165.919999999999s)]

*  And Ryan goes, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4172.32s)]

*  Now, the reason that everybody was so wound up in Seven [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4420.84s)]
*  is because there's a serial killer [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4425.12s)]
*  who just kept like leaving little notes. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4428.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4430.92s)]
*  And communicating with the cops, making phone calls. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4432.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, gossipy kind of guy. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4434.16s)]
*  Gossipy kind of guy. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4435.320000000001s)]
*  But he didn't show up in the, you know, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4436.16s)]
*  like the office building, you know what I mean? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4438.280000000001s)]
*  What he was able to do is really capture people's attention [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4440.56s)]
*  by actually going like, hey, I got the, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4444.16s)]
*  I got the guy. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4447.04s)]
*  So, the reality is, what they need to do is just, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4449.92s)]
*  in a nice way, kidnap him. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4452.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think commandeering is the term we like to use. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4456.72s)]
*  That's correct. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4459.68s)]
*  Commandeering someone. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4460.52s)]
*  Commandeering someone. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4461.96s)]
*  For the purposes of a contract negotiation is great. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4463.52s)]
*  Well, look, it's getting to that point. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4468.320000000001s)]
*  I won't be, because at one point, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4470.200000000001s)]
*  all it's gonna take is the policeman to say, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4471.68s)]
*  wait, I'm not on the side of this company. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4474.4800000000005s)]
*  No, the police. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4477.040000000001s)]
*  I'm on the side of this person. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4477.88s)]
*  Here's the brilliant thing about this. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4479.64s)]
*  The police might help this. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4480.76s)]
*  The police actually. How was that? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4482.96s)]
*  The police might, they might not look too hard for him. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4485.320000000001s)]
*  They might not be looking too hard for him. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4491.360000000001s)]
*  Because the show, I believe, is celebrating accidents. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4494.4400000000005s)]
*  Celebrating just public lawlessness. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4497.56s)]
*  The cops aren't looking too hard for this guy. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4501.0s)]
*  And plus, here's the thing. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4503.080000000001s)]
*  If they're not paying people for the clips that I'm using, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4503.96s)]
*  I'm sure they're not, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4506.56s)]
*  and they're not paying guests to go on there. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4507.68s)]
*  And I. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4509.64s)]
*  There's probably some guy on a stretcher, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4510.4800000000005s)]
*  and then just a producer runs up to him and they go, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4512.96s)]
*  do you mind if we use this on Ridiculousness? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4515.360000000001s)]
*  And the guy's like, and they're like, great. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4517.280000000001s)]
*  That counts. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4519.56s)]
*  Yeah, well you're putting your saliva on this contract. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4520.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4523.88s)]
*  But I, and I remember them offering, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4525.120000000001s)]
*  and they did not offer a payment on it. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4526.92s)]
*  But then who's making all the money then? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4528.96s)]
*  Probably the network. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4531.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the show these days, it's only ridiculous. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4532.84s)]
*  It's their own, what was the deal they had? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4536.56s)]
*  And I'm all for people making money. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4539.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm not trying to shit on Rob. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4541.72s)]
*  Maybe it's just a misunderstanding, but. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4543.040000000001s)]
*  No, and maybe he's doing the right thing. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4545.320000000001s)]
*  I'm not. Right. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4546.8s)]
*  We're not being negative. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4547.92s)]
*  We're just saying, I'm zooming out. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4549.92s)]
*  I'm zooming out that this is an overall, this. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4552.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't even care who he is, who they are. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4554.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm just talking about negotiations in general. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4557.400000000001s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4560.24s)]
*  One person usually has all the leverage, is my point. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4561.08s)]
*  And if you, yeah, and sometimes you have to bring [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4564.4800000000005s)]
*  a true article to the. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4567.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, like what the writers did there, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4571.0s)]
*  we had no imagination. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4573.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4574.2s)]
*  Which maybe, both of these, they shouldn't be getting paid. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4575.28s)]
*  I gotta be honest, I didn't see one funny thing happen. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4578.68s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4580.68s)]
*  There was not one funny thing those writers did. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4581.64s)]
*  But sometimes you gotta bring a real article [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4583.16s)]
*  to the negotiation table. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4584.6s)]
*  What if they all dressed up like clowns? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4585.4400000000005s)]
*  And they were like, oh, you're treating us like clowns, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4587.4400000000005s)]
*  but bloody clowns. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4588.92s)]
*  Or big, like remember Big that passed away? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4589.96s)]
*  Remember Robin Big? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4592.4400000000005s)]
*  What if they all dressed up like Big? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4593.320000000001s)]
*  And like mummified Big, like we came back from the grave. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4595.16s)]
*  And Big would be ashamed of this. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4597.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4599.4800000000005s)]
*  Big would be ashamed of the way we're being treated. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4600.320000000001s)]
*  Kind of like a Christmas story, like a Christmas carol. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4602.400000000001s)]
*  RIP Big, too, man. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4605.4800000000005s)]
*  RIP Big. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4606.56s)]
*  So our thing is telling the writers to do blackface. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4608.12s)]
*  Well, I'd go. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4611.48s)]
*  Sure, but I'm just saying. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4613.96s)]
*  At this point. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4615.2s)]
*  At this point, you're desperate times. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4616.04s)]
*  Affirmative action. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4617.24s)]
*  Desperate measures. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4618.16s)]
*  And I get it. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4619.0s)]
*  Now a black writer, you get it. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4620.2s)]
*  They call Rob Dyrdek to go, listen, listen to this. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4622.04s)]
*  The writers are mad, they're in the lobby of the building. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4624.48s)]
*  Here's where they fucked up, Rob. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4626.759999999999s)]
*  They're all in blackface. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4628.639999999999s)]
*  You're off the hook. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4629.96s)]
*  You're actually. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4631.2s)]
*  Or. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4632.04s)]
*  You don't have to pay any of them. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4632.879999999999s)]
*  Or Hollywood's so scared of everything, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4633.719999999999s)]
*  like we better pay these black writers right now. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4635.5199999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4637.599999999999s)]
*  That's the truth. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4638.24s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4638.92s)]
*  Hollywood would be like, the last thing we want to do [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4639.96s)]
*  is upset the black community. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4641.5599999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4643.0s)]
*  They come in. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4643.839999999999s)]
*  If I were black, I would just sue everybody in Hollywood. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4644.679999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4647.92s)]
*  To be honest with you. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4648.759999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4651.04s)]
*  To be honest with you. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4652.0s)]
*  To start suing every human being in Hollywood. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4652.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I just know that Rob has the biggest. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4655.92s)]
*  He is, all that's on MTV is. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4658.799999999999s)]
*  I don't even know what MTV is anymore. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4661.599999999999s)]
*  But all the tour is ridiculous. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4663.44s)]
*  Well, hey, like I said, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4666.2s)]
*  everybody's gotta do what they want to do in this world. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4669.04s)]
*  What else were we looking at, Nick? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4673.599999999999s)]
*  What else had you brought up? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4674.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, neighbors say Party House in Beverly Hills [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4678.4s)]
*  is run by squatters. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4680.759999999999s)]

*  They're like, we're in this house, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4966.599999999999s)]
*  we're squatting in the house, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4968.0s)]
*  and we're just trying to get Rob Dyrdek to pay us money [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4969.84s)]
*  so we can get apartments so we don't have to live [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4973.04s)]
*  in this mansion of this murderer. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4975.0s)]
*  Look, if there are extremely wealthy people out of town, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4976.679999999999s)]
*  I and you, and they are, you consider them [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4979.599999999999s)]
*  or people in your area consider them some lord [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4982.16s)]
*  or deviant or dark artist. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4984.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4986.16s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4987.0s)]
*  with spending time in their home. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4988.08s)]
*  They have a pool. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4990.04s)]
*  The pool didn't kill anyone. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4991.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not even there. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4993.0s)]
*  Did the terrorists kill someone? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4993.92s)]
*  No. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4996.2s)]
*  So you're basically going into a piece of real estate. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=4997.04s)]
*  I think real estate's blameless. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5000.16s)]
*  I agree. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5002.28s)]
*  I did not blame, I don't blame Brentwood [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5003.12s)]
*  for O.J.'s activities. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5005.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5007.04s)]
*  I don't look at the house and go, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5007.88s)]
*  oh, you look at this, I mean, they've demolished it now. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5009.04s)]
*  But Epstein's townhouse didn't do anything wrong. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5012.92s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5015.88s)]
*  It's the people inside. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5016.72s)]
*  Yeah, and so I think, yeah, if there's a house [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5019.8s)]
*  in a fancy area and you love it, get in there, I think. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5021.64s)]
*  I think get in there and look for murderers [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5025.16s)]
*  in your area who fled. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5027.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5029.16s)]
*  Because all it takes is two or three houses [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5030.68s)]
*  in a neighborhood for this avenue, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5033.88s)]
*  and then the property values all come down [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5035.32s)]
*  and we just all for rent again. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5037.64s)]
*  And by the way, if you live in a nice area, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5039.36s)]
*  there are definitely a few murderers who have fled. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5041.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's really just a matter [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5044.84s)]
*  of you doing the legwork online. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5047.24s)]
*  100%, finding it. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5049.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5051.04s)]
*  And because it's always gonna appear like, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5051.88s)]
*  oh, nobody's been in that house for a while, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5054.48s)]
*  I wonder why it is, and then you're gonna find out, oh. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5056.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5060.12s)]
*  Sometimes people's kids kill people and they check out. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5060.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's easy to figure out too. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5063.84s)]
*  And a lot of times, I think, look, go through Halloween, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5066.04s)]
*  see who doesn't have a trick or treating thing set up. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5068.2s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5070.68s)]
*  And those are the first people's houses to stop in at [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5071.52s)]
*  and see what's going on. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5074.0s)]
*  And eventually, the government is. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5075.12s)]
*  Don't do it in my house, I'm just in Reno, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5076.6s)]
*  performing in a casino. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5078.72s)]
*  I didn't kill anyone. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5080.240000000001s)]
*  So I just wanna put that out there. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5081.400000000001s)]
*  I have a nice home. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5083.160000000001s)]
*  Don't come to my house, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5084.240000000001s)]
*  because I am coming back in two days. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5085.240000000001s)]
*  I'm probably in Boston or something, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5087.280000000001s)]
*  just screaming at drunks. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5089.8s)]
*  You think it's okay for people to get into more [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5093.08s)]
*  of the squatting and the commandeering? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5094.88s)]
*  It goes back. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5097.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a case by case because. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5098.320000000001s)]
*  Do you think so? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5099.4400000000005s)]
*  It goes back to the old times where it's like, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5100.759999999999s)]
*  when you showed up and you took some land, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5103.08s)]
*  I feel like that's the times we're getting back to. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5104.88s)]
*  And I think it's okay. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5107.08s)]
*  Well, here's where. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5109.0s)]
*  People can't afford rents. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5109.84s)]
*  How else do you expect people [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5111.5199999999995s)]
*  when seven families or whatever own half the city? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5113.679999999999s)]
*  It's a great point. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5119.0s)]
*  I think the problem becomes, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5121.36s)]
*  like, when you are squatting in a house of, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5123.4s)]
*  like, I don't know, somebody. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5129.24s)]
*  Like somebody who's disabled or something? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5134.32s)]
*  Well, no, but maybe what's going on. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5135.759999999999s)]
*  Like, it does, I don't know. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5137.719999999999s)]
*  You're envisioning, what you're envisioning [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5138.96s)]
*  is like a family who's down on their luck. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5140.799999999999s)]
*  Is like, we're gonna squat in this house. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5144.36s)]
*  Oh, I'm also envisioning a couple of rager boys [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5146.44s)]
*  from freaking. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5148.639999999999s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5149.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, here's the deal. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5150.4s)]
*  I think what you're gonna get, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5151.24s)]
*  and you're gonna get a lot of, like, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5152.4s)]
*  you might get some activity in that property [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5154.72s)]
*  that's not great for the neighborhood. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5158.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, I think that's what I want. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5160.68s)]
*  Okay, all right, sure. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5162.400000000001s)]

*  We'll have a blue... [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5730.64s)]
*  But it's getting so bad. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5732.8s)]
*  Little people are squatting as infants to eat, to survive. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5734.2s)]
*  That's how bad it's... [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5739.2s)]
*  People don't understand when it goes from grapes [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5740.4s)]
*  to grapes of wrath, man. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5743.4s)]
*  People don't understand it. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5744.64s)]
*  Because there are a lot of little people that can [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5745.96s)]
*  and should kind of try to pass as children. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5749.04s)]
*  Oh, they bet... [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5751.72s)]
*  Did they get in a car on the way to a Six Flags, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5752.8s)]
*  try to get in, be with the family? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5755.96s)]
*  They had a guy in Indiana. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5757.84s)]
*  He, if you get a chance, they looked at him. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5758.88s)]
*  He was like 31, and he had primordial dwarfism, I think. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5760.92s)]
*  He went back to third grade, right? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5766.6s)]
*  Went to third grade, was doing pretty good. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5769.72s)]
*  They said he wasn't even doing that good in it. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5771.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, God. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5773.280000000001s)]
*  Well, third grade's not easy. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5774.52s)]
*  That's when they start bringing out the big math textbooks. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5775.64s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5777.8s)]
*  Yeah, oh, Six-Year-Old Orphan or Con Artist Adult, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5778.92s)]
*  Revisiting the Strange... [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5782.68s)]
*  Oh, no, this was Nat and Natalia Grace. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5783.8s)]
*  This was a male, but that was the Russian child. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5785.4400000000005s)]
*  But they had a male who pretended... [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5789.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I would say dwarf impersonates child, Indiana. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5798.12s)]
*  It's a very interesting move. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5803.96s)]
*  And to me, it's like something that... [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5807.8s)]
*  And other states, but and other states. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5809.36s)]
*  I feel like it's totally appropriate, you know? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5810.92s)]
*  Given the way things are. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5813.8s)]
*  Yeah, oh, but I'm just not shocked that this is... [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5816.72s)]
*  But this guy went back to school, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5819.24s)]
*  and one day the teacher saw him driving somewhere, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5820.72s)]
*  driving to an Applebee's or something. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5823.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5825.4s)]
*  And that's how they busted him. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5826.24s)]
*  Like, shouldn't you be doing your homework? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5827.32s)]
*  Right, and then he was like, no, I'm actually... [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5829.32s)]
*  But it's a weird move to just wanna go to school, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5831.92s)]
*  but I guess he was getting fed and taken care of. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5835.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a lot of that. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5837.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, it's free, then you're on the government's dime. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5838.280000000001s)]
*  That's right, and you know what? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5840.16s)]
*  It's like, he's like, let me try again. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5841.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, let me relive it, yeah. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5843.68s)]
*  Like, everybody wants to kind of relive it. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5845.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'd love to go back. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5847.16s)]
*  So, like, to me, it's like that's also heartwarming [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5848.0s)]
*  that little people can kind of relive it. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5850.2s)]
*  And I think if you are a little person [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5852.68s)]
*  and you do feel better around children, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5854.280000000001s)]
*  you should be able to go back to school. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5855.8s)]

*  Run it back. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8eE-s497YQ&t=5859.64s)]
