*  Let's say in the middle of nowhere, there's water. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=743.34s)]

*  And you're in the ocean in the middle of nowhere. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=751.98s)]
*  And, you know, you're just floating, trying to stay a stay afloat. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=754.3000000000001s)]
*  And then some goddamn big ass whale pulls up. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=759.4200000000001s)]
*  You see that first, dude. First, you see that in the distance. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=763.58s)]

*  And there's not much you can do. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=771.22s)]
*  I think if you hear is it something you urinate around you, it won't come by you. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=772.6600000000001s)]
*  What is that? Shark. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=776.2600000000001s)]
*  Maybe I'm really sure. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=779.3000000000001s)]
*  That was sharks. I don't know about whales. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=780.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm really scared of sharks, too, man. All that shit. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=781.9s)]
*  Maybe jellyfish, if you pee on a jellyfish or something to leave you alone. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=784.14s)]
*  And if you if you get stung by jellyfish, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=787.14s)]
*  then you're supposed to pee on the on the sting. Oh, damn. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=789.26s)]
*  But did I would pee? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=792.9s)]
*  I mean, the only thing you could do is probably pee, I think would probably [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=793.86s)]
*  keep it away from you. I don't know. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=796.54s)]
*  I don't know. Do whales go away from urine? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=798.02s)]
*  Can you run that? Yeah, I'm Googling it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=799.9s)]
*  I think I would just accept my fate, man. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=802.3s)]
*  I think I would just lay there, close my eyes and be like. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=804.38s)]
*  So I can swim away from that motherfucker. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=808.62s)]
*  But but but whales don't eat people. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=810.18s)]
*  It would be an accident if it ate me. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=811.86s)]
*  You see that whale swallow those two girls? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=814.02s)]
*  Yeah. We on the canoe. Yeah. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=815.86s)]
*  Oh, that was crazy, dude. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=817.46s)]
*  Oh, can you imagine? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=818.86s)]
*  And it it sent those bitches back. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=820.54s)]
*  Yeah, they survived. They survived. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=824.18s)]
*  But imagine being a whale's mouth and then coming out [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=825.62s)]
*  and then living the rest of your life. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=827.6999999999999s)]
*  But imagine getting rejected by a whale. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  Obviously, these these chicks don't have guys. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=831.3s)]
*  I mean, out there together. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=833.98s)]
*  Like imagine rejected by a whale. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=835.7s)]
*  I don't think whales can even like digest a human man. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=838.06s)]
*  I think I'm just afraid of them [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=841.06s)]
*  like whipping me with their tail or some shit. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=842.22s)]
*  Oh, and you're taller, too. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=844.18s)]
*  I think that's one of the disadvantages of being tall. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=845.78s)]
*  Is there's this there's more of you to get hit. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=848.66s)]
*  There's more you to get caught in a woodchip or there's more of you [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=851.02s)]
*  to get in a wood or just like anything, anything that's loose. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=854.8199999999999s)]
*  If there's something, you know, a machine, there's a lot. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=858.3s)]
*  You have a there's a more of a landscape. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=860.5s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's like, I don't know. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=862.74s)]
*  I have to worry about probably a foot less than you. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=865.26s)]
*  See, one thing that I've been told by friends and I kind of think is [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=867.86s)]
*  is a fact is that I'm I'm sick between six, seven and six, eight. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=871.4200000000001s)]
*  But like my brain, I think only really is aware of like six, five. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=876.86s)]
*  So I have like an extra like two inches of my body that just kind of [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm a little I'm not clumsy, but like [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=884.86s)]
*  I'm good about hitting my head on shit, hitting my arms on shit, breaking bones. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=887.26s)]
*  Like I think I'm just like a little bit. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=891.1800000000001s)]
*  My brain hasn't caught up to the height. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=893.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it ever will. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=895.42s)]
*  Wow, that's fascinating, man. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=897.26s)]
*  I just I didn't know that something like that could happen to people [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=899.38s)]
*  because they say also if you lose an arm somewhere [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=902.06s)]
*  and you like punch somebody, you can still almost feel like you're punching somebody. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=905.26s)]
*  The Phantom Pain should be so interesting to me. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=908.78s)]
*  One of our old tour bus drivers just got his leg amputated. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=911.18s)]
*  And like like I was just really curious. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=914.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's my boy. I said, dude, Keith shot at Keith. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=916.74s)]
*  Was he a smoker? No, he he got off like a like an infection in his ankle [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=919.06s)]
*  or something and just didn't treat it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=923.2199999999999s)]
*  And like, I guess enough time went by. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=925.18s)]
*  We had to amputate his leg up to like here, like upper thigh. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=928.14s)]
*  He sent me a picture. It was crazy. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=931.26s)]
*  That's my boy. So I like wanted to learn more about it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=933.54s)]
*  And like, like, it's really interesting how that Phantom Pain works. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=935.5s)]
*  You know, yeah. Phantom limb activity. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=939.0999999999999s)]

*  I don't know. Yeah, it's crazy that are so it just it starts to make you wonder [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=950.6999999999999s)]
*  what different interesting things are there about our brain? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=954.54s)]
*  Because bring up Phantom Pain, Zach. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=957.6999999999999s)]
*  Phantom Pain is pain that feels like it's coming from a body part [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=962.62s)]
*  that's no longer there. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=965.74s)]
*  Doctors once believed this post amputation phenomenon was a psychological problem. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=966.98s)]
*  But experts now recognize these real sensations originate in the spinal cord. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=971.38s)]
*  So it's like you don't even have the arm, but like your your cells [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=974.74s)]
*  are telling you that there's some shit there and it hurts. Yeah. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=977.6999999999999s)]
*  It just makes me wonder like what our brain can really do. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=980.74s)]
*  Like, are we mad? Because that's kind of that's some wild shit. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=983.78s)]
*  It's a lot of wild shit, man. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=987.78s)]
*  I swear to God, I was doing DMT earlier today and I was like today today. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=989.26s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, with a pen, you can just hit it and it's kind of casual, you know? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=993.5s)]
*  And I was just thinking about it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=997.1s)]
*  I was like, man, like I was looking at all my boys. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=997.9s)]
*  I was kind of hung over. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1000.5799999999999s)]
*  I wasn't like feeling perfect. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1001.66s)]
*  And then I was like, like, damn, man, like this is just good for me right now. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1002.8199999999999s)]
*  It's bad for me. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1007.38s)]
*  My brain was just like focusing on so many things at once. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1008.14s)]
*  And it's like, you know, they say you only use like 20 percent of your brain or something. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1011.14s)]
*  Yeah. And I feel like there's been moments when I was on acid where I was, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1015.46s)]
*  I don't know, maybe it's just me being all excited or whatever. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1018.62s)]
*  But I was like, oh, I'm using that other music, at least another five percent. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1020.74s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1024.18s)]
*  Yeah. You find extra gear. Oh, yeah, dude. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1025.3s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, shit. Oh, God. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1028.58s)]
*  I was I was way too much of my [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1031.06s)]
*  antidepressant on accident. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1034.58s)]
*  I had like hadn't taken two weeks. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1036.1s)]
*  And I thought I was taking like just like half of a dose. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1037.9s)]
*  But like I grabbed the wrong one and it was like three times the normal dose. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1040.34s)]
*  But I hadn't taken any weeks. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1044.1s)]
*  And I like went like this weird super saiyan mode where I was like [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1045.1399999999999s)]
*  thinking fast as shit. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1048.58s)]
*  And I felt like a genius, but I was. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1049.82s)]
*  But it actually was good ideas. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1051.4599999999998s)]

*  That's what it is. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1552.74s)]

*  the local police did. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1562.66s)]
*  So then the judge gave me a plea deal where like everything would get dropped [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1564.22s)]
*  except for one misdemeanor. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1567.38s)]

*  He kept it. It was it was criminal trespassing. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1570.9s)]
*  I got another one like two years later in Georgia for breaking into a tire store. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1574.02s)]
*  That's a whole different. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1577.7s)]
*  So don't go to Georgia is kind of the place. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1578.46s)]
*  Georgia is where I where I where I fuck up. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1580.38s)]
*  Yeah. Anyways, I [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1582.42s)]
*  I had a good friend from high school who managed a thrift shop in [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1586.14s)]
*  Bozeman, Montana. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1591.0600000000002s)]
*  And I was like, I need to get away from all my friends back home in Minnesota. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1592.5s)]
*  They're going to be like they're going to convince me to do drugs or something. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  So I just drove out, brought my boy Preston. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1598.3000000000002s)]
*  I was like, just come with me. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1601.54s)]
*  And he ended up moving there after that because it is a beautiful place. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1602.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But yeah, I moved into this house and he gave us a room with like three [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1604.9s)]
*  mattresses. And then I realized that we had like people. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1608.9s)]
*  There's people that would sleep in the back in a yurt. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1612.22s)]
*  There are people that sleep in the front in a truck. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1614.34s)]
*  And then we would have like every room had two people in it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1616.8999999999999s)]
*  So it was like it was like a little company and we'd have like community [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1618.94s)]
*  dinners and everything and do DMT. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1621.3799999999999s)]

*  I woke up every day and did 10 hours of community service [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1629.82s)]
*  and then went home and was on me and shit. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1633.1399999999999s)]

*  Is it kind of a halfway house for people doing community service? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1637.82s)]
*  No, no, not at all. OK. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1639.98s)]

*  And I was the one kid that had to do community service. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1642.58s)]
*  So they were all going on hikes and going on trips and did all their cool shit. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1644.98s)]

*  But but but here's the thing was that part of my plea deal was if you break any [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1649.9s)]
*  law within the next 18 months until you're out probation, you go to jail [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1654.62s)]
*  for the rest of 18 months. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=1659.18s)]

*  I'll kind of notice something funny that I say with my friends and I'm like, okay, this is a [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3082.98s)]
*  bead on something. It's almost like a welder when they light that bead up and then they start using [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3086.5s)]
*  the bead to do all the welding. What does it feel like for you as you've gotten to know yourself [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3091.14s)]
*  better? Honestly, I listen to a lot of really old music. I listen to hip hop when I want to get [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3096.7400000000002s)]
*  hyped up, but most of what I'm casually listening to on an airplane or whatever it is, is usually [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3105.2200000000003s)]
*  like some 40s to 70s era. A lot of times I'll just find a sample in there that I really like [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3110.1s)]
*  and the vibe of it. I'll send it to like, I got a couple of producers that are really good with [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3116.58s)]
*  flipping those. And then in the end, we'll replay it with our own instruments so that there's less [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3120.8199999999997s)]
*  legal shit to go through. Also, I mean, half the sessions I do, I'll just go in with the producer [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3127.86s)]
*  or kind of chop it up a little bit and think of something. Like the song Soiree I dropped not [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3134.74s)]
*  long ago. I walked in and I was like, hey bro, let's make a Beethoven joint. Let's make a [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3139.06s)]
*  Beethoven song. And he was like, all right, bet. And he just shouted it to Willie, legendary producer, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3144.9s)]
*  just whooped out his fucking piano, recorded it and played like this Beethoven-esque track. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3150.74s)]
*  And I spat on it. It depends, but usually like it's either in person with a producer starting [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3160.02s)]
*  from scratch and I'm like a big part of the production process or I'm sending a sample and [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3166.58s)]
*  we're kind of, you know, going step by step. Soiree is the one that's like about 30 seconds in, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3170.42s)]
*  it kind of changes to a total, is that the one that flips to like a total different? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3174.8199999999997s)]
*  I think even with the intro, probably the intro, Isn't It Marvelous is the intro to my album, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3178.1s)]
*  which is like this like smooth 80s little funky John. And then it changes into like this hard [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3182.98s)]
*  trap beat and it keeps going back and forth. Soiree is the second song where it's like this organ [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3189.7799999999997s)]
*  playing that Dwayle played. And man, that one came out hot. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3194.9s)]
*  That's something that's interesting about you and I'm listening. It's like I can't, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3200.82s)]
*  it's like I'm in different time periods kind of, you know, it's almost like I'm just, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3203.54s)]
*  yeah, I feel like I'm just kind of traveling through joyful different moments in time and [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3207.46s)]
*  in music. It's kind of cool. I like to really mix it up and like have these beats be different. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3213.86s)]
*  Like I don't like having multiple songs on a project that are the same where a lot of artists, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3217.86s)]
*  it's like they have a style and all the beats are going to sound in a certain, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3222.02s)]
*  you know, range where all the beats are going to be similar, like a Playboy Cardi or like a [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3226.18s)]
*  little Uzi. Like their beats are all like in the same sort of style, but I like to like really [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3229.78s)]
*  mix it up. And like, I think, I think a lot of artists it's better for them to make a specific [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3234.18s)]
*  style that they rock with. But for me, it's like my voice, my, my lyrics, my, you know, sort of just [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3239.94s)]
*  style and, you know, regalia, all that. Yeah. Simon Rex, shout out. Yeah. Shots from Simon Rex, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3248.66s)]
*  all that kind of speaks for itself. And then beats, I just want to try new things every time. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3256.2599999999998s)]
*  What about BG dude? He might be somebody that'd be interesting. He's kind of been gone. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3263.54s)]
*  BG Knockout? No, like the BG, do you remember him? He was part of like, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3268.02s)]
*  I mean the BG's themselves are who I kind of based my style off of. Oh dang. So they had a [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3273.7s)]
*  rapper out in New Orleans called BG. And I know BG Knockout was from Compton, but I don't know [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3279.54s)]
*  about BG. Yeah, they had, can you bring him up, Zach? New Orleans, y'all did have some. Blink, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3284.66s)]
*  blink. He had that, every time he'd come around my city, bling, bling. I think it ring word about [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3291.78s)]
*  50 billion. I'm about it, man. Yeah. I don't see if no one. He was with little Wayne in the beginning. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3296.98s)]
*  They were, uh, bro, that early shit is so him juvenile, juvenile used to live in a neighborhood [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3301.06s)]

*  some women down the street with an ice pick. And then we all went out and bought his album [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3311.38s)]
*  fire, man. That's prime marketing right there. Oh dude, we were like, oh, we were buying ice picks [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3315.94s)]
*  and shit. People give each other ice picks like as a stock and stuffers, bro, New Orleans, y'all got [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3320.98s)]

*  don't want to collab with people, but like we've done enough shows together and stuff where I feel [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3357.2200000000003s)]
*  like it could happen pretty soon. Yeah. They're specific about their world, you know, they're [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3361.1400000000003s)]

*  Shakewell, me, Ramirez, uh, Jerm, uh, Turnstile. This was like last year. They just, they just did [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3391.38s)]
*  another one with ski mats, but this time I was like the, the schema. I was like the direct support [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3399.78s)]
*  and it was sick. Wow. So only a few shows, but they were, they wanted to have Chief Keef too, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3404.98s)]
*  but he didn't show up. Oh damn. That's that. Chief Keef is a great dude. Was there, is he? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3408.9s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. I've kicked it with him a lot. Always dude, like he doesn't talk a lot, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3414.5s)]
*  but anytime he says anything, it's really cool. And, and he's just a very giving person. And [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3419.14s)]
*  anytime I've asked him to get on a song, he just slays it. He's fire. Love Chief Keef. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3425.46s)]
*  Sway Lee is sick. That would be fire. I haven't met him, but I have a lot of mutual friends. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3431.06s)]
*  That's a good idea. Nicest dude, man. I got to meet him at the super bowl and his uncle is a comedian. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3435.14s)]
*  This guy's Sully McCullough. So I'd always like, I knew that they were out of Mississippi, so I'd [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3440.1s)]
*  always be talking to him about it and stuff like that. And like, I knew that, um, that he was [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3445.8599999999997s)]
*  related. And then I was at the super bowl and he was there and I was just so amped and he was [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3451.46s)]
*  literally the probably the nicest dude in the room. Just Sway Lee, just so cool. I mean, he's so, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3456.02s)]
*  everything about him is just, it seems really cool, you know, but, uh, but he was real, real [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3461.62s)]
*  friendly. Oh yeah. I love meeting people that are like really, really up and are still friendly, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3465.54s)]
*  you know? Yeah. It's hard to find some time. Yeah. I think it's like, I think that's about [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3470.8199999999997s)]
*  your energy. It's like people want to work with you cause they want to be around you too. You know, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3475.22s)]
*  I think that's probably a big aspect for people. Um, I actually ended up the last two years getting [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3478.8199999999997s)]
*  booked, uh, as the most, I was the most booked college artist the last two years. Really? Yeah. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3483.38s)]
*  So you've been playing colleges. I was the most booked artist at colleges the last two years. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3489.86s)]
*  And that's purely because we're professional. We pull up, we're really nice to everybody. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3493.2200000000003s)]
*  And so I did like, I think like 40 shows at colleges last year and about like 35 this year. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3498.5800000000004s)]
*  And are you going through NACA and stuff like that? Did you go to the, like, uh, through the [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3503.3s)]
*  conference? Like, is it specifically for the college or is it college town? It's, it's college. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3506.1800000000003s)]
*  It's like their actual like spring festival or like they're like fall festival. That's sick, dude. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3510.7400000000002s)]
*  That's a tough market to do on a lot of times. And it just worked out, man. There's a lot of my [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3516.1000000000004s)]
*  fans of these college girls. And then I meet the promoters who, who a lot of them will book for [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3519.54s)]
*  tons of different colleges. And like, if we get along well, it's like that, that's really important [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3523.94s)]
*  in music. And I think every industry is like, if you're just a good person and like not a dick and [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3528.02s)]
*  like, like do what they ask, like me, it's me and Waka Flocka are like the two like top. That's [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3532.2599999999998s)]
*  cause Waka Flocka is a great down to earth guy. Waka Flocka and I did a few shows together and [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3538.9s)]
*  he brought me aside and we meditated together. He's vegan. Oh, damn dude. He is like not what [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3544.58s)]
*  you'd expect. And it's awesome. Great down to earth fella, about my height, way stronger. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3551.22s)]
*  When you see people that are your height, do you think that you are, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3557.94s)]
*  is there a better chance you're going to be friends? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3562.42s)]
*  That's a really good question. I feel like there was like a little bit of a bonding with tall [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3566.42s)]
*  people, you know, some, some of them will, you know, instantly come in with like the, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3570.42s)]
*  the opposite feeling like, oh, like, oh, he's the other tall guy, you know, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3575.06s)]
*  like height beef kind of shit. Yeah. I think I can't remember. I'm at G easy and I think it [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3580.42s)]
*  might've been that way. I don't know. Anyways, most, most tall people, yeah, we have a little [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3585.78s)]
*  bit of a bond, you know, he'd DAP up and be like, Hey man, pleasure. You know, stay long, stay long [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3590.34s)]
*  bro. You long drink of water. Yeah. He's always has a lot of chicks. That's what I always hear. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3595.94s)]
*  You know? Yeah. He went to school in Loyola in New Orleans actually, which is kind of interesting. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3600.66s)]

*  just like, I don't know how we even met, but you guys remind me of each other. Actually the way [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3699.78s)]
*  that you kind of keep it tight. Yeah. He'll just kind of send a picture sometimes just something [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3703.54s)]
*  crazy, you know, what's up? Um, he has energy gets read wrong. I think sometimes about people, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3706.58s)]
*  because he just has such this, uh, you know, he's kind of gotten into podcasting and he's so much [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3711.54s)]
*  also like an artist outside of his fighting. Right. So I think a lot of fighters are initially, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3716.9s)]
*  it seemed like we're like, what the fuck is this dude doing? He's not a real fighter, you know, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3721.86s)]
*  because he's able to manage two different real businesses in a lot of ways. But man, he's, uh, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3725.54s)]
*  yeah, he's so good. His energy is always fun, man. His whole life. And he liked this the way [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3731.3s)]
*  he's able to just kind of record his life and he doesn't stress about it too much kind of. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3736.34s)]
*  Yeah. I often, uh, I, um, admire him. I admire his ability to not like kind of like get too [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3741.0600000000004s)]
*  overwhelmed or anything. I would get too spun up, you know, how do you feel about, uh, Jake Paul? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3747.94s)]
*  We talked about this on that BFS podcast. I don't, I mean, I met Jake just through his brother [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3753.0600000000004s)]
*  and I, and, you know, and I was, I was talking more with Logan and, and, and anytime I've ever [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3758.02s)]
*  been in the same space as those guys, but I think he's, he's serious about boxing. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3762.34s)]
*  I used to think the dude was so lame and he, I mean, way back, like, like I met him and he was [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3769.3s)]
*  pretty actually cool dude. And now like, I think he's undefeated against all these like professional [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3773.7s)]
*  fighters. Like, like, yeah, his marketing is douchey and he's got his own thing going, but like, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3780.18s)]
*  that's pretty bad ass, man. Like I got, I got to show love to him. Logan's a really good dude too. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3785.54s)]
*  I like Logan a lot. Logan is cool. I've interacted with him a lot more. Jake, it's like, you know, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3789.86s)]
*  I don't know if I'd be your friend, but I think you are a bad ass, my friend. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3795.46s)]
*  Jake seems tougher to get to know kind of, he seems like his own, he, he, like, you know, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3798.74s)]
*  he seemed like he kind of stays in his own world a bit. Logan's obviously just super busy, dude. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3804.34s)]
*  But yeah, he's always fun to, you know, always enjoy being around those guys and they crush it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3810.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just impressed. I think that both of them were considered like lame, like, like I just [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3814.5s)]
*  did not fuck with them at all. Just based on like what I'd heard, like I hadn't even like looked into [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3819.14s)]
*  it. And then they did the right moves to become kind of sick again. You know, they fought, they, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3822.5s)]
*  they literally tried fighting, which is like impressive. They trained from nothing [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3827.78s)]
*  and killed it. And, you know, like they're doing a lot of dope shit. So I got respect for those guys. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3832.58s)]
*  Well, you have to admire their commitment, the ability to kind of evolve, right? To make [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3838.34s)]
*  that choice to go from, you know, what people would call a YouTube star or YouTube fame, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3844.02s)]
*  which has got to be so like, I can't even imagine coming up on that being horrible. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3848.82s)]
*  Distracts all that is this trash, but then you come in and you find, I think they just found [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3853.86s)]
*  what they're meant to be, man, that fighting space. And then he went to that Japanese mistletoe [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3858.9s)]
*  thing or whatever, and they fucking rocked him about that for some reason. Like, what do you do? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3862.42s)]
*  I remember him filming a dead person hanging from a tree. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3867.7s)]
*  Now that's what you're probably thinking of. He went to the Japanese suicide forest. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3869.94s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't mistletoe. It was a dead man. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3874.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's the damn grim reapers mistletoe son. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3878.5s)]
*  I guess so, man. Hey, I still fuck with y'all fellas. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3882.18s)]
*  Yeah. And it's, yeah. I mean, a lot, yeah, nobody wants to be a part of suicide or anything. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3884.7400000000002s)]
*  I can't, but also in Japan, they don't have a lot of room to do stuff. I think. So I think they have [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3888.98s)]
*  to do things like in certain areas, there's not a lot of room there. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3893.54s)]
*  Interesting, like cultural. I talked to some psychiatrists about this, like, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3897.7799999999997s)]
*  it's interesting, like different countries have cultural, like views on suicide and stuff. And [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3901.22s)]
*  it's like, I think Japan has the highest rate of suicide because it's like, just kind of like [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3906.02s)]
*  part of their culture and like embedded in their, in their, in their, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3911.06s)]
*  embedded. Is that a term? Embedded, embedded. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3914.9s)]
*  I've seen it, dude. I'll tell you. Yeah. You know, the inbreds, I know the embed, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3918.5s)]
*  embedded in their brain. I've seen it. They got some square tits on. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3922.42s)]
*  Pull up the Japanese suicide. I would like to know a little bit more about it just so we can. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3926.34s)]
*  Yeah. So I have some clear. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3929.86s)]
*  Suicide forest. I've heard a lot about it. Anyways, Japan and like Russia and there's [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3931.38s)]
*  one other country where they have like just culturally, like they have like the suicide, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3936.34s)]
*  like statistics are crazy different than anywhere else. I think Russia in particular, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3940.5s)]
*  it's like a crazy amount. Okigara. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3945.78s)]
*  Yeah. It's this, it's this one here. It's just a heavily forest. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3948.1s)]
*  Okigara also known as the sea of trees is a forest on the Northwestern flank of Mount. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3952.5s)]
*  Who's on that one? Yeah. How many people do, how many people commit suicide? The people also ask it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3957.86s)]
*  30 every year. About 30 people committing suicide there every year. So for one place, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3963.7s)]
*  imagine if there was one park, you know. That's like, that's like more than one. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3969.3s)]
*  That's like three a month, man. That's crazy. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3972.98s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine being like the park ranger, you know, you're the park ranger and you just got to pull [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3976.82s)]
*  up and do like, oh, there's another. Yeah. Cause that's one every other week. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3981.3s)]
*  Yeah. And I wonder if there's like a busy season. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3984.98s)]
*  Guaranteed bro. Like when it's cold out and shit. It's a beautiful place too. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3989.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, maybe that's why too. I think that is, you know, it looks like it's such a beautiful place. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3994.6600000000003s)]
*  You and I saw this crazy Tik Tok the other night, a guy, a guy is trying to hang himself and a guy [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=3999.3s)]
*  walks up on him and is recording a video and like talks him out of it. And it's all video. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4006.34s)]
*  And the dude's like bawling, crying and stuff. Like, sometimes I'm like, is some of this on Tik [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4014.42s)]
*  Tok, is it even real? But this thing looked pretty real. That sounds real. That's like, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4019.46s)]
*  I think that'd be, there are people that fake some whack shit, but I feel like that'd be, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4022.6600000000003s)]
*  that'd be pretty fucking whack to fake that. Yeah. Can you see that? Is that do you, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4026.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't know how you would even look that up. I'm trying to find it. I'm trying. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4030.42s)]
*  And I know it's probably going to set off alarms even looking for it. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4032.9s)]
*  Wow. When did you start to feel like, okay, I'm turning a, I'm turning a corner here. So, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4036.7400000000002s)]

*  juvenile issues starting out, like out of the gate trouble in Georgia. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4049.06s)]
*  You can't, you know, but you have this vibe that everybody loves. You're doing music. When does it [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4055.3s)]
*  start to kind of turn for you and you realize, okay, I really have to lean into this or [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4060.98s)]
*  you just realize that it's getting bigger? Yeah. It was right at the end of my, my [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4066.9s)]
*  commune stay in Montana. I was just finishing up that probation. I had about a year left in college [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4071.54s)]
*  and I was working a lot. I was going crazy. I was so motivated that I was a full-time student, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4077.46s)]
*  18 credits at university of Wisconsin and Madison, Madison. Yeah. Gang baby. Yeah. I [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4082.66s)]
*  see you as a company on state before in there. Oh, I remember that's the first place I ever got [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4088.82s)]
*  kicked out of in my life. Yeah, man. Place is great. Anyways, I, uh, and it was doing that. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4092.6600000000003s)]
*  I was working 20 hours a week at this place that would have probably ended up being my job if it [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4098.1s)]
*  wasn't, you know, for the music stuff that popped up. And, uh, I had ran this pizza company with my [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4101.78s)]
*  homie. Basically the pizza roller, basically what we did for about almost two years, we bought like [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4108.02s)]
*  a souped up golf cart and we put this trailer on the back that was like this metal thing that [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4114.42s)]
*  kept things warm. Pardon me with the local pizza chain and what was it called? Uh, not, not, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4119.46s)]
*  I was about to say Fazoli's. No, it was a great pizza place. Fabian's or something. I don't know. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4127.54s)]
*  It was, it wasn't the best pizza in town, but it was like, we would hire kids to drive this thing [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4132.18s)]
*  around, play music, put lights on it, and they would sell pizza by the slice to the drunk kids [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4136.82s)]
*  at little bars. So we do it, we do it four nights a week. They go out there from like 9 PM till 3 AM [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4141.54s)]
*  and just sell pizza at all the drunkenness. Yeah. And that was like, that was like my first business [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=4147.54s)]

*  probably just even just spending more time at peace or relaxing or just sitting there, my dad [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5004.0199999999995s)]

*  He was just old. People get older. Yeah, absolutely. Wait, so how old was he when he passed? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5014.099999999999s)]

*  just went for a walk. Hit his head. It was the middle of the winter. He slipped on the ice, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5027.22s)]
*  hit his head and like didn't realize it until like five hours later, but he had like internal brain [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5033.0599999999995s)]
*  bleeding and he started having a bad reaction. This looked up because I was at my homie's house [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5037.94s)]
*  and we were like smoking and just chilling. And I got a call from my mom, like, yo, dad's in the [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5041.38s)]

*  No, it was, it was bad timing. I think right when I got there, he had just like reached the point of [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5088.259999999999s)]

*  Somalians, those were like the three small hands, Somalians, a lot of them in Minnesota. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5310.98s)]
*  I was like, damn small hands. I want to see these motherfuckers. Those are my boys. So it was like, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5316.339999999999s)]
*  those were like the three groups of like the dudes within my hometown. There's four high schools, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5322.099999999999s)]
*  but like still it was kind of like split, uh, skater stoners, Hicks that like drove trucks, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5326.259999999999s)]
*  forced it to a boost. And then the small hands, which were like, well, we, I mean, not just [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5331.7s)]
*  small, you know, it was the Vietnamese, everybody, but everyone kind of had their little like crews. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5335.78s)]
*  Uh, then there was just, all the girls were kind of like free game, like, like all over, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5339.78s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? Uh, where was I even going with this? You were saying when I was growing [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5344.66s)]
*  up, there was three types of people and I was like, Oh, do you know anything about, um, sit? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5348.82s)]
*  No, not sit. Yeah. It was like, did you have game in high school? Oh, did I have game? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5354.179999999999s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Sorry. The whole thing is, uh, all my friends and my little skate skater crew were [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5357.62s)]
*  handsome motherfuckers and they're really good at skateboarding. And I wasn't that good at [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5363.7s)]
*  skateboarding and I was kind of ugly, skinny, had acne and shit. So I had to develop game [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5366.74s)]
*  in order to wheel on the same women that all my peers were wheeling on. You know what I'm saying? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5372.099999999999s)]
*  So I had to develop game early and, uh, did I used to just like go out solo and like go to like, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5376.82s)]
*  dude, I was like 15 or 16 and I would just go out to like, either like a bar and like find my way [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5384.9s)]
*  in or like go wherever and just like. Meet women. Sober and just like meet and like see, like try [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5388.9s)]
*  to train myself, you know? And then I finally got that game and like I had some really hot [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5394.26s)]
*  girlfriends in high school that made me look ugly as shit. Cause I was dusty and I never really [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5398.820000000001s)]
*  like came up and like, I kind of grew into my body when I was in college and like, you know, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5405.14s)]
*  got the facial hair and like became like a normal looking dude. I wasn't like, I wasn't like a [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5409.22s)]
*  fucking little trash can man, but I was definitely a little dusty. I guess you kind of look like [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5413.3s)]
*  almost like George Washington's fine son. Oh, I'll take that man. Shit. Let's go. Okay. Thank you, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5418.58s)]
*  sir. So, uh, so yeah, man, I developed game early on and I think that that sort of confidence and [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5424.58s)]
*  charisma carried into my music and helped a lot with like just even like any risks I was taking. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5430.58s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta be, yeah, you have to be really confident up there to do that. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5437.46s)]
*  It's interesting watching somebody. It's funny watching somebody else do their art. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5442.42s)]
*  You can't even believe that you do anything that's even remotely similar to it. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5447.38s)]
*  Yeah, just that different. Yeah. Like I was up there with Trevor the other night watching. We're [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5451.139999999999s)]
*  like, dude, we should have freaking done music, dude. We're so pissed at ourselves. Cause it just, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5454.74s)]
*  there's such a different energy. Like with comedy, it's just like, Hey, you're almost just like, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5459.62s)]
*  Hey, don't you wish I could do music? You know, it's almost like you just wish you could, you know? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5464.42s)]
*  But it's funny watching somebody else perform. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like you do [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5470.98s)]
*  anything similar to that. Yeah. I remember the, I think I've been on your shows, but I've been a [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5474.02s)]
*  few Trevor's and uh, I mean, I, I, I get so impressed with last one. I was at Chris Della came out, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5478.660000000001s)]
*  Anthony Jess and it came out and uh, Mark Hayes and man, dude, it was just the, the, uh, what's [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5486.34s)]
*  the word? Just the improv levels were insane, man. I was like, I'm very impressed. I feel like [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5493.06s)]
*  anyone who does comedy, am I wrong in thinking that anyone who does comedy would be really good [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5498.26s)]
*  at acting? I don't know. You could slay that shit. Yeah. I think acting is just a lot more like even [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5502.02s)]
*  I did a part in a movie recently with Bobby Lee. It was a friend of mine's movie. This guy, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5507.860000000001s)]
*  Laj. It's about a sober living and we did do some parts in it and even watching back, watching [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5512.34s)]
*  some of it back, I'm like, Oh, acting, you don't move at all. Like even like, I didn't think I was [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5518.42s)]
*  moving much like when I was recording, but I was like, Oh damn, there's some parts where I'm even [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5524.26s)]
*  moving too much. Like you, like acting is like, you're not doing anything, bro. I mean, you're [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5528.74s)]
*  getting the message across, but that's all you're doing. You know? Um, I probably tried some acting [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5533.7s)]
*  with comedy central recently. That's it was actually a lot of fun. I saw, what was it? Uh, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5538.9s)]
*  I did like four little sketches with them. There was one I saw that was, I think it was for P it [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5542.82s)]
*  was with pizza hut. Maybe you're some pizza. I did some pizza hut too. It was good. I did with [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5546.42s)]
*  common sense. Well, I did one. It was like a, it was like a polyamorous rom-com. And then there was [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5551.46s)]
*  one about me being a human taxidermist. Uh, one about me meeting God and we're about to drop this [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5556.1s)]
*  one called, uh, yeah, that's just funny. Oh, I nutted on DMT that one. Yeah. No, that's another [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5561.700000000001s)]
*  good one though. Uh, we, I just got the final cut of this one called, uh, clot ones. I think I can [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5567.9400000000005s)]
*  reveal like the plot. It's like hot ones, but they, they hooked me up to a menstrual cramp simulator [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5573.860000000001s)]
*  and like throwing blood at me. It was, it was lit. It's probably going dark over there. Yeah. No, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5578.58s)]
*  I was, the whole thing was funny, man. Comedy central is dope. Uh, I had fun. I had fun doing [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5583.14s)]
*  a little bit of acting, man. Yeah. I want to more of that. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's, I mean, I, I'm [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5588.34s)]
*  not, it's like, you're, you're kind of like this, you're just kind of this energy, this force. And [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5592.58s)]
*  I think people want to be around it. Um, anything else in the news, Zach? I'm trying to give. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5597.22s)]
*  Uh, we need a lot of news. I got a kind of a crazy video of these guys slapping each other at an IHOP. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5603.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, sure. So what, uh, Oh, take me, take me through. So like you do like sampling a lot [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5608.9800000000005s)]
*  of your music. You find things you like from the past. What's that? What is that like? Uh, what are [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5616.1s)]
*  like, can you just do that? Take me through some of that. That's complicated. Uh, legally you got to [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5621.780000000001s)]
*  like clear everything. And since my lyrics are very not friendly, especially for like these older [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5628.5s)]
*  songs where it's the estate or it's someone older who's listening to it. A lot of times they don't [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5634.98s)]
*  like hip hop. So trying to just sort of clear something doesn't work often. A lot of times [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5639.139999999999s)]
*  we'll just bring ideas into the studio and then kind of recreate or make something similar and [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5645.86s)]
*  that works easier. It's like, it's annoying. So I finally found producers that can just make their [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5650.0199999999995s)]
*  own shit off the top, which is dope, but yeah, it's, it's annoying. What is it? So say if you do [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5655.459999999999s)]
*  use a song, do you have to, if you do want to use something, do you have to reach out to them first? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5660.259999999999s)]
*  How does that kind of work? I didn't at first when I was starting on song cloud and all that, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5664.66s)]
*  a lot of my songs, I blew up really big. I didn't, cause I didn't even know how I didn't have, I didn't [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5669.22s)]
*  have any, you know, legal folks to help me with it. And I, uh, I just said, you know what they can [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5673.62s)]
*  only sue me for as much as I made off the song. So it's worth it because, you know, I'll still get [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5681.3s)]
*  whatever attention I need off of it or whatever. Uh, the only actual time that I've had to like [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5687.7s)]
*  take a song fully down and like give all the money away was George Michael's estate with a [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5692.9s)]
*  sampled Kiosk whisper. I'm signing the check this week for the one 90 K. But besides that, it's like, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5698.099999999999s)]
*  wow, cool. So they asked for one 90 or was it negotiated? How does you have like an announcement [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5704.58s)]
*  that was just all the, like they had to like get reports. That was how much money I made on the [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5709.379999999999s)]
*  song. That's a good, that's kind of a deep cut too. So I was, I was impressed that they like figured [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5712.74s)]
*  all that out, but I got to pay them that. Um, everybody else like, we'll just, you know, they'll [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5716.66s)]
*  take a little check and they'll take like some, some publishing on the song. It's like a percentage, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5720.98s)]
*  but it's usually pretty cool about it. Uh, and nowadays now that I'm signed and everything, I, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5725.139999999999s)]
*  I can't like, I have to go through the full process. Yeah. Is it almost kind of a bummer? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5729.459999999999s)]
*  It's like, once you get the popular, once you kind of get to some levels of achievement, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5734.0199999999995s)]
*  you then have to do. It messes up my style. A lot of like sort of the staples of my style, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5738.5s)]
*  I can't do anymore. Then I have to like, try to recreate in other ways, which I found ways to do, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5744.82s)]
*  which is like, you know, little like old school samples and stuff. I can make my own, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5748.98s)]
*  I can make my own sample, like full on, uh, samples from scratch, like a full song, but like, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5752.98s)]
*  it's not, you know, it's not quite the same, but, but I've, I figured out ways to make it work. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5760.74s)]
*  So is that like, say, so there's somebody who's wanting to sample stuff. They like sample and [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5764.419999999999s)]
*  they're trying to figure it out for themselves, but they're afraid to put their music out there. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5768.099999999999s)]
*  They're like a new artist, right? Would you just tell them to do it? Yeah. Yeah. If you're early, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5770.82s)]
*  do it. It's worth it, man. I, I didn't have to deal with any of it until like, I mean, I think [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5774.98s)]
*  once my songs were getting more than like 30 million streams, like that was when people [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5780.82s)]
*  started noticing it. It's like before that they're not going to, if it's something old, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5785.62s)]
*  at least they're not going to notice. And if you do it right, like, and they like the song, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5788.66s)]
*  they're most likely getting to clear it out of like 10 different situations I had. Only one of [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5795.0599999999995s)]
*  them ended up really bad. So I'd say do it. I'd say do it. If you want to sample something, do it. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5800.339999999999s)]
*  It's worth the, worth the trial. You got arrested. You said a couple of times, what was one of the, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5804.98s)]
*  take me through one of those issues? Yeah. So, you know, I've told a lot of these stories, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5811.54s)]
*  but I guess I haven't really delved fully into the, the, the third, which was, I'm going to say [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5815.219999999999s)]
*  December, 2019, maybe it wasn't that long ago. I was, it was right before Christmas and I was [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5820.98s)]
*  drunk in Atlanta and I wanted to go get some food. Right. My whole crew, that was, we were in Buckhead, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5828.82s)]
*  my whole crew, that was with me. They didn't want to go get any food. So then I met this random fella, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfjD1awM7hQ&t=5836.179999999999s)]
