# Sand Hands  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #546
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ)
*  All right. Good day. Good day. Um, how are you? How are you? How are I? How are, how are us? Um, good to see everyone. Good to be here with you. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy November. Happy existence. You know, that's something as well. Um, this year went, baby. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This year, that thing is, this year was just hooked to a dang laser beam. I feel like, what was that? You almost had to slow down the film and even remember the summer. It was just, just, this thing was just a, this took the HOV lane this year. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=29.72s)]
*  Life got roller skates on. Damn it. Life's got just roller skates on. What was that? I couldn't even, I couldn't even make an accurate police report on, on, on, on April. I couldn't tell you what she looked like, what she was wearing. The officer was like, well, can you tell me April, tell me, you know, how tall? I don't know. Damn it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=53.24s)]
*  It just all went so fast. You know, and I don't know if it's just that life feels faster now, but you can't even get your hands on it. I mean, it's like just trying to grab sand. You can get some of it, but then it just, it ends up just, you just, you just realize and you can't get it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=81.24s)]
*  You can't get that grip on it, boy. It's like trying to just do a, um, uh, what's it called? The guy you go to and you go in his shop or whatever. And it's, he pretends like he has a secretary or whatever, but he doesn't. And then you go in there and he lays you down. And he like, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=111.24s)]
*  he like, he asked you like a question or something, but you're so nervous that you're going to get touched or whatever. But what is that? Dang it. Um, chiropractor. It's like trying to be a chiropractor on sand. You know, you just, you can't move it. You can't control. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=131.24s)]
*  You just, you think you can. And then there's nothing. Um, anyway, I'm rambling. I'm just saying it's been a long year. Um, and I'm happy to be here with you today. And, uh, yeah, just thank you guys for just your patience on doing solo episodes. I wanted to tape this yesterday, but I just, my, I was just so damn rattled. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=154.24s)]
*  You ever wake up and you're just damn rattled. I mean, it's just like a couple of pigeons are just living in your ass. You're just like, what in the hell? And everything's a prop. Somebody, you know, somebody comes to the door and they just, you know, this guy came to the door and he was offering pest control or whatever. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=177.24s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, I, I think they just came because I think I have like 11 pest control guys because I, you know, I forget. And then next thing, you know, hell I'll be in my living room reading a book and one of them will just, damn just, we'll just spray for, we'll just spray for lice right in front of me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=201.24s)]
*  He'll spray for lice right across my damn forehead sometimes. Cause I forget, you know, I always forget when they're going to be here. You have that one afternoon, you're doing a cook off and they show up with those, um, with those, uh, those, uh, chigger grenades or whatever. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=218.24s)]
*  And they're humming those bitches, you know, when your family's out there, you're trying to put mustard on something and the baby's got damn bug gas in his eyes. It's just, I just forget. Anyway, the guy came and, um, he had just, uh, the bug guy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=237.24s)]
*  He's like, you know, we can come, we can come 17 times a year. That's what he said. And I was like, dude, I don't want, when I get married, I don't want my wife coming here 17 times a year. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=257.24s)]
*  You know, so that's not a sales tactic. I wanted to hear, but, uh, but the guy had the biggest mustache I'd ever seen in my life. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=267.24s)]
*  And the only thing I could think the whole time he's talking to me is you need to go spray up in that bitch. Cause there ain't, there is not a chance in hell. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=279.24s)]
*  You're not running some kind of damn bug motel right up under your snout, daddy. There ain't a CNH baby, chance in hell. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=292.24s)]
*  You ain't got a couple of fucking word lice running around up in that, uh, in that up in that trap house. You got above your lip, daddy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=304.24s)]
*  So it just, you know, I said, I said, I think I work good. You know, we got guys, I got seven guys spraying right now. You know, I could barely talk to the guy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=316.24s)]
*  Some guy was spraying right in front of me. Um, but yeah, just everything's happened so far. I just get confused. Everything's happened so fast. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=326.24s)]
*  And, um, and here we are and it's November and it's, it's like that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=335.24s)]
*  And I'm sure it's like that for everybody. It's like, okay. Some of you, your kid is a, you know, your kid is age is been a is aged this year. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=346.24s)]
*  I'm like, man, I can't believe it. You know, Genevieve's four now or your dad is it got to get a hip, got to get a new hip or new neck or whatever. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=356.24s)]
*  You're like, now it's already time next week. Ricky's getting that new neck. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=369.24s)]
*  You know, it's just things happen fast. You know, man, it was only seven months ago that, uh, we laid my grandmother to rest. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=377.24s)]
*  You know, just, it's just all these things and life just keeps life and, you know, and it's just, um, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=388.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. It's a lot for everybody. And it's marvelous at the same time. It is existence. That's what it is. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=396.24s)]
*  Um, but I'm grateful to be here with you guys today and, uh, just grateful to be taking a moment to think about our lives and what they've been like. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=403.24s)]
*  I, uh, I want to say thanks. We, it has been a while since we've had a solo episode. I'm still going to try to do more. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=413.24s)]
*  Um, I'm finally having a little more time to start to take care of myself right now. And so that's feeling really good just to be able to relax. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=422.24s)]
*  Um, what's going on? We had some shows in a lot of places. Thank you guys. It came out out there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=431.24s)]

*  I don't know, I can't even explain it to you. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=623.24s)]
*  You know, I definitely did my best, but they gave you oxygen tanks. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=626.24s)]
*  But all the oxygen tank is just a can of just more dry. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=630.24s)]
*  You hit that bitch and now you're just... [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=636.24s)]
*  Everything, even the animals, they would sound like they were dried out. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=641.24s)]

*  But he was so dry. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=659.24s)]
*  So that was just a... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=663.24s)]
*  But beautiful country, beautiful place. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=664.24s)]
*  I just... [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=666.24s)]
*  I was shocked at how dehydrated I got IVs up there. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=667.24s)]
*  It just took me a little bit to get on my feet, man. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=671.24s)]
*  It was a lot. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=673.24s)]
*  That was like probably one of the more hectic times that I'd had this year. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=674.24s)]
*  Just healthness, you know? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=679.24s)]
*  And being alive and being like that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=682.24s)]
*  I went out to Montana, but all that area, Colorado Springs, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=686.24s)]
*  and thank you for everybody coming out, and Casper. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=690.24s)]
*  I can't even believe it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=695.24s)]
*  I mean, Montana, wow, all of those regions. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=697.24s)]
*  I mean, that's where Mother Nature just tries on her clothes up there, baby. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=702.24s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=708.24s)]
*  Everything you see is beautiful. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=710.24s)]
*  You know, it's just remarkable. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=713.24s)]
*  So to even get to go to that part of the country that people came out, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=716.24s)]
*  thank you guys so much, to all the places that we went, man. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=719.24s)]
*  I got to go to La Crosse, Wisconsin. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=724.24s)]
*  And it's one of the greatest little city town places I've been. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=729.24s)]
*  I didn't, man, you always, I think of some people in your head, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=737.24s)]
*  you have ideas of a place that's kind of perfect, you know? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=741.24s)]
*  And they got, you know, somebody's walking their kid home from school or whatever, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=746.24s)]
*  and the kid's just got a bunch of snot on his face or whatever, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=751.24s)]
*  and the parent leaves it, just because there's something kind of beautiful about it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=755.24s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=762.24s)]
*  Especially when you were poor, dude, if your nose was running, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=763.24s)]
*  I'd let that bitch fly, cut. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=766.24s)]
*  Because people were always looking at you when you were poor, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=771.24s)]

*  It's going to get brisk out. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=854.24s)]
*  What else has been going on? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=856.24s)]
*  Oh, I'll tell you, you know, something that I thought was really special, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=859.24s)]
*  is I got to be around or be a part of, or be around, really. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=862.24s)]
*  So SNL Saturday Night Live was going on, and Bill Burr was going to be on it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=868.24s)]
*  And Bill Burr is, there's nobody like him. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=874.24s)]
*  I mean, there's nobody like him. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=878.24s)]
*  He is himself, and he is one of one. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=881.24s)]
*  And I wanted to go see it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=885.24s)]
*  I'd never been to SNL. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=887.24s)]
*  I'd never been over there and seen it, you know? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=889.24s)]
*  And so myself, who came with me? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=893.24s)]
*  Oh, my buddy Kevin and John Farley was there. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=896.24s)]
*  And that's Chris Farley's brother. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=901.24s)]
*  And it was just like, man, to be at SNL, you know, where Chris Farley and Spade and Neelan and Carvey [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=904.24s)]
*  and all of the, like, Rock, Sam, just all these wizards of, you know, possibility, you know? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=912.24s)]
*  Sherry O'Terry, who's the lady that puts her, she's always taking her own temperature or whatever and smelling it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=923.24s)]
*  Who's that lady? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=935.24s)]
*  Her. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=938.24s)]
*  She, you know, just to be at SNL, Saturday Night Live, to be on that stage, just to be there watching. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=939.24s)]
*  And John Farley was there, Chris Farley's brother. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=946.24s)]
*  And it was the first time he said that he'd been back there since he'd been there with Chris. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=949.24s)]
*  And that was just, I don't know, it was just like, it just, it was just kind of, it felt special, you know? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=959.24s)]
*  Because I just can't imagine, I can't imagine having a brother that is, you know, so, well, first of all, it's your brother. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=968.24s)]
*  So they're very important to you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=976.24s)]
*  But then also they're such an entertainer. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=978.24s)]
*  And then you go back to the place where they, one of the places that they're most known from, you know? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=982.24s)]
*  And yeah, that was just, it was magnificent, man, just to be able to be there with him. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=988.24s)]
*  And he told so many stories. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=993.24s)]
*  And I was kind of bummed that they didn't bring him out on the stage and let him tell a story out there at SNL. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=996.24s)]
*  The stories he was telling backstage were better than half of the things that were happening on the tube, I thought. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1002.24s)]
*  I mean, but also that's, you know, I mean, it was just crazy to hear a guy talk about, you know, his brother, Chris Farley, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1010.24s)]
*  and all these little moments that they'd had backstage, and just these funny things. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1019.24s)]
*  And here I'll say this, when it came down to listening to him or watching some of the sketches, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1023.24s)]
*  I couldn't help but listen to some of the things that he was saying. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1029.24s)]
*  Because it was, yeah, it just was like walking through time and walking through time that really meant something, you know, time between brothers. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1033.24s)]
*  And so, yeah, that was pretty exceptional. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1044.24s)]
*  But yeah, I was like, SNL should have had him out there. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1046.24s)]
*  Like bring this guy, this is the first time he's been back since his brother. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1049.24s)]
*  It's like the closest Chris Farley will get to being there. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1053.24s)]
*  And yeah, it was just, I don't know. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1057.24s)]
*  So, but that was, it was great. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1061.24s)]
*  I'm not trying to tell you, you know, I don't know, I'm not talking too much or whatever. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1063.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1066.24s)]
*  But yeah, that was just, that was something neat to be a part of. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1068.24s)]
*  And what else? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1071.24s)]
*  I went with my friend has a son. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1073.24s)]
*  And, and we took him to the swing set. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1076.24s)]
*  And then what else is going on? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1079.24s)]
*  Oh, I watched the CMAs, Country Music Awards the other night, because I'm, you know, I live in Nashville. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1082.24s)]
*  And so you have to watch it or you people won't look you in the eyes for the for the next year. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1088.24s)]
*  And so, you know, I was checking it out and Caleb Presley was on there doing presentation. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1096.24s)]
*  Lainey Wilson was on there. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1104.24s)]
*  So it's like, you know, I got a peep, but I wanted to see if Jesse Murph was going to be there. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1107.24s)]
*  Jelly Roll was there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1111.24s)]
*  That whole gang, baby, Jelly Roll, Yellow Wolf. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1113.24s)]
*  I think they had damn Jelly Wolf there. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1116.24s)]
*  And it's just that that is just a St. Bernard with a couple of face tats on it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1118.24s)]
*  But that whole like musically recovering honky vibe, you know, that's really powerful. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1123.24s)]
*  And Yellow Roll, I saw damn Yellow Roll. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1129.24s)]
*  And it was Bobby Lee was there. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1132.24s)]
*  So it's just, you know, yeah, he's doing music now. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1137.24s)]
*  So it's just, you know, it's just there's anyway, it was a very diverse group over there. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1139.24s)]
*  And what am I talking about? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1143.24s)]
*  Oh, but I watched because I wanted to see if Red Clay Stray's were going to win. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1148.24s)]
*  They were up for vocal group, which what does that even mean? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1154.24s)]
*  Kind of it's all music, you know, but they didn't win. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1158.24s)]
*  Old Dominion won it, right? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1163.24s)]
*  And Dominion, no disrespect, right? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1168.24s)]
*  I haven't heard a lot. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1171.24s)]
*  You know, I don't think first of all, if you look at Old Dominion, they Dominion is a brother's name. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1172.24s)]
*  And it's, you know, show me 30 Dominions and I'll show you, you know, how to get how to get to Memphis. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1183.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, bro? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1193.24s)]
*  It's like, let's be realistic, baby. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1194.24s)]
*  That's Elvis's neighbors, homie. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1197.24s)]
*  OK, so and so that was the way I'm like, damn, they don't even somebody's hiding. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1200.24s)]
*  They're hiding. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1205.24s)]
*  They're hiding a brother amongst the four or five of the guys that they have in the group or whatever. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1206.24s)]
*  But yeah, I just wanted to see Ray Clay Stray's win. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1211.24s)]
*  And I thought it was just a chance for, you know, see, you may like to hear you have a vibe, you know, no disrespect to to O.D., baby. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1215.24s)]
*  But you have a vibe. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1226.24s)]
*  Ray Clay Stray's, they they sing, they sing prayers, man. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1227.24s)]
*  They sing things that I can't they sing prayers that I can't even make. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1232.24s)]
*  That I can't even make the words who they sing those. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1239.24s)]
*  And I just feel like that's part of such a movement. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1242.24s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think I really wanted them to win that award. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1244.24s)]
*  But also, then, Ray Clay Stray's, are they a country group? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1250.24s)]
*  And you could argue that it's all of it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1256.24s)]
*  Are they gospel? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1260.24s)]
*  You know, I mean, their music and it doesn't need a space to fit in, you know. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1264.24s)]
*  You don't need to put every foot in a shoe, but it's like, well, yeah, what are they? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1268.24s)]
*  But it's a lot of it's a lot of vibrant prayer. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1275.24s)]
*  I feel like coming out of those boys and I'm partisan as well or partisan or whatever. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1281.24s)]
*  Anyway, that's some of the stuff that's been going on recently and a lot more. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1287.24s)]
*  Some of it I can't remember. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1294.24s)]
*  But yeah, just see, I felt like they had a chance to pull some new blood in there. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1296.24s)]
*  And I just didn't see that, you know, but what do I know? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1301.24s)]
*  I don't know shit. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1309.24s)]
*  You know, I'm just a loud honky over. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1311.24s)]
*  That's all I am. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1313.24s)]
*  What else? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1315.24s)]
*  Grand Rapids, beautiful place. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1317.24s)]
*  Beautiful place, man. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1319.24s)]
*  Just yeah, just to see a lot of places where people are just thriving and people are saying, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1321.24s)]
*  hey, this is our community and we're going to keep it like it is, man. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1326.24s)]
*  That's something that that really felt great to witness. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1329.24s)]
*  Well, now it's that holiday season. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1334.24s)]
*  It's time for family and food. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1337.24s)]
*  And let's be honest, a little bit of chaos. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1339.24s)]
*  But hopefully the most chaotic thing that happens this year is you slurping down a little bit of oyster dressing. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1343.24s)]
*  However, if things don't go as planned, like a holiday mishap that leaves you seriously hurt, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1349.24s)]

*  You know, so if you want to get more Asian friends, you might want to do a Asian people like hide and go seek. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1817.24s)]
*  That's easy, man. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1826.24s)]
*  You know, and that's why I'm doing this. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1828.24s)]

*  I'll go hide because Asians got that clock in them, dog. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1850.24s)]
*  So that's something you could do to meet some Asians right there, man. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1862.24s)]
*  And also, it's OK to be a white guy that has black friends. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1866.24s)]
*  That's you know, and I know you're not saying there's anything wrong with it, but you know, they had and when I was you know, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=1869.24s)]

*  Hey, Michael. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2256.24s)]
*  I just want to say I've been thinking about turkey and ham. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2257.24s)]
*  We didn't have ham at Thanksgiving because apparently, you know, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2260.24s)]
*  ham's a Christmas thing. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2264.24s)]
*  And I love honey ham. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2266.24s)]
*  And all they have is turkey. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2268.24s)]
*  Turkey's dry and bland as shit. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2270.24s)]
*  No honey. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2272.24s)]
*  So I didn't fuck with it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2274.24s)]
*  So I just want your opinion. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2276.24s)]
*  OK, brother, I see you there. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2278.24s)]
*  I see you having a lot of feelings about it. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2280.24s)]
*  Yeah, turkey or ham. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2282.24s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2284.24s)]
*  Well, ham, ham. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2286.24s)]
*  Ham is ham. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2288.24s)]
*  Ham is ham. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2290.24s)]
*  You know, ham, it just it gets home and it's like, where's your mother? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2292.24s)]
*  You know, that's ham. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2297.24s)]
*  But turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey is a little more risky. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2299.24s)]
*  I think, you know, it's a little more perverted. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2307.24s)]
*  I think low key, bro. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2311.24s)]
*  Turkey, you know, it's like what you want to do to me. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2313.24s)]
*  Want to put me in a sandwich, want to put me in the fridge. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2318.24s)]
*  You want me now, you want me left over. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2323.24s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2327.24s)]
*  So turkey kind of looking at you like that, I feel like. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2330.24s)]
*  Ham looks like it's been smoking or whatever. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2335.24s)]
*  Like, all right. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2338.24s)]
*  You know, it'll party, but it's fucking, you know, you know, you know, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2340.24s)]
*  it's going to it can't it won't be able to drive itself home. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2345.24s)]
*  I am, you know. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2348.24s)]
*  But because it drinks ham drinks ham drinks. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2350.24s)]

*  Yo, Theo, Harley from Portland, Oregon, man. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2431.24s)]
*  What's up, Harley? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2434.24s)]
*  And I had a great time up there. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2436.24s)]
*  We did a shot there in Portland, which is a great city. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2437.24s)]
*  Let me say that people are always like there's an Tifa's up there. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2441.24s)]
*  You know, you know, LARP and in the park. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2446.24s)]
*  It's just a bunch of leftover and Tifa and BLM activists and people, you know, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2451.24s)]
*  adults wearing baby diapers up there, LARP and in the park and sword fighting [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2456.24s)]
*  and doing makeshift Renaissance fairs up there and shit and damn George Foreman [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2461.24s)]
*  grilling every meal and shit. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2466.24s)]
*  But I thought it was an amazing city. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2469.24s)]
*  I never I just hadn't it was just it really shocked me how special it was. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2472.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's naked guy pushing him, you know, pushing himself in a, you know, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2477.24s)]
*  and he's like, you know, has a boat or and he's going down the street and a [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2483.24s)]
*  a adult baby carriage or whatever. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2489.24s)]
*  But it's there's it's awesome. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2493.24s)]
*  I thought it was really, really groovy. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2497.24s)]
*  I really like Portland, Oregon. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2499.24s)]
*  What do you have to say, brother? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2502.24s)]
*  Sorry, I interrupted you there. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2503.24s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2504.24s)]
*  I really appreciate the way that that you peddle your ticket, the way that you [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2505.24s)]
*  encourage people to not use second hand sites because, you know, you don't want to [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2512.24s)]
*  you don't want people paying more than they should to come see you. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2517.24s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2520.24s)]
*  And I really respect that. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2521.24s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2522.24s)]
*  Well, a lot of times what happens is people will look up a ticket, right? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2523.24s)]
*  Want to go to the show, this city, this date or whatever, and then other [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2526.24s)]
*  secondary sites that are reselling tickets will put them will pay more to get [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2531.24s)]
*  their searching higher on Google and stuff like that. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2537.24s)]
*  And so then you click there and you're not really paying in a rigid. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2541.24s)]
*  You don't even have an option at a regular price ticket if there's still any [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2544.24s)]
*  available onward. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2548.24s)]
*  But then I go to your website, man, and I see that theovon.com slash tour is [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2549.24s)]
*  redirected to Ticketmaster. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2555.24s)]
*  And I'm just curious, man. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2558.24s)]
*  You know, the people absolutely hate Ticketmaster. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2560.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2563.24s)]
*  And I'm one of the people, brother. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2564.24s)]
*  I hate them. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2565.24s)]
*  I hate them. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2566.24s)]
*  It's just they've been running this scam forever. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2567.24s)]
*  So I don't know how we get a politician that is going to break up the monopoly [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2570.24s)]
*  that's very obvious. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2576.24s)]
*  I don't know how you get that done. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2577.24s)]
*  You know, I would love to have a ticket broker on this year. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2579.24s)]
*  Maybe we can find start delving into the dark depths of all that. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2582.24s)]
*  Because, yes, it's a monopoly. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2586.24s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2587.24s)]
*  It's sick that you could take three of your friends to a show, but now you can [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2588.24s)]
*  only take one because the fees are astronomical. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2592.24s)]
*  We don't see any money from the fees. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2595.24s)]
*  Artists don't. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2598.24s)]
*  You know, it's just the same people. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2599.24s)]
*  It's these big companies. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2601.24s)]
*  Who owns Ticketmaster? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2603.24s)]
*  You look that up for me. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2604.24s)]
*  I'm not going to get into that. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2605.24s)]
*  I'm not going to get into that. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2607.24s)]
*  I'm not going to get into that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2609.24s)]
*  I'm not going to get into that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2611.24s)]
*  Live Nation Entertainment. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2613.24s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2619.24s)]
*  Ticketmaster is a wholly owned subsidiary of Live Nation, which is headquartered in [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2620.24s)]
*  Beverly Hills. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2625.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think one of the issues, who's the owner of Live Nation, I wonder? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2626.24s)]
*  Vanguard. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2632.24s)]
*  Well, here's, this is hilarious. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2636.24s)]
*  Zoom in on this a little bit. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2640.24s)]
*  Liberty Media Corporation is the largest shareholder of Live Nation Entertainment, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2643.24s)]
*  owning 30% of the company. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2647.24s)]
*  Other major shareholders include Vanguard, owns 8.3%. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2649.24s)]
*  Black Rock Advisors owns 5.5%. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2653.24s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2657.24s)]
*  It's a whole lot of money. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2660.24s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2662.24s)]
*  It's the same people that own everything. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2665.24s)]
*  So that's why you're getting fucked because they own everything. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2667.24s)]
*  They own the building that the show is in sometimes, and then they own the website. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2670.24s)]
*  And they don't care. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2676.24s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2678.24s)]
*  That's the bottom line. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2680.24s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2683.24s)]
*  They don't care that it takes more money out of your pocket. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2684.24s)]
*  And mine, if I buy tickets somewhere, they don't care. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2688.24s)]
*  They want money. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2693.24s)]
*  That's all they want. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2696.24s)]
*  So yeah, that shit hurts my heart, man. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2699.24s)]
*  Nothing I can do about it, man. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2701.24s)]
*  You know, and maybe one day there'll be a better way to do it. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2703.24s)]
*  I know Zach Bryan tried a unique method through AXS, I think, ticketing, but it hasn't shown up yet [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2706.24s)]
*  or a way that's definitely definitively saves people that money. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2715.24s)]
*  But yeah, those people are robbing people. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2720.24s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2723.24s)]
*  But we have a government that continues to allow that sort of business behavior, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2725.24s)]
*  especially when they have a monopoly on the market. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2729.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's just those are my feelings. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2732.24s)]
*  To me, it feels like it's bullshit. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2734.24s)]
*  To you calling, I'm sure to everybody listening. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2736.24s)]
*  I'd love to have an extra $40 from ticketing fees to go get me a soda or something, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2739.24s)]
*  get me a little butterfinger or something, get mom the payday or whatever she likes eating. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2744.24s)]
*  She can't even hear the fucking show. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2749.24s)]
*  She's over here. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2751.24s)]
*  Cheaper to get her a ticket than put her in dang hospice or whatever. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2752.24s)]
*  You know, she's over here, you know, listening to whatever we're watching, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2756.24s)]
*  you know, Metallica on ice or whatever over here. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2760.24s)]
*  You know, or ice spice on ice or whatever. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2764.24s)]
*  Who knows what the hell they're doing now? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2766.24s)]
*  You know, now they have a new anxiety on ice as a new performance for kids. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2768.24s)]
*  Like what? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2772.24s)]
*  What are we even fucking taking our kids to? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2773.24s)]
*  It's big pharma anxiety on ice brought to you by Live Nation and Pfizer, dude. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2777.24s)]
*  That's what we're fucking doing. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2782.24s)]
*  I mean, yeah, people at least aren't blind to it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2783.24s)]
*  Praise God, brother. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2787.24s)]
*  Thank you for the call. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2789.24s)]
*  And yeah, I'm sorry about it, too, man. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2790.24s)]
*  Let me hear the end. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2791.24s)]
*  Let me hear what you have to say. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2792.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2793.24s)]
*  And I personally would not go see a show just because it's being sold strictly [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2794.24s)]
*  if we take it back. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2799.24s)]
*  So I'm curious if there was some kind of way that we can get away from from these [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2801.24s)]
*  big corporations and and hopefully by getting away from them, you know, you could [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2805.24s)]
*  get more of a percentage of ticket sales and that that. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2811.24s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2814.24s)]
*  I mean, those venues, they could give away to something. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2815.24s)]
*  They could do something. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2817.24s)]
*  You know, they also, yeah, they charge people for parking a lot of times or it's [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2819.24s)]
*  just that's but some of it is business. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2823.24s)]
*  But that part, I believe, is egregious. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2825.24s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2827.24s)]
*  But no, as of right now, I don't know another way. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2828.24s)]
*  You know, I could look into it, though. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2834.24s)]
*  Maybe one day I'll have, you know, I could own venues with other people and we could [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2836.24s)]
*  just do the shows there at our own venues and we wouldn't sell ticket and we [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2840.24s)]
*  wouldn't gouge people on those prices. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2844.24s)]
*  Or maybe you'd find one politician that would just run simply on the fact that [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2850.24s)]
*  they're going to say, hey, fuck those guys. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2853.24s)]
*  We're not going to let them do it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2855.24s)]
*  We're going to figure out a way. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2856.24s)]
*  So it's just those greedy companies and dirty lawyers, I believe. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2858.24s)]
*  But also there may be stuff I don't know about it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2862.24s)]
*  They may need an extra forty two dollars a ticket to send you that email. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2865.24s)]
*  So I might be off. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2871.24s)]
*  What else? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2876.24s)]
*  What else? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2877.24s)]

*  Let me think about what else I'm thankful for, man. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2882.24s)]

*  I would like to do a better job of that in the coming year, checking in on people [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2890.24s)]
*  and checking in on myself. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2896.24s)]
*  You know, I want to make sure I do a better job of that. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=2898.24s)]

*  numb the pain of loneliness, boredom, anxiety and depression. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3281.24s)]

*  others. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3358.24s)]

*  I was like how can I make next year, how can I do more? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3360.24s)]

*  We all want to. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3368.24s)]
*  I hear that so many times from people like hey how can I be a part of this? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3369.24s)]
*  How can I do, you know? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3372.24s)]
*  And so yeah I've been thinking about that a lot and I'm going to, I want to figure that [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3374.24s)]
*  out you know. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3380.24s)]
*  Just ways to, we all want to find ways to give back to help our neighbor you know. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3381.24s)]
*  And this is the time of year for that to be on our hearts. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3389.24s)]
*  I think, or I don't know I'm not trying to preach at you. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3392.24s)]
*  This is the time of year where that's on my heart. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3394.24s)]
*  You know how can I? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3397.24s)]
*  How can I think about somebody else? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3401.24s)]
*  Because what a relief it is when you're trapped in yourself to have a moment where you're [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3403.24s)]
*  thinking about somebody else. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3407.24s)]
*  You're like oh thank you God. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3408.24s)]
*  Let me think about somebody else man. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3410.24s)]
*  What else? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3415.24s)]
*  Let's take a couple more calls here on the way out. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3416.24s)]
*  Let me take this one right here. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3419.24s)]
*  Hey Theo. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3423.24s)]
*  I love the show. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3424.24s)]
*  I'm calling with an issue. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3427.24s)]
*  I'm 20 years old. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3429.24s)]
*  I've been drinking every single day since I've been 17. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3431.24s)]
*  There's been times where I stopped drinking for a week. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3435.24s)]
*  I always fall back into the same thing. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3439.24s)]
*  And I hate myself for it. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3442.24s)]
*  Everything pulls me down. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3444.24s)]
*  I'm just wondering if you have any advice for me. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3446.24s)]
*  Yeah I noticed myself man. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3450.24s)]
*  Thanks for calling bro. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3453.24s)]
*  I noticed myself when I'm doing something I don't want to be doing, when I'm doing something [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3454.24s)]
*  I don't want to be doing, and then I've said to myself hey I don't want to do this anymore. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3460.24s)]
*  And then I keep doing it. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3465.24s)]
*  I can't help but do it. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3467.24s)]
*  That's addiction. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3469.24s)]
*  You can't help it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3470.24s)]
*  You're doing it. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3471.24s)]
*  Which isn't you. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3472.24s)]
*  That's not you making that choice all the time. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3474.24s)]
*  It's addiction. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3476.24s)]
*  It's a disease. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3477.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3478.24s)]
*  So it's the same as if somebody had cancer. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3479.24s)]
*  You wouldn't say to them every day oh damn you have cancer. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3481.24s)]
*  You keep choosing to have cancer. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3484.24s)]
*  No. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3486.24s)]
*  They have cancer. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3487.24s)]
*  It's the same with addiction. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3489.24s)]
*  You don't want to do this. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3490.24s)]
*  You're doing it. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3492.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3494.24s)]
*  You can't stop that cycle. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3496.24s)]
*  And then this is what I've noticed for myself. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3500.24s)]
*  Then shame starts building up because now not only am I addicted, now I am addicted. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3502.24s)]
*  Now I am ashamed because I keep breaking my own promise to myself. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3510.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3516.24s)]
*  Now I'm losing my integrity. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3517.24s)]
*  So now not only am I dealing with addiction but I'm also dealing with shame. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3519.24s)]
*  And man when those two dogs get together, good luck getting a frisbee through the yard brother. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3525.24s)]
*  Them some growlers daddy. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3533.24s)]
*  But that's the only, people ask me a lot about addiction stuff. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3535.24s)]
*  The only answer I ever know that has helped me has been going to recovery. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3540.24s)]
*  Going to Alcoholics Anonymous starting there. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3545.24s)]
*  Going to a meeting. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3548.24s)]
*  Because the first thing they ask you in there is that my life, is your life unmanageable? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3550.24s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3557.24s)]
*  Is your life unmanageable? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3558.24s)]
*  Is your life unmanageable? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3561.24s)]
*  Nothing has to be about alcohol or anything. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3564.24s)]
*  Is your life unmanageable? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3566.24s)]
*  Because that's a way where you get to choose for yourself. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3569.24s)]
*  Nobody's making a diagnosis of you being an alcoholic. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3572.24s)]
*  You decide. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3575.24s)]
*  But it's like is life unmanageable? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3577.24s)]
*  And that's a very fair question to anybody. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3580.24s)]
*  And if the answer is yes, then there's more, then you take it from there and there. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3584.24s)]
*  But I would recommend go to 3AA meetings, some different ones. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3590.24s)]
*  Listen for the similarities and don't listen for the differences. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3593.24s)]
*  Because it's easy to be like, ah this shit, no. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3598.24s)]
*  You hear one thing like that ain't for me. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3603.24s)]
*  So yeah man, I'm sorry that you're dealing with that. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3606.24s)]
*  But that's really the only, I don't have a magic button or a magic solution. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3609.24s)]
*  And then once you're in there, you can maybe get some sponsorship or something. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3615.24s)]
*  They can help you decide if you should get treatment or that sort of thing. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3619.24s)]
*  Now if you're drinking every day for that long, you may need treatment to detoxify yourself. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3622.24s)]
*  But thinking of you brother, and thank you for calling man. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3627.24s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3632.24s)]
*  What else? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3635.24s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3639.24s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3641.24s)]
*  What up, yo? Hi. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3642.24s)]
*  Hey, I got a question for you. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3644.24s)]
*  My name is Jocelyn and I have a son here who's 10 years old with Down syndrome. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3646.24s)]
*  Just any advice that you would give to him personally would be much appreciated. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3651.24s)]
*  And we think you're great. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3657.24s)]
*  Keep doing what you're doing bro. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3660.24s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you Jocelyn. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3662.24s)]
*  That was very sweet of you to call. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3664.24s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving to you and to your child right there. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3667.24s)]
*  And I'd say to your child, I'd say hang in there young king. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3670.24s)]
*  Okay? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3675.24s)]
*  You little freckled sparrow of the heavens, hang in there. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3676.24s)]
*  Hold the line baby boy. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3680.24s)]
*  Because young DS lords like yourself are heroes. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3683.24s)]
*  And you are beloved. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3689.24s)]
*  You are God's thank you card. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3691.24s)]
*  There's not any of us in existence that doesn't see somebody with Down syndrome. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3694.24s)]
*  And feel something, you know. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3702.24s)]
*  You make a candle, a candle just light up inside of everybody. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3704.24s)]
*  Y'all are the ones, y'all are the ones braving the genetic nether realm to see what's on the other side. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3709.24s)]
*  Y'all are the Lewis and Clarks of DNA. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3718.24s)]
*  Okay? The Harriet Tubman of afflictions. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3721.24s)]
*  That's y'all young king. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3725.24s)]
*  And every year we're getting closer to winning this war. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3728.24s)]
*  I'll say that out loud. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3733.24s)]
*  We will battle with Down syndrome until it's all the way down. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3736.24s)]
*  We will not relent. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3742.24s)]
*  So keep hugging your mom and keep being a bumblebee of hope for all of us. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3744.24s)]
*  And keep smiling because when you smile, when people with Down syndrome smile, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3753.24s)]
*  we all smile somehow. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3760.24s)]
*  Because we all have that, just a, not a DS but a D-O-S-E of it inside of us. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3763.24s)]
*  And I believe that, you know. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3776.24s)]
*  And that's why we can relate. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3778.24s)]
*  And I love you and I love your mom. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3780.24s)]
*  And I wish y'all a happy Thanksgiving. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3782.24s)]
*  And keep teaching the rest of us how to love better. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3785.24s)]
*  You know? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3788.24s)]
*  Because I was right there in it. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3790.24s)]
*  I was right there just in the grips. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3791.24s)]

*  Okay. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3815.24s)]
*  I'm struggling. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3820.24s)]
*  It's just hard going back and forth trying to find a job with an addiction. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3823.24s)]
*  It's really hard. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3829.24s)]
*  I can't seem to put the alcohol down. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3832.24s)]
*  The funny thing is, I listened to your podcast because of how you talked about coke. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3839.24s)]
*  And I've been struggling with putting it down. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3847.24s)]
*  And I just get to the point where I just, I get so deep you can't get out of it. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3855.24s)]
*  And I know that you know what I mean. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3861.24s)]

*  I think it's powerful that they feel like they could reach out to you to talk about it with someone who can relate. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3892.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3898.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think there's a part of it's like you want to, you can just tell when somebody's hurting, you know? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3899.24s)]

*  Is that crazy, you think, Trevin? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3910.24s)]

*  Yeah, yeah it is. Who's this? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3952.24s)]
*  Holy shit. You actually listened to it? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3954.24s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes it takes me a while, dude. It fricking takes me a while. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3956.24s)]
*  But we just happened to start lists just like we've been listening for the past couple weeks to try and do like an episode to come out next week. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3960.24s)]
*  And so, yeah, today I was listening to them and I just heard your message and it just like, yeah, you know, I'll struggle with shit. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3969.24s)]
*  So I just thought I would just say what's up or, you know. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3976.24s)]
*  Dude, I just had a wreck like two days ago and. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3979.24s)]
*  Oh, what happened? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3984.24s)]
*  I don't know how I didn't die. I was not paying attention and I got, I like rear-ended them but I was flying and I shouldn't have. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3986.24s)]
*  And it totaled the fuck out of my car. I don't know how I died. I just came out with a small concussion and nobody else was hurt. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=3993.24s)]
*  And did you have insurance? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4002.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting taken care of but it's just been a shitty week. I got cheated on too. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4003.24s)]
*  So. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4010.24s)]
*  Oh, that's a. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4011.24s)]
*  I can't believe you actually listened to my voice. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4013.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, it just shook me. You know, I mean, it just made me, you know, it's like you're having to go through a tough time and I've been there for sure. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4015.24s)]
*  I'm going on 19 hours. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4023.24s)]
*  Of no drinking? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4027.24s)]
*  Right now. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4028.24s)]
*  Let's go. That's awesome. Dude, 19 hours is big. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4029.24s)]
*  I know it's a lot for me. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4034.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it is. I'm happy for you. That's awesome. What do you think? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4036.24s)]
*  So what time of day or what kind of happens that you start to you feel like you start to fall apart a little bit or make you drink? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4041.24s)]
*  Well, it was really the start of my job. I started a job last year. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4049.24s)]
*  We ended up having a word like it was a mandatory seven days a week and it's been like that the whole time I started and I finally they fired me in October. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4053.24s)]
*  That's when shit really started to fall apart. I started showing up drinking on the job and stuff. It was just getting really rough. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4063.24s)]
*  Yeah, so you just drinking and get by, huh? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4072.24s)]
*  Yeah, I went through a couple of relationships. I tried to make relationships and just got shit on. It's just it's been a rough year really. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4077.24s)]
*  Yeah, dang. And where do you got family over there now? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4086.24s)]
*  Yeah, I live with my mom and my dad. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4091.24s)]
*  Oh nice. You have any children? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4093.24s)]
*  I'm 24. I'm still living a little bit of life at current. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4096.24s)]
*  Oh, well, look, I think you got some blessings right there. And this you don't have a you don't have a responsibility outside of yourself. You got to take care of. That's nice. You know, yeah, I mean, except for your folks, you know. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4100.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4110.24s)]
*  Do you ever go to a meetings or anything? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4112.24s)]
*  No, I've never thought about it. I got put on medication a while back, but I got off of it. And I think that kind of made it worse because it's like cold turkey. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4117.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that can be tricky. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4127.24s)]
*  But I felt like the medicine was just making me more diverse, but it could be from the drinking to while drinking on it. So I've never had like talk to a therapist or anybody about it. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4129.24s)]
*  What do you feel? I mean, do you feel like you drank too much? You just feel like you feel bad? I mean, are you just feel like maybe just had a tough couple days? No judgment either. I'm not judging you. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4140.24s)]
*  Yeah, I just I've been through I know there's people out there that go through worse things. I have was in a relationship for a few years before I moved back in with my parents. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4152.24s)]
*  And it's abusive. I lost I had a I was pregnant. I lost my baby. And I think that's where it all started. This is really hard. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4166.24s)]
*  Yeah, I bet that's tough. I probably just I don't know what it is. Did you start? Yeah, like what did you start feeling you think? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4180.24s)]
*  I just felt like I couldn't do nothing. I couldn't anymore. I think that's where it all started like to fall apart for me. And I kept trying to like get back up and just bringing them back down. And then I just picked up alcohol. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4188.24s)]
*  And it's funny because I used to never want to drink not even when I turned 21. Yeah, it's just a lot of baggage. I feel like oh yeah. Oh, if I just can't feel if I feel like I just can't do good anymore. That's horrible feeling. Yeah. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4203.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry. You've been dealing with all that. I'm trying to get back up on my feet. Get another job. I think that's not working and stuff like that is really you just sitting at home thinking in your head all the time. I don't have one friend and I love it. She always tried to help me but I'm kind of a hard head and not listen to you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, we can't. Yeah, it's hard. Yeah, don't try to help me. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4220.24s)]
*  Well, dang. Yeah, I wish there was some way that I could help out. You know, I wish there was something I could do to be supportive. Yeah, I mean, do they have therapists in your town? Do you think even going to somebody like that would help? I'm just trying to think of something that might help you get a better, you know, or do you need to get a new job? Do you think you could even work right now? What do you think's going on? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4251.24s)]
*  I don't, I don't even I don't know how to start. I don't know if I've always like been around people that tell me therapy doesn't work. You don't need to go to pay somebody to tell them about your problems because they don't care. Yeah, stuff like that. So I guess I kind of just stuck that in my head that I didn't need to go talk to people about it. I guess. Yeah, I kind of just hold it in until I explode. Yeah. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4272.24s)]
*  Well, yeah, I just don't know if that's good or not. I don't know if it's good for anything to hold anything in that long, you know. No, it's not. But I've always grew up where you don't talk about your emotions that much. So I have a normal brain. Oh, yeah, dude. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4299.24s)]
*  Oh, God, if I if you felt something in my neighborhood, somebody call you a dang f***, to be honest with you, you know. Yeah. And no offense. I didn't say that. I think it's a. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4313.24s)]
*  No, that's exactly how it is. But damn, yeah, I feel you there. Well, how about this? Maybe I'll just is it. I'll check back in with you in like a week or something to see how things are going. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4322.24s)]
*  Okay, that it really helped me call it. You actually heard me. It just felt made me feel better. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4336.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, I know what that's. Yeah, I can relate to that for sure. Yeah, just sometimes you just need to make a list. Yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4342.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, man. I feel that. I feel that. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4356.24s)]
*  Yeah, I feel that. I definitely feel that. Yeah, it feels good to get that. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4364.24s)]
*  Yeah, it feels good to get it out. But some people just don't want to hear about your problems. They're always like, well, I'm doing this. I'm doing that. Everybody's doing shit. Yeah. But sometimes you just need somebody to help and not make you feel crazy for it. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4369.24s)]
*  Yeah. And you're right. Sometimes we just want somebody to listen. You know, we just want something to be, you know, we just want a place to put something. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4388.24s)]
*  There's obviously different things you could go do to try to get help for yourself, you know, or if you wanted to. You have insurance or no? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4396.24s)]
*  Yeah, I do. Okay, cool. So you could if you wanted to try therapy, then you could try it at least. You know, I know it takes time to like try and figure that out. But that is a thing. And then, yeah, but yeah, how about this? I'll just yeah, I just want to just I'll check back in like in a week or something and just see how you're doing. Is that okay if I check back in? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4402.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4421.24s)]
*  Okay, cool. All right, well, have a good time over there. What y'all gonna do for Thanksgiving? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4422.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4429.24s)]
*  What are your parents doing? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4432.24s)]
*  They're cooking some food. I'm not on good terms with my brother right now, so it's gonna be kind of awkward. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4435.24s)]
*  Damn, I wish I could figure that out before he gets over there. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4443.24s)]
*  Everybody tells me to apologize. I need to stop holding the grudge. I know I do. I'm working on it. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4445.24s)]
*  Yeah, I feel you. Sometimes that stuff's hard. You know, it's hard. Maybe. I don't know. I feel you. I struggle with that. I got the same issues with some of my family. It's tough. You know, it's families tough. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4451.24s)]
*  But yeah, if I can't swallow my pride for my family, you know, at least do it for myself for others, you know, because it don't have to be about me on Thanksgiving. That's what I started thinking the other day. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4465.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4476.24s)]
*  You know, I don't I don't deserve to ruin other people's day just because I have feelings a certain way. You know, I should be able to figure that out. I'm not telling you that I'm just saying that to me really. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4478.24s)]
*  Gotta be humble. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4489.24s)]
*  Well, I just I should be able to approach somebody in my family at the end of the day, say over the last minute on Earth. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4490.24s)]
*  What do I what do I want that family member to think? I want them to think, oh, I was holding something against them, you know, that I couldn't figure out, you know, like, no, I would want my family member to think that I love them, you know, and so I got to figure that out even if it's for short term basis, you know, I'm not going to be able to do that. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4498.24s)]
*  I don't know. I just don't want. Yeah, I don't want to be always a part of the problem, you know. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4511.24s)]

*  OK, so no matter what, there's no way you can do it. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4866.24s)]
*  There's no way you can do it with one leg. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4868.24s)]
*  You have one leg and no arms. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4869.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4871.24s)]
*  And you're just laying naked. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4872.24s)]
*  You're laying naked on the beach on this deserted island. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4873.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4876.24s)]
*  OK. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4877.24s)]
*  And but you have a strong libido. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4878.24s)]
*  All right. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4879.24s)]
*  And you're a heterosexual male like you like you. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4880.24s)]
*  I mean, like you probably are. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4883.24s)]
*  I don't know for certain, but you probably are heterosexual males. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4884.24s)]
*  You're heterosexual male. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4886.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4887.24s)]
*  And you have a strong libido. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4888.24s)]
*  You can't. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4890.24s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, there's another man on the island. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4891.24s)]
*  Oh. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4893.24s)]
*  So here's the question. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4895.24s)]
*  Do you eventually have sex with this man? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4896.24s)]
*  No, I don't think you do. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4899.24s)]
*  Now, for me, it's a hell yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4902.24s)]

*  I don't mean like, well, yeah, think about it. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4908.24s)]
*  Which if you can't if you can't masturbate, you can't date for a long time. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4910.24s)]
*  First, or is there any or how does it even know one day you're out there just laying on the beach because you can't walk. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4914.24s)]
*  You have one leg. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4920.24s)]
*  You can get up right now. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4922.24s)]
*  Well, you could you could knee over you could knee over you could hobble over and then kind of from the distance. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4923.24s)]
*  Here comes this one man walking and he's got two legs. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4930.24s)]

*  He's got a shirt. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4937.24s)]
*  He's got a shirt, but you can see his chest and you guys just strike it up. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4938.24s)]
*  You know, you start to make a little just listen to this thing. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4942.24s)]
*  You make a little bonfire together. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4947.24s)]

*  But suddenly you're a damn weeblow scout. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4954.24s)]
*  No, bro. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJFG9VesmQ&t=4956.24s)]
