*  Wanting to be like a parent and getting into that vibe like was that was that ever a thing it? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=114.62s)]
*  You know it was a process it I got married right out of high school and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=118.94s)]
*  Did what everybody else did you either did one of two things you either went to college? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=124.34s)]
*  Which that wasn't an option for me. No judgment, bro. You know [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=128.54s)]
*  How's this hard exactly or you got married and went to work, so I got married to my high school sweetheart and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=133.22s)]
*  Went to work for heating and air-conditioned wholesale company down in Georgia [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  So was that a check were you getting in the attics or you just selling the equipment? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=145.74s)]
*  I was selling the equipment, okay, but I was also going to school like [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=148.82000000000002s)]
*  two or three times a year to find out all of the you know updated products and kind of be a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=152.46s)]
*  Troubleshooter you know for for all the products so I did that and I started out on the docks loading trucks and worked my [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=158.82s)]
*  way up to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=166.86s)]
*  Manager of the store for in about 18 months and we are hard worker [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=168.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean well, that's right around that same time is when I started [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=173.54s)]
*  Wanting to play music as well and so that marriage lasted for about two and a half years [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=179.18s)]
*  And as soon as that marriage was over [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=185.1s)]
*  I started playing clubs at night and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  Then six days a week Monday through Saturday [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=192.34s)]
*  And then I would play I would go and get get up the next morning and go and do my gig [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=195.18s)]
*  So it that nearly killed me even though I was very young right nearly killed me just those hours that that rep [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=200.38s)]
*  And do you think if you had stayed married in that first marriage would you think you think you would have had the same career? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=206.06s)]
*  Was there inspiration that came out of getting a separation at that young age was it were you just too young to even? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  be able to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  Put any of that any of those feelings into music didn't he I wouldn't even have thought about it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=220.06s)]
*  Probably at that particular time thought about music. Yeah as a full-time gig [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean I played occasionally with you know I had a little band that I played with you know every now and then but [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  not very often and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=234.58s)]
*  I was kind of my wife at the time she kind of discouraged me from doing that too because you know when you're [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=236.62s)]
*  New young couple yeah, you don't want your husband out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=244.62s)]
*  You know riff raffin around all over the place man [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=248.9s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not even look play doing a live performance [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  It's not a real job to people until you start to really make it. I feel like that's right [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean until then you're just a really you're just somebody's trying to break up marriages around the area I feel like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=259.94s)]
*  Like people are like this shit is a little straight [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  Good analogy it really is so but that whole thing just it just worked out and I [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=269.74s)]
*  Did I did the day job and the night job for oh? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=276.86s)]

*  Started realizing that I was having more fun at my night job than I was at my day job and oddly enough [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=286.18s)]
*  I was making more money at my night job. Oh dang my day job, so I [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=291.46000000000004s)]

*  I felt like when I got to a certain level of like a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=451.7s)]
*  Like mild popularity or comfort like that every all my problems would go away right or other things would disappear [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=455.06s)]
*  But really you're just still right there. Oh, it's it's it those things never change [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=461.62s)]

*  You're either writing or recording or [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=493.97999999999996s)]
*  You're out on the road performing concerts, or you're doing videos or doing press or doing whatever [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=497.34s)]

*  Find a way to make a living with it, and you'll never work a day in your life, and that's really true for me [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=545.74s)]

*  I mean I did about a year and a half a torn and it was so intense like [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=638.9s)]

*  Was there a time when you had to kind of check your ego at all because the ego is a dangerous thing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=654.78s)]
*  It's not even something we control [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=659.54s)]
*  You know that ego it can start to because you see a reflection yourself so often in posters and in people's smiles [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=661.14s)]
*  They're so excited to see yeah little things like that. It can creep into your soul and build you up [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=667.06s)]
*  Did you ever struggle with it? I don't know that I never necessarily struggle with ego, but [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=671.4599999999999s)]
*  Obviously when you're just trying to get started and especially back in those days [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=678.9s)]
*  It's everybody's in competition with each other and there weren't [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=684.82s)]
*  As far as all of the people that were the newcomers [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=690.58s)]
*  They were they didn't hang out a lot, you know together with each other [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=694.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean everybody's kind of and they're very secretive [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=698.7s)]
*  They're keeping their stuff to themselves because they don't want to rush almost or something exactly [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=701.52s)]
*  They don't want anybody else to know [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=706.18s)]
*  Exactly what it is that they're doing for their recipe for success [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=708.8599999999999s)]
*  And so it gets competitive and I've always been a competitive guy. Yeah, you know, I like to compete and I like to win. Yeah [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=712.78s)]

*  there there comes a point in time where you have to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=721.9399999999999s)]
*  Realize that hey a little friendly competition. There's nothing wrong with that. But at the same time you have to remember that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=726.54s)]
*  You know, nobody was more surprised to have the career success than I was I remember in the early days man [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=736.3s)]
*  You know you dream about it. You dream about wanting to have that but and it becomes a reality [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=743.56s)]
*  I mean when it becomes a reality, I remember being on stage man [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=748.4599999999999s)]
*  And I'm you know, you'd be into these big huge arenas that seated [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=752.5799999999999s)]
*  You know 25,000 people and it's sold out and they're there to see you and I'm looking at the band and looking at the guys [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=757.4599999999999s)]
*  And it's gone [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=766.06s)]
*  Can you believe this shit is happening? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=767.26s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, there's something sometimes there's some surprising moments. You can never really live in the fame or in the popularity [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=777.5799999999999s)]
*  It's almost like it's something that's bigger than you. It's exactly it's like [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=783.98s)]
*  You can't really wear it that much [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=788.9399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't feel like I mean, I guess you could if you really wanted to that would almost seem bizarre [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=790.98s)]
*  But it's almost something that even though you're sitting in it [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=795.14s)]
*  You marvel at it almost like you're in a pond but you have waiters on or yeah for sure [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=799.22s)]
*  Like it's not seeping into you, but you're right there in it. I think it's [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=803.74s)]
*  for me I [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=807.98s)]
*  Am no more [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=810.42s)]
*  The extrovert that I am on stage [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=812.86s)]
*  In real life [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=817.22s)]
*  Than you could ever imagine I mean I'm just I've always been you know [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=820.22s)]
*  I kind of you know, I'm one of those guys that you know, I kind of keep things on the down low [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=825.3000000000001s)]
*  You know and that sort of thing [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=830.7s)]
*  And any partying I did back in those days. I did pretty much with a very small group. Yeah [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=833.1s)]
*  And it was hidden from the public. Yeah, of course [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=839.7s)]
*  Before cell phones and all that other stuff camera everybody had cameras everywhere that that didn't happen back then but [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=843.7s)]
*  For me it was about just I don't know maintaining [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=852.1800000000001s)]
*  The love for them for the music. Mm-hmm, but being able to [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=859.74s)]
*  You know when the when the when the show is over, it's almost like you put on [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=863.86s)]
*  That's gonna sound bad to say but it's almost like you put on this this [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=868.7s)]
*  Suit that is Travis Tripp, right on stage, of course [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=873.9s)]
*  And then as soon as you come off stage that suit comes off and the real me [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=877.7s)]
*  The real my real personality comes back right through well, I think it's almost a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=882.94s)]
*  Necessity because you also want to be a showman at that point. Like there's a level of [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=889.02s)]
*  There's a level of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  It's not really expectation, but you want to give people their money worth you want to put on your best [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=896.02s)]
*  Self at those, you know, especially at that moment where they come to see you and you came to see them [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=901.46s)]
*  It's like watching a college football game [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=906.26s)]
*  You know if you watch the team right before they run on the field, what are they doing? They're jumping up and down [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=907.96s)]
*  They're banging each other in the head with their helmets and they're firing each other up to go out there on this field man [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=914.1s)]
*  There is nobody on this planet that's gonna do better at what we're about to do on this field [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=921.5s)]
*  Today than us and that's exactly the kind of thing that I have always had to do [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=929.18s)]
*  In order to be able to get up enough nerve to go out on stage and backstage [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=936.6999999999999s)]
*  I would tell myself I started doing this as a ritual and I still do it to this day [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=941.42s)]
*  if I'm backstage and the lights are going down and they're getting ready to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=945.98s)]
*  You know fire off the band and I'm getting ready to run out there [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=949.9399999999999s)]
*  I am backstage jumping up and down and fire myself and I'm telling myself in my head [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=953.14s)]
*  There's no other time that I think this way but at that particular moment I'm thinking to myself there is nobody on [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=962.9s)]
*  this earth [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=971.46s)]

*  Of entertaining these people than what I'm about to do right now [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=978.98s)]

*  You know that a whole lot better at this than I am but in order to get [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=990.8199999999999s)]

*  To how you're feeling and the things that you're dealing with in your life at that particular point [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2636.6200000000003s)]
*  And that's one of the things I I think I miss the most [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2641.5s)]
*  About a lot of today's country music because I just miss those great stories, man [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2645.98s)]

*  In you that made you feel if it makes you feel something. Yeah, I don't care what it is [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2679.2599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, man. I remember i'm trying to think of ones. Well, we went to the dances [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2697.74s)]
*  So a lot of y'all's music they would play at some of our dances once I got like later in high school man [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2701.74s)]

*  There was nothing like that man [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2713.34s)]
*  And that's where music becomes more than just music for a lot of people too [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2716.06s)]
*  It becomes really kind of the soundtrack of your life. Yeah, that's one of the things about music. That's always amazed me. It's like I can remember [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2720.54s)]
*  Where I was [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2729.6600000000003s)]
*  for very specific moments in my life [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2731.58s)]
*  And exactly what song was playing in the background like first time I ever drove my dad's car by myself [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2734.86s)]
*  You know or first time I ever went on a date first time I ever kissed a girl first time [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2740.86s)]

*  in the background for each one of those individual things because because they're [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2751.74s)]
*  They're not just something that's playing in the background. It's the soundtrack of your life and every time I hear that song today [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2757.34s)]
*  Any one of those songs it takes me right back to that spot again, and I think a lot of people music does that for them [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2764.4599999999996s)]

*  You know, we're like man. This is this has worked so well for me [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2862.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm almost scared of getting older growing into something different or anything [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2865.02s)]
*  Did you ever feel like there were moments where your music changed? No, I really didn't I've always kind of used the same recipe [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2868.5400000000004s)]
*  For making records and that is that I just want to include a little bit of each one of those different genres [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2874.94s)]
*  That were so influential to me. So there's going to be [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2882.54s)]
*  In the process of just recording this I just recorded the first album [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2886.78s)]
*  That i've done in studio in 13 years. Oh dang and I recorded it with dave cob who produces [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2891.42s)]
*  Yeah, the legend chris stapleton [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2898.3s)]
*  And sturgill simpson and all those guys and it's done now. Yeah, it's done. And how do you feel good about it? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2900.78s)]
*  I feel great about it. It's going to be out may 7th. It's called set in stone [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2906.2200000000003s)]
*  but [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2911.02s)]
*  People were asking me when people found out that I was going to be doing an album a new album [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2912.2200000000003s)]
*  Um, what's it going to be like man? Are you going straight head country? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2917.6600000000003s)]
*  Are you going more toward the rock side or you're going to do more blues or what are you doing? I submit [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2920.7000000000003s)]
*  The only way I know how to answer that it's going to be a travis tread album [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2926.54s)]
*  And that means that every travis tread album that i've ever done has had the same recipe [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2929.6600000000003s)]
*  Which is show a little bit of the blues show a little bit of the southern rock rock [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2934.54s)]
*  Influence show a little bit of that straight ahead country stuff show a little bit of the bluegrass [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2939.9s)]
*  And just show and sprinkle a little bit of southern gospel over the top of it and that's me [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2945.1800000000003s)]
*  so that's exactly what we did and there's [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2950.62s)]
*  um [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2953.26s)]

*  uh [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=2960.54s)]

*  I think you had some of the best music videos of the 90s [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3290.94s)]
*  I think your performance in your video tell me I was dreaming should have won an oscar [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3295.42s)]
*  My question to you is [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3300.54s)]
*  I know you've done a lot of acting in your career. Which do you prefer? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3302.94s)]
*  full-time rock star [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3307.7400000000002s)]
*  Or full-time movie star. Love you [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3309.5s)]
*  Love you, too. That's a good question, man, because at certain points of of popularity [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3312.94s)]
*  They start to offer you things that they might not have offered you [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3318.06s)]
*  You don't have to go into that room to audition as much. That's it. Exactly man. I had no aspirations [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3321.1s)]
*  Whatsoever about being an actor, right? But did it grow on you though? Well, I enjoyed it and I'll tell you the reason why [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3327.5s)]
*  um [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3335.2599999999998s)]
*  I was always out of my element when I was doing a movie or a television show or whatever it may be [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3336.62s)]
*  When I was doing any kind of acting [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3343.02s)]
*  and [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3346.14s)]
*  So because I was so insecure about it and so nervous about it [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3347.18s)]
*  I didn't just go in and learn my lines. I learned the whole damn script [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3351.18s)]
*  I knew everybody's lines [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3354.94s)]
*  and um [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3356.94s)]
*  Because i'm I have a real hard time multitasking. I I get real [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3359.66s)]
*  Laser focused on whatever it is i'm doing at the moment [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3364.2999999999997s)]
*  So if i'm songwriting i'm focused on that if i'm recording i'm really focused on that [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3367.2599999999998s)]
*  And if i'm performing i'm really focused on that [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3373.02s)]
*  so doing [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3376.54s)]
*  these acting roles [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3378.22s)]
*  It forced me to concentrate so much on that that I completely [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3380.3799999999997s)]
*  Took a vacation from music. I didn't think about music. I didn't talk about music. I didn't [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3385.4199999999996s)]
*  Uh try to write music or whatever [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3391.4199999999996s)]
*  And I found that the benefit of that was when I finished a acting role [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3394.2999999999997s)]
*  And came back to the music. I found that I was more creative [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3400.7s)]
*  um, it was like [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3405.02s)]
*  Man, this is a fresh start again. Yeah, and [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3407.18s)]
*  I wrote better songs [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3410.9399999999996s)]
*  I performed better [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3413.4199999999996s)]
*  My mind was more in the game because if you do anything I think [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3415.2599999999998s)]
*  Over a long period of time same thing over and over again [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3419.98s)]
*  It can tend to get a little bit monotonous. Yeah, but [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3424.06s)]
*  If you get a break from it [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3427.8999999999996s)]
*  And then you get a chance to come back and look at it through [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3429.98s)]
*  A little bit different perspective [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3433.8999999999996s)]
*  uh [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3436.22s)]
*  It helped me tremendously. I think it helps make me a better artist and [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3437.34s)]
*  And a better songwriter and a better entertainer [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3441.82s)]
*  was there um [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3446.3s)]
*  Was there a role ever that you kind of like? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3447.9s)]
*  Oh, this is kind of neat like because acting one of the reasons that people don't know acting if you're a touring artist [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3449.82s)]
*  Acting takes a lot of time. It's a really long. So [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3455.98s)]
*  you know [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3460.06s)]
*  As a musician you could probably do six shows in a daytime of you would do one set or one scene [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3461.34s)]
*  Or half an episode of a tv program or something. So that's one of the reasons I think a lot of uh, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3466.7799999999997s)]
*  Entertainers don't go over and acting that aren't actors. Um, was there a role or something you felt like you kind of got into or something? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3472.36s)]

*  When I met my wife [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3722.2200000000003s)]
*  I've been married three times. This is my third marriage like get hit by rice, huh? Yeah bird seed [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3725.58s)]

*  But we were at hillary williams birthday last night and she said uh, she had a ton of nice things to say about you guys [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3743.1s)]
*  She's just wonderful [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3747.66s)]
*  But I knew as soon as I met her that this person is it wasn't love at first sight [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3748.7799999999997s)]
*  But it was darn sure heavy attraction at the first sight man because she not only was she beautiful, but she [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3755.3399999999997s)]
*  Was just so down to earth and relatable and that's that's the kind of people I grew up around [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3762.54s)]
*  so we just kind of gravitated toward each other and it just [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3768.22s)]

*  You know could have been last week [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=3783.02s)]

*  the hard way playing all those smoky clubs like you're talking about those smoky bars and dives and [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4167.259999999999s)]
*  beer joints and honky tonks and [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4173.82s)]
*  Bowling alleys and pool halls and bowling is always the weird. Oh man weird place man, right? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4176.28s)]
*  You're hitting a low note and somebody just damn gets a split [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4182.139999999999s)]
*  But you're having to compete against all of that and plus you're having to compete against alcohol [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4187.179999999999s)]
*  To try to get these people's attention and every one of the places that I played man they had [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4192.219999999999s)]
*  They either had pool tables or they had dart boards or they had [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4197.42s)]
*  Pinball machines or maybe all of the above so you're trying to compete against all that [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4201.98s)]
*  and [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4207.82s)]
*  It was difficult man. It was rough and [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4209.42s)]
*  I went through a lot of nights where [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4213.099999999999s)]
*  I how in the world am I going to get these people's attention? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4216.06s)]
*  But I even though I hated [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4220.46s)]
*  some of those [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4223.58s)]
*  Instances that I was put in some of those positions I was put in [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4225.64s)]
*  I wouldn't take anything for him now because I learned I learned how if the show [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4230.14s)]
*  is uh interrupted for whatever reason if you break a guitar string for example, or if a mic quits working [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4238.3s)]
*  Or something [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4245.26s)]
*  You learn how to keep people's attention. You learn how to keep the patter up you learn how to [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4247.18s)]
*  Work your way through it [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4254.22s)]
*  And those are the things that I still [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4256.7s)]
*  pull from the that [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4260.38s)]
*  book of knowledge [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4262.3s)]
*  I still pull from that every single day when I get on stage [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4264.3s)]
*  so was there a song that you would go to because it's funny you say that because I remember being in places where [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4267.58s)]
*  The the the music was secondary to the liquor [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4273.26s)]
*  So it's like these people are having a good time. We're gonna also let you do comedy over here [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4276.62s)]
*  Right, but if you have you want to get everybody's attention, that's gonna you have to do that [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4281.02s)]
*  There's nobody in here is going to help you do that [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4284.22s)]
*  You know was there a song or something you went to sometimes when you realize okay [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4286.22s)]
*  I gotta kind of reel it back in here ever when you were starting. Yeah, there were there were two [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4290.06s)]
*  Songs that I really learned right off the bat [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4295.02s)]
*  Um after playing clubs because I started out with just an acoustic guitar and that was it and then um [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4297.9800000000005s)]
*  I went out in [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4307.1s)]
*  Probably, I don't know. It was probably [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4309.42s)]
*  1984 [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4313.88s)]
*  and I went out and bought a fender twin amp and I bought a fender stratocaster and [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4315.58s)]
*  Somehow I've never even [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4323.26s)]
*  Seen one since then but I bought a hundred foot guitar cord [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4326.22s)]
*  So the first the first two songs I first two sets rather that night [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4331.900000000001s)]
*  You know because they're serving food in there too. It's a bar restaurant kind of thing [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4337.900000000001s)]
*  The first two sets man. I'm up there with my acoustic guitar and i'm playing james taylor and john denver and you know, whatever george straight [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4342.54s)]
*  But by the time it got to that third one [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4350.22s)]
*  Pull out that electric guitar [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4353.18s)]
*  And that hundred foot guitar cord and i'm running out on top of people's tables kicking beer and shit over, you know [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4355.26s)]
*  And just but I had their attention [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4360.7s)]
*  Absolutely, man [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4364.4400000000005s)]
*  Absolutely, and i'm doing uh, johnny b good. Yeah, you know and stuff like that traveling man getting people's attention [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4366.46s)]
*  On the other side of that coin. I found out that [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4373.58s)]
*  Because you'd have fights that would break out, you know [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4377.26s)]
*  Yeah, what do you play a ballad then what do you do at that point man? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4381.1s)]
*  I found out the not only a ballad but the right ballad [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4384.620000000001s)]
*  Nobody can fight [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4390.06s)]
*  I learned this [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4391.900000000001s)]
*  Right off the bat, man. Nobody can fight if you play silent night [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4394.38s)]
*  The christmas song [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4400.06s)]
*  That will stop a fight quicker than anything on this planet [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4403.580000000001s)]
*  I could see that man [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4411.18s)]
*  So [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4413.26s)]
*  Yeah, man [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4414.38s)]
*  So I learned those two things right off the bat. I learned how to take them up [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4415.26s)]
*  And I learned how to take them down if it got a little bit too crazy [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4419.1s)]
*  You know, i'm so bad at karaoke my song that i've always done is rocking around the christmas tree, right? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4423.34s)]
*  I do that at karaoke no matter what time of year it is and people like at first like this guy's fucking idiot [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4427.02s)]
*  But then about it's only a two minute and 16 second song the one I do [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4432.46s)]
*  So about a minute and you kind of see people are kind of okay with it and then you're done [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4436.9400000000005s)]
*  So you kind of got it out of your system [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4440.9400000000005s)]
*  But I can relate to going to a christmas carol, man. Yeah, man using it when you need it. It worked. Um [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4443.18s)]
*  What's it like to be a father man? What's that? What's that experience been like for you man? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4449.02s)]
*  It's the greatest thing in the world. I did. You know, it would be going into it [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4453.1s)]
*  Did you have skepticism about because I have a lot of fear going about going in and being a father? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4456.54s)]
*  You know, i'm not a father yet. I uh [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4460.46s)]
*  No, I really didn't because and I guess the reason that I didn't was because [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4462.9400000000005s)]
*  after my second [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4467.66s)]
*  uh divorce [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4469.9800000000005s)]
*  I basically took about [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4471.98s)]
*  Six eight years [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4474.54s)]
*  And man, I I played the field. I sowed all the wild oats [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4476.379999999999s)]
*  That I could possibly was out there, huh? Oh big time. Okay and played the field [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4481.419999999999s)]
*  And the good thing about it was I figured out [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4487.259999999999s)]
*  during that period of time [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4491.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, this is what I do want [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4493.099999999999s)]
*  And that right there is what I definitely don't want [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4495.339999999999s)]
*  and I [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4499.0199999999995s)]
*  So by the time that I met my wife [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4501.02s)]
*  Uh, I knew exactly what I was looking for and I knew she was it [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4503.9800000000005s)]
*  and so [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4508.3s)]
*  having [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4509.5s)]
*  Kids with somebody like that that you feel that way about it's not scary at all [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4510.780000000001s)]
*  At least it wasn't for me it now it would have been [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4515.580000000001s)]
*  extremely terrifying [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4519.240000000001s)]
*  Had it happened in the first two marriages, but we [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4521.02s)]
*  Thank gosh. I got nothing. Yeah got through both of those with no kids [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4524.38s)]
*  but uh, I remember [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4528.620000000001s)]
*  Being excited to be a father [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4530.7s)]
*  um and [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4533.099999999999s)]

*  my my daughter [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4536.3s)]
*  When she was born [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=4538.54s)]

*  So I heard a uh, this is a rumor and this is just like there's lore out there [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5189.740000000001s)]
*  There was a that the song here's a quarter that you got tired of playing because people would throw quarters on stage [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5194.3s)]
*  Actually, I didn't get tired of playing it. I got hit by one. No way [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5200.22s)]
*  When we first started playing that song [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5204.06s)]
*  We were playing small clubs [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5207.02s)]
*  So even and people would start throwing quarters up on stage [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5209.9800000000005s)]
*  And even if they threw if they threw one it's not gonna hurt anybody [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5213.9800000000005s)]
*  But when we when we start playing theaters [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5218.46s)]
*  and you're [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5221.02s)]
*  you're [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5222.22s)]
*  Third row balcony [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5223.98s)]
*  To throw a quarter hard enough do that people that are crazy as hell, man [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5225.9s)]
*  So we started getting pelted [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5231.419999999999s)]
*  I would look down [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5234.54s)]
*  and [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5236.219999999999s)]
*  Sorry to laugh at it. It's crazy to think oh no some guy in the third row like man [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5237.0199999999995s)]
*  I think Travis needs this for at least I didn't have Leonard skinner's problem [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5240.78s)]
*  Leonard skinner had a song way back in the 70s called give me back my bullets and people would throw live ammunition on stage [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5245.58s)]
*  Oh man, but this guy I was on stage one night in [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5254.7s)]
*  In nox I think it was in Knoxville, Tennessee [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5263.419999999999s)]
*  and [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5266.299999999999s)]
*  I got hit [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5268.379999999999s)]
*  Somebody threw one from third row balcony [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5269.98s)]
*  And it hit me right here and I thought I'd been shot. It was just one of those things where it's like [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5273.5s)]
*  Whoa and you kind of lose it for a second and then I looked down and [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5278.860000000001s)]
*  There's blood just stream I got hit right above my right eye [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5286.62s)]
*  And it's just gushing blood [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5291.58s)]
*  so I grab a towel and i'm trying to stop it and [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5294.54s)]
*  I couldn't stop the bleeding so [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5297.58s)]
*  Bottom line is it stopped the show it ended the show [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5299.9800000000005s)]
*  so [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5303.1s)]
*  We had to start making an announcement to people [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5304.54s)]
*  It's like look, you know if you start throwing quarters and somebody gets hurt on stage [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5307.9800000000005s)]
*  you're actually cheating yourself because it's gonna [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5314.3s)]
*  Put it into the show right then. Yeah, and uh, and it raises your ticket price by damn quarter [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5317.820000000001s)]
*  You know kind of [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5324.860000000001s)]
*  But thankfully with venmo now a lot of people have quarters on them. You know what i'm saying? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5326.62s)]
*  Like if I even see a quarter i'd be shocked sometimes [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5330.7s)]
*  I got uh, wow, that's why I got larry the cable guy a couple years ago to do a uh intro for me [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5334.14s)]

*  Please do not throw quarters or any other hard objects at the performers during the program [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UnzEAB6eA&t=5347.42s)]
