*  I'm getting chivered in. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=180.88s)]
*  I'm getting chivered in. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=181.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I'm saying. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=182.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=183.88s)]
*  I don't know either, man. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=184.88s)]
*  Sometimes I don't even know, dude, but you just do it, you know? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=185.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I think the racism that I think is kind of the safest way, if I've seen any, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=188.88s)]
*  to try and do any racism is... [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=194.68s)]
*  I don't know what this is like. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=196.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=197.88s)]
*  But you don't want people doing anything dangerously. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=198.88s)]
*  That's the thing about racism, dude. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=200.88s)]
*  It's like for me, it's like if there's a noose or they're going to drag me in back of a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=202.88s)]
*  truck, you know how they used to do that? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=208.88s)]
*  The Italians in the back of a truck and they just drive, you know. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=209.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=213.88s)]
*  Yeah, give us a ride, you know what I mean? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=214.88s)]
*  Like you're wake skating or something? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=216.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's like a reverse rickshaw. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=218.88s)]
*  It's like the white version of a rickshaw. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=220.88s)]
*  But if it's like if comics are being racist amongst, you know, we're amongst friends, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=223.88s)]
*  I like it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=230.88s)]
*  But if I don't know you, dude, and I'm at an airport and you're like, what's up, chigger? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=231.88s)]
*  It's like, it's like, oh, I don't like it at all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=236.88s)]
*  It breaks my heart, dude. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=239.88s)]
*  It breaks my heart, dude. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=240.88s)]
*  The saddest thing, I think, but also the thing that kind of like if say like you're hanging [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=241.88s)]
*  out with somebody, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=247.88s)]
*  And you guys are different ethnicities or whatever. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=249.88s)]
*  Give me specifics. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=253.88s)]
*  Okay, because depending on what kind of ethnicity, it depends on how I react. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=254.88s)]
*  Okay, say you're hanging out with like a Muslim guy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=259.88s)]

*  So and somebody drives by in a truck, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=283.88s)]
*  Because it's always a truck, I guess. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=285.88s)]
*  It's always a truck. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=286.88s)]
*  It always is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=287.88s)]
*  And yells out, get out the streets, slim. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=288.88s)]
*  They call them slims a lot of times. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=292.88s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=295.88s)]
*  They call who slims? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=296.88s)]
*  Muslims. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=297.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=298.88s)]
*  I've never heard that before. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=299.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=300.88s)]
*  I feel like you make shit up, dude. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=301.88s)]
*  I've never heard anyone go, what's up? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=303.88s)]
*  Like after 9-11, those slims, bro? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=305.88s)]
*  They never said that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=308.88s)]
*  Bro, people, it's definitely been said. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=309.88s)]
*  That has been said. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=312.88s)]
*  You said it probably a thousand times. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=313.88s)]
*  That's why. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=315.88s)]
*  And you heard yourself say it and you're like, oh, that's a thing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=316.88s)]
*  I've never heard slim, bro. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=318.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=321.88s)]
*  So I'm with Fihian. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=322.88s)]
*  We're walking down the street. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=323.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=324.88s)]
*  Truck drives by. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=325.88s)]
*  Get out the streets, slims. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=326.88s)]
*  Now, I think we would look, honestly, I think we would look at each other and go, was they [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=329.88s)]
*  talking about me? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=334.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=335.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=336.88s)]
*  Or you, because we've never heard slim before. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=337.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=338.88s)]
*  So we would both, we'd both absorb it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=339.88s)]
*  Understood. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=341.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=342.88s)]
*  But what I'm thinking is the best way for any racism to occur, that it shouldn't occur. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=343.88s)]
*  It should never occur. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=346.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=347.88s)]
*  If it has to occur in the world. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=348.88s)]
*  Sometimes it has to, right? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=349.88s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=350.88s)]
*  Sometimes it has to. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=351.88s)]
*  I don't think, look, I don't, I think a little bit keeps things, it keeps, you know. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=352.88s)]
*  It keeps the engine running. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=360.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=361.88s)]
*  It keeps the engine, yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=362.88s)]
*  And let's not use the term engine. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=364.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=365.88s)]
*  Well, what I'm saying is that I think you, the best way for racism to occur, if it has [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=366.88s)]
*  to occur, is if somebody drives and yells it out of her, because then they're gone. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=375.88s)]
*  It's over. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=380.88s)]
*  It happens. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=381.88s)]
*  So drive by racism. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=382.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=383.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=384.88s)]
*  But you're saying that's OK. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=385.88s)]
*  No, I don't think it's OK, but I think it's the safest way for it to. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=386.88s)]
*  It's the safest way to do it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=387.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=389.88s)]
*  But then if they do a U-turn, then we got a problem. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=390.88s)]
*  What's up, slim? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=393.88s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, that's, eee, they turn around. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=394.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=397.88s)]
*  Then we're running. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=398.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=399.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=400.88s)]
*  And we don't even know, me and Fiam, we don't even know who they're talking about. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=401.88s)]
*  But we're both going to run just in case, you know? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=403.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=406.88s)]
*  You know, can I be honest with you, man? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=407.88s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=408.88s)]
*  You don't have a racist bone in your body, man. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=409.88s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=411.88s)]
*  I don't think so, man. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=413.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so either, dude. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=417.88s)]
*  I can name a few comments that may, you know, mean they kind of lean, you know, I want to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=419.88s)]
*  name any. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=423.88s)]
*  Oh, can I just get out this out of the way, bro? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=424.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=426.88s)]
*  And I have some resentments, not towards you, but toward the community. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=427.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=430.88s)]
*  I'm going to. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=431.88s)]
*  So anyway, what happened? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=432.88s)]
*  Well, yesterday was my birthday. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=433.88s)]
*  So over the weekend, you know, me and Bad Friends, we did some shows. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=435.88s)]
*  We were in, um, one of them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=439.88s)]
*  Columbus? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=443.88s)]
*  One of them places. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=444.88s)]
*  No, we were in Pittsburgh, bro. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=445.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=447.88s)]

*  So we're doing a show. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=449.88s)]
*  Sorry, Pittsburgh boy. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=454.88s)]
*  I'm going to get your Playboy subscription. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=456.88s)]
*  Is that Pittsburgh? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=464.88s)]
*  Yeah, if you come down from there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=465.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=467.88s)]

*  Anyway, we're in Pittsburgh. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=469.88s)]
*  We're doing a show. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=470.88s)]
*  Half of the show. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=471.88s)]
*  It's my birthday, right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=472.88s)]
*  So then Andrew goes on, yo, dude, happy birthday. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=473.88s)]
*  Andrew Santino from Bad Friends, your co-host. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=476.88s)]
*  I want to make sure everybody knows you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=479.88s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=481.88s)]
*  We didn't say his name. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=482.88s)]
*  He said Andrew. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=483.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I said it anyway. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=484.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=485.88s)]
*  Andrew Santino. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=486.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=487.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=488.88s)]
*  So then he goes, um, you know, we have happy birthday. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=489.88s)]
*  I got a birthday collage of people sending in, you know what I mean, videos. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=491.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=497.88s)]
*  And I want to say, bro, thank you so much. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=498.88s)]
*  You sent in a video, dude. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=500.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=501.88s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=502.88s)]
*  A lot of people did. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=503.88s)]
*  John Mayer did. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=504.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=505.88s)]
*  Yeah, not the musician. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=506.88s)]
*  You know, I know got him John, who was a mayor at Victorville. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=507.88s)]
*  No, the musician. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=509.88s)]
*  That was a bad joke. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=510.88s)]
*  But John Mayer did, right? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=511.88s)]
*  Whitney Cummings, right? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=512.88s)]
*  The little handsome dwarf who's in the movies with his name, the handsome dwarf, Adam Devine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=513.88s)]
*  No way. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=518.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=519.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=520.88s)]
*  One of the best looking dwarves I've ever seen. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=521.88s)]
*  Better than Peter Dinklage. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=522.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=523.88s)]
*  And they're not acting similar, but in terms of good looking, dude. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=524.88s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=527.88s)]
*  Devine versus Dinklage? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=528.88s)]
*  Dude, that's a show, dude, or a movie or something. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=529.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=532.88s)]
*  It's like Alien versus Predator. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=533.88s)]
*  It'll be that kind of movie. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=534.88s)]
*  I wonder how much Dinklage he's got on him. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=537.88s)]
*  That's got to be an old movie. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=542.88s)]
*  He won't say that all the time. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=543.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=545.88s)]
*  So there was a bunch of people sent in videos. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=546.88s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=548.88s)]
*  Except, and then afterwards, I looked at Andrew and I go, who didn't send one? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=549.88s)]
*  You know me? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=555.88s)]
*  Because he requested a lot. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=556.88s)]
*  I don't want to call anybody out, man, but there's a couple that I don't want to say [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=557.88s)]
*  their names, but it really broke my heart, man. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=561.88s)]
*  They got requests and they never sent one. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=564.88s)]
*  Can I guess who someone could be? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=567.88s)]
*  I can give you some hints. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=568.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=569.88s)]
*  One hint? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=570.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=571.88s)]
*  One of the guys, imagine finding a dead body in a lake, but it's been there for a month [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=572.88s)]
*  and it's bloated. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=580.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it will be bloated. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=581.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=582.88s)]
*  Some of the jewelry, too, will be like. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=583.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=584.88s)]
*  So that's one of them. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=585.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=586.88s)]
*  The other one used to look like that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=587.88s)]
*  What? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=590.88s)]
*  Bert. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=591.88s)]
*  I'm not going to answer that, man. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=592.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=595.88s)]
*  The other guy is friends with the dead body guy who used to look like that, but doesn't, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=596.88s)]
*  and he claims he's Hispanic, but you don't see no Hispanic blood lines in his face. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=601.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=607.88s)]
*  He's like definitely. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=608.88s)]
*  Tom. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=609.88s)]
*  Never said that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=610.88s)]
*  OK, sorry. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=611.88s)]
*  Never said that, man. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=612.88s)]
*  Neither, neither, OK. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=613.88s)]
*  But those are a couple of guys, man, that I thought they were like my boys, dude, and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=614.88s)]
*  they betrayed me a little bit. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=619.88s)]
*  You know, you sent a video, it was long. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=621.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=623.88s)]
*  There were some people that I don't even know that well that sent a video. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=624.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=627.88s)]
*  You know? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=628.88s)]
*  And, you know, it just goes to show you who your friends are, man, in this business. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=629.88s)]
*  You seem like Stevie, right? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=633.88s)]
*  And I seem like your brother. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=634.88s)]
*  It is what my brother does, yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=635.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=636.88s)]
*  We're going to get success. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=637.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=638.88s)]
*  But, you know, when we get emotional, we do this, dude. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=639.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=641.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=642.88s)]
*  So it's like, you know, you think that like they're your, you know, you know those two [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=643.88s)]
*  guys, you know what they're like, man? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=646.88s)]
*  You know what they're like? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=648.88s)]
*  In a war, dude. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=649.88s)]
*  Oh, like, you know, dude, you ever see Forrest Gump? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=650.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=653.88s)]
*  Remember the guy, who's the guy that lost his arms and stuff? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=654.88s)]
*  Oh, uh. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=658.88s)]
*  No, not Dan, not Dan. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=659.88s)]
*  Benedict Armold? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=660.88s)]
*  Not Benedict, I don't know. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=661.88s)]
*  No. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=662.88s)]
*  I'm not even talking about. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=663.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=664.88s)]
*  Lieutenant Dan. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=665.88s)]
*  Remember when, who was he saving when, like, Forrest was running and in the Vietnam War, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=666.88s)]
*  he was grabbed, he went to go save somebody's life? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=672.88s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=674.88s)]
*  Was that him or was it the black guy? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=675.88s)]
*  It was Bubba. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=677.88s)]
*  Bubba. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=678.88s)]
*  Anyway, that's a terrible analogy, but these two guys would not run back from me in a war. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=679.88s)]
*  I feel like if you were in an Iowan war, let's just make up a war like. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=686.88s)]
*  Okay, the war of. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=691.88s)]
*  The Serbian Marena Mantegrate. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=692.88s)]
*  What's it called? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=694.88s)]
*  Mante. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=695.88s)]
*  But wars are going to be sponsored probably by different. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=696.88s)]
*  So it would be like the like, like Amazon war of 2027 or something. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=698.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=704.88s)]
*  And they're, oh, you know what, dude? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=705.88s)]
*  Amazon versus the Eskimos. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=706.88s)]
*  That's never been done. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=707.88s)]
*  There's not a lot of Eskimos. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=708.88s)]
*  I know, but still, if it's cold, dude, they might win. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=710.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=714.88s)]
*  If it's an icy environment, dude. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=715.88s)]
*  Like Hoth. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=716.88s)]
*  Like Amazon versus like who? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=717.88s)]
*  Amazon truck drivers or something? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=719.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=720.88s)]
*  Amazon truck drivers versus Eskimos. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=722.88s)]
*  I mean, that could be a good war. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=724.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=726.88s)]
*  Anyway, you and I are caught up in it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=727.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=728.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=729.88s)]
*  My legs are gone. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=730.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=731.88s)]
*  I feel like you would go. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=732.88s)]
*  I think you'd come back for me, dude. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=733.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'd put you on my on my back, you know. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=735.88s)]
*  What do you mean on your back? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=739.88s)]
*  Like a backpack? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=740.88s)]
*  Backpack, yeah. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=741.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=747.88s)]
*  What I would do with you do, I would put tie a rope to your neck, but not to hang you, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=748.88s)]
*  but I would drag you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=752.88s)]
*  What? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=753.88s)]
*  It sounds very... [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=754.88s)]
*  All you have to do is you put your hands where the rope is so you can get some oxygen. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=755.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=759.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=764.88s)]
*  All we're going to end it with is scolding and all that stuff. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=765.88s)]
*  Well, now, I'm going to see as we got over here... [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=767.88s)]

*  Know there's just [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3585.42s)]
*  Nothing I can do that will make this okay for those it is not okay with [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3589.86s)]

*  because so the reason that they're striking is because [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3601.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like about residuals it's about the AI where they're using like there's a lot of issues right there's a lot of issues and [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3604.9s)]
*  I believe I mean I'm supportive obviously of the strike on both writers and actors [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3612.42s)]
*  With her it's like just that what in her mind did she think that like even if like if I so was supportive [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3618.6600000000003s)]
*  Of her decision or not. It's suicide [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3626.7000000000003s)]
*  Like with Bill Maher too, it's like suicide like just don't work. It's also on top of it, dude [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3629.3799999999997s)]
*  You're a millionaire you can wait a year like I don't have no idea what the fucking thought process is [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3633.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking crazy, dude [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3640.14s)]
*  It's like I don't know dude [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3642.22s)]
*  Well, so what so what is the thought process that they that they just want to still be able to work? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3643.66s)]
*  But it's not we all want to work, right? So then why are they why would they even be able to work? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3648.62s)]
*  I think the justification is like we're like cuz you know there you can do reality shows right now [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3654.1s)]
*  Right those aren't affected. Yes, but he just is hosting. Yes. So spade is you do game shows [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3658.58s)]
*  So in their minds are probably but the problem with that those kind of shows with Bill Maher and her show you need writers for bits [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3662.46s)]
*  Right, they're not improvising it right, right? So it's like and the writers are on strike. Yeah [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3669.14s)]
*  So she's saying I'm gonna go back and do it and we'll just hire my own writers that are not or I'll improvise it Wow [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3675.2999999999997s)]
*  And at that point you kind of just are pot your you have a like if you were not if you were not yeah exactly [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3681.06s)]
*  If you and I had our own show on HBO, which we should but if we had our own show on HBO [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3685.9s)]
*  You and I would have a discussion like yeah, but we just make shit up anyway, so why can't we do it? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3690.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I kind of get that but it's like at the end of the day you and I would have looked at it [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3695.06s)]
*  Yeah, but just it's not gonna look good optically. Yeah, you know me and so it's like no, I don't I don't know [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=3699.46s)]

*  How about this? Yeah, don't say realm again. Okay. All right, it's crazy. But if y'all were in a zoo, let's say that [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4535.1s)]
*  It's a human aliens have created a zoo and there's a white people like a few yeah, there's two aliens in Mexico, right? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4548.26s)]
*  Okay, they created a zoo. I think they can mix you know, I mean different races in a in a [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4555.54s)]
*  Environment. Okay. You're saying to me is is that [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4562.38s)]
*  Aliens would go to the human zoo and go let's go to the Chinese. Yeah [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4565.22s)]
*  You do have to look at Epcot Center. What do you think that? Oh, you're right [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4569.820000000001s)]
*  All right, so what they yeah, you know what dude they would probably have an Asian section [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4573.64s)]
*  Yeah and separate them so they would probably put like [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4578.72s)]
*  The Vietnamese and Cambodians and the Filipinos in one section. Yeah, that's fair [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4582.44s)]
*  Yeah, they would put but I think they would put the Chinese in its own section. That's a lot [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4588.04s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and they were Koreans and Japanese aftermarket to a lot of it [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4592.66s)]
*  What do you mean a lot of that's aftermarket isn't it? What it was after my Chinese they make a lot of aftermarket products [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4596.28s)]

*  Rearview mirror something like that. What would that have anything to do with them being in a fucking zoo? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4606.8s)]
*  I'm just saying that you put them maybe in a special section go on because of the after-market. I'm thinking outside of the oh, yeah [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4610.72s)]
*  You're thinking too much. I am I think the Koreans and the Japanese would have to be separated [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4616.400000000001s)]
*  But I don't know because time has passed [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4621.16s)]
*  But you have to understand the Japanese back in the day did some fucked up shit. Yeah, they invaded China. They invaded Korea [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4623.4800000000005s)]

*  They have a military [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4644.08s)]
*  I think the only kind of gun you can get in Japan is a shotgun and then you have to get a bunch [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4645.2s)]
*  You have to do a bunch of classes and shit [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=4650.36s)]

*  Suggest he will charge because he's saying this the only way you can get rid of bots [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7239.48s)]
*  Is that what he's saying? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7242.639999999999s)]

*  He's saying nobody's gonna pay for all these bots and if and if you have to we can scroll up some [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7259.32s)]
*  Must didn't mention the timing of his plan to charge Twitter users nor did he say how much it would cost [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7264.28s)]
*  I think that's a great idea dude [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7269.44s)]
*  Because it's like people can like, you know, like, you know, I know dudes that like comment shit like dudes. Yeah [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7271.5599999999995s)]

*  Yeah in terms of the language and their aggression. Mm-hmm. You know, I mean, so maybe that's a good way to do it, dude [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7284.0s)]
*  Cuz apparently the advertising sales I guess because he's the CEO people think he's I guess maybe they don't politically align with them [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7289.32s)]
*  They just don't align with them [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7295.96s)]
*  It says 50% [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7298.08s)]
*  That ad sales have plunged. We're still negative cash flow [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7300.4s)]
*  advertising revenue, maybe Twitter will go down like fucking vine I [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7304.4800000000005s)]
*  Don't think it can now why I think you you got to have it stay up if people can just talk on it [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7308.04s)]
*  Where else would people be able to communicate the one I'm joined truth social dog was that we're on is it good? [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7314.36s)]

*  I just wanted to see one more thing that he said here [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7340.56s)]
*  X is other benefits [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7343.16s)]
*  One of the chief perks of X blue is getting verified checkmark, but everybody can pay for their checkmark now I [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7346.360000000001s)]
*  I [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7352.56s)]
*  Think they're saying if there's less if he will pay for it that there won't be as many bots because he's trying to get [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7353.76s)]
*  All the bots off of the app. Oh [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7358.84s)]
*  So can I just see about checkpoints and stuff like that? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7360.84s)]

*  40 dudes were like making a cow yeah with my name [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaRaOyiHek&t=7373.240000000001s)]
