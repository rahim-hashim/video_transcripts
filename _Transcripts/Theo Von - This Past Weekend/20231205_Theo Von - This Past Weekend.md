*  I put those on and I think I'm supposed to sing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=112.84s)]
*  Does that make sense? As soon as they go on it's like check, check, can I get a little reverb? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=116.84s)]

*  Now how high are you guys? How high can you guys get? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=143.84s)]
*  Well first of all, this is well... we were just talking about the highest we've ever been. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=147.84s)]
*  We did it with the same person but separately. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=151.84s)]
*  But I was sitting with... you gave us just enough time to get stoned. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=155.84s)]

*  To the Batmobile. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=165.84s)]
*  I was gonna be five minutes early but then you pushed it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=166.84s)]
*  So we might have showed up sober for the record. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=170.84s)]
*  Hey if somebody's like, hey man we're gonna need five extra minutes in here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=174.84s)]

*  So can I tell the story? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=364.84s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=365.84s)]
*  So me and Luke Bryan were playing golf out at Troubadour and we're listening to some rap and we start talking about jelly roll. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=366.84s)]
*  He was like, y'all known each other for a while. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=374.84s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, we go back. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=376.84s)]
*  Don't act like you're not fighting your best not to do your Luke Bryan impression right now. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=377.84s)]
*  That's so one. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=381.84s)]
*  We got to hear it, man. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=382.84s)]
*  He was like, you've been known jelly rolling. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=383.84s)]
*  That's kind of bad. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=386.84s)]
*  That's kind of bad. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=388.84s)]
*  But I got a good one coming up here because I was like, yeah, I was like, I used to. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=389.84s)]
*  I used to go by his house and acquire some things that we'd freestyle rap. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=395.84s)]
*  And this is like back in 2010. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=399.84s)]
*  I was like, then I went to college and he went to jail. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=400.84s)]
*  And then we came back around all these years later and Luke was like, hold up, motherfucker. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=403.84s)]
*  You better write that fucking song right now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=406.84s)]
*  And so we start I start kind of freestyling in the golf cards. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=409.84s)]
*  I went to college. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=413.84s)]
*  He went to jail. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=414.84s)]
*  One was a dorm room. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=416.84s)]
*  One was a cell. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=417.84s)]
*  Who came out on top? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=418.84s)]
*  Hell, it's hard to tell. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=420.84s)]
*  I went to college. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=422.84s)]
*  He went to jail. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=423.84s)]
*  So we're going to trade it off. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=424.84s)]
*  That's the only thing I'll say. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=426.84s)]
*  So imagine this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=427.84s)]
*  I'm getting a FaceTime or a phone call like every 16 minutes from a drunk Ernest and a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=428.84s)]
*  drunk Luke Bryan day drunk to sun beating all of them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=435.84s)]
*  They're sweating and they're just like, check this one out. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=438.84s)]
*  And I'm like, giving a little input here and there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=441.84s)]
*  And by about the fourth FaceTime, I was like, these cocksuckers are writing a song on the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=443.84s)]
*  golf course right now. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=447.84s)]
*  For sure. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=448.84s)]
*  Over FaceTime with no guitars. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=449.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=451.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=452.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=453.84s)]
*  That's crazy, man. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=454.84s)]
*  I just have, yeah, I guess inspiration can just kind of roll up whenever. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=455.84s)]
*  Is it as easy to just go into place and do inspiration like that and get inspiration [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=457.84s)]
*  like if you're sitting in a room with people or is it, is that a lot easier to find a way [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=461.84s)]
*  to write a song or is it easier just if you're milling around with your boys? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=465.84s)]
*  It can come both ways for sure. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=468.84s)]
*  I mean, in the right room, inspiration is going to be there. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=470.84s)]
*  And just because you're out, you know, having fun and living doesn't mean that the inspiration [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=474.84s)]
*  is going to hit you in that moment. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=478.84s)]
*  But I think, I think living breeds inspiration no matter where you're at. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=480.84s)]
*  I'd like your perspective from a comedian because as a songwriter, we're always writing songs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=484.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=490.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=491.84s)]
*  Like whether we know it or not, subconsciously, you might say something here today that one [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=492.84s)]
*  of us will grab and hit the other one with in a text later. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=495.84s)]
*  You're like, yo, when Bubba said, da da da, there's a song there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=498.84s)]
*  Throw that in the notes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=501.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=502.84s)]
*  It's like, is it like that for y'all as well? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=503.84s)]
*  Like just in day to day life, you're just, there's always, there's, there's always, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=504.84s)]
*  you're always kind of writing a joke, whether you know it or not. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=508.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=511.84s)]
*  I think like if you're running your buddy, sometimes you get them to laugh. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=512.8399999999999s)]
*  You'll write that down, you know, Rodney Dangerfield was a pretty famous. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=515.8399999999999s)]
*  He would like if he was on a shoot or something, he would in his off moments, he would get [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  a big, get in a robe and just hang out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  Like when he wasn't shooting, like literally in a robe and slippers, I think, because he [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  felt real free in it, like his body felt free and he would, he would just write down, he [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  would hang out by people and if something was funny, he would write it down on a notepad [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=536.84s)]
*  and just keep it in his pocket. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=539.84s)]
*  That's kind of like a famous story that I heard. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=540.84s)]
*  I find if I'm like a bot, say like the funniest times I ever am is if like, say if I, if I [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=542.84s)]
*  was like hanging out with a girl, right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=548.84s)]
*  And she stayed over in the morning. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=550.84s)]
*  And I think it's kind of the same thing if you drank all night and you wake up in the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=553.84s)]
*  morning, you're laughing like with your spouse or something or with your spouse. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=556.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=559.84s)]
*  And you're kind of like having just that, that funny time right there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=560.84s)]
*  That's my fun. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=563.84s)]
*  I think that's when I feel like that's your golden hour of comedy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=564.84s)]
*  It really is. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=567.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=568.84s)]
*  Cause if there's a, if it's a lady, you're trying to impress this party. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=569.84s)]
*  That's always like limbically trying to impress a lady. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=571.84s)]
*  I don't know if it's limbic or whatever, but just damn like Mediterranean or whatever that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=573.84s)]
*  Mediterranean part of your head is. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=576.84s)]
*  And you're always just trying to impress a lady. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=578.84s)]
*  So whatever it is, you know, six extra seconds for that to hit me. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=581.84s)]
*  It landed. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=586.84s)]
*  Just moving. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=589.84s)]
*  But yeah, I think that's when I feel like I'm maybe my most engaging or whatever it [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=590.84s)]
*  is with, cause I think as a, as a, a lot of comedies, they're just trying to get a girl [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=594.84s)]
*  to laugh. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=599.84s)]
*  You don't have any way to impress a woman. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=600.84s)]
*  That's when you realize you're young. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=601.84s)]
*  So you're like, I gotta make somebody laugh. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=602.84s)]
*  Or one of these dudes is probably going to fuck me. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=605.84s)]
*  You know, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=607.84s)]
*  I gotta get funny quick. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=611.84s)]
*  I relate as a fat person. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=612.84s)]
*  I always said that you gotta be a little humorous and smell good. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=614.84s)]
*  You can't be fat, stinky and an asshole. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=618.84s)]
*  You can't be fat and asshole. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=620.84s)]
*  Pick two. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=622.84s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=623.84s)]
*  I just gotta be fat. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=624.84s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=625.84s)]
*  Like that's it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=626.84s)]
*  I got to at least smell decent when I can and I better at least make somebody chuckle every [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=627.84s)]
*  now and then. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=630.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=631.84s)]
*  So good. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=632.84s)]
*  Dude. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=633.84s)]
*  And I'll say to that too, not even just girl, but like an audience, like freestyling. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=634.84s)]
*  When we're freestyling, bro, like if it's a car full of people or a studio full of people [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=638.84s)]
*  and the energy is room, like that's, that's when I'm going to black out and be able to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=644.34s)]
*  freestyle, you know, think and just basically be channeling something. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=649.34s)]
*  Cause I know that I can see in real time, like what it's pulling out of people. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=652.34s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=656.34s)]
*  Oh, so like if you're doing like you're just in front of like a group or something. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=657.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=660.34s)]
*  Like you can, you can get a real, real read on site about whether this is cool or not. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=661.34s)]
*  Whereas like if it's just me by myself with music or me and one other guy who's, you know, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=666.34s)]
*  so locked into his thing at the time, then you can get in, you can get in your head and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=671.34s)]
*  get in your own way. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=676.34s)]
*  I feel like. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=677.34s)]
*  I know it sounds weird, but if I had a choice to do it every time, I'd like treat it like [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=678.34s)]
*  a party and us three would be writing a song, but we'd have the homies over there chilling. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=682.34s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=686.34s)]
*  Like some of our buddies, cause you can feel from that, like you just, the energy of a [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=687.34s)]
*  room, but yeah, it's always like, it's also what you're getting into a room writing. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=690.34s)]
*  So fun because there's, I'm sure it's like this for y'all, but there's so many ways to [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=694.34s)]
*  do it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=698.34s)]
*  I've done it so many different ways. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=699.34s)]
*  Now the most crazy way I've ever seen it done. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=701.34s)]
*  I'm sure you don't mind me saying this. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=704.34s)]
*  I had a session with Wiz Khalifa the other night. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=707.34s)]
*  Did you really? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=709.34s)]
*  Listen, man, we as I don't get mad at me. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=710.34s)]
*  I don't know what's supposed to tell this, but you fucking did it in front of me. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=713.34s)]
*  So it's a fair game. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=715.34s)]
*  I think he recorded his verse in reverse. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=716.34s)]
*  So I'm trying to figure out what's happening because like, I know it's going to be hard [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=722.34s)]
*  to even explain to keep them out. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=725.34s)]
*  I've been smoking with for like four hours at this point. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=726.34s)]
*  I'm cooked. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=728.34s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck am I even doing? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=729.34s)]
*  I felt like I'm taking shrooms or something. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=731.34s)]
*  My skin's crawling the room. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=732.34s)]
*  You can't see fucking like yo, oh yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=734.34s)]
*  We as like own skin turns into a maze. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=739.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=741.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=742.34s)]
*  I'm like the fuck is happening? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=743.34s)]
*  You can't even call it a cost. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=744.34s)]
*  You literally need to call like the like whoever was in control, calling poison control for [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=746.34s)]
*  sure. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=752.34s)]
*  I'll let you finish and I have a poison control story. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=753.34s)]
*  He would take the last bar and go backwards. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=756.34s)]
*  So like he would be like, and I'm already gone. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=759.34s)]
*  And then he would go back a measure and loop the beat a measure into that and then figure [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=763.34s)]
*  out what the line going into that was. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=768.34s)]
*  It was the wildest shit I've ever seen. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=770.34s)]
*  I'm not bullshit and earnest. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=772.34s)]
*  He did four bars before I looked up and publicly said loud. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=773.34s)]
*  Is he recording this backwards? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=777.34s)]
*  Like I had missed a whole, he'd done it for 15 minutes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=779.34s)]
*  He might be dyslexic. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=781.34s)]
*  There's not a lot. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=783.34s)]
*  He's versed. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=786.34s)]
*  You just described dyslexia and we're all like, wonder what he's doing. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=790.34s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=794.34s)]
*  Hey, that's funny. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=796.34s)]
*  Bro, you don't see a lot of black dyslexia either. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=797.34s)]
*  Black dyslexia. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=800.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=801.34s)]
*  You don't see it every day. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=802.34s)]
*  Hey, that's funny. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=804.34s)]
*  That's great. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=807.34s)]
*  Tell us about your poison control. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=808.34s)]
*  Let's go take a ride and get some QB bar. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=809.34s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=812.34s)]
*  You don't see a lot of black dyslexia. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=813.34s)]
*  I'm down there at the way sub right now, baby. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=816.34s)]
*  I'll be home in a minute. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=818.34s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=819.34s)]
*  We need more black dyslexia out there, huh? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=820.34s)]
*  Biden? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=822.34s)]
*  No, dudes rapping like Yoda. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=823.34s)]
*  It's insane, dude. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=825.34s)]
*  I've never seen nothing like it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=826.34s)]
*  And it was sick. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=828.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=829.34s)]
*  Dude, if aliens show up, they better show up with some fucking bars or the hoods going [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=830.34s)]
*  to be like, fuck these motherfuckers. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=833.34s)]
*  Know what I'm saying, dude? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=835.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=837.34s)]
*  Tough day to be a square alien, dude. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=838.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=840.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=841.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=842.34s)]
*  Because a lot of black people have issues with aliens anyway, bro. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=843.34s)]
*  A lot of my dudes have told me that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=844.34s)]
*  Have you been hearing that a lot? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=847.34s)]
*  Word on the street? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=849.34s)]
*  Not recently, but I heard, you know, I'm sure it hasn't changed from since when I heard it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=850.34s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=854.34s)]
*  If anything's probably getting worse. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=855.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it was a meeting. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=856.34s)]
*  I don't think it was a fucking meeting. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=857.34s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=858.34s)]
*  But what were you just doing there? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=859.34s)]
*  Poison control. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=862.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=863.34s)]
*  Poison control. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=864.34s)]
*  Are drugs involved in this? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=865.34s)]
*  Not bad ones. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=866.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=867.34s)]
*  Honestly, just caffeine. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=868.34s)]
*  It's kind of insane. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=869.34s)]
*  So before one of these shows, I think we were at Marathon like two years ago. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=870.34s)]
*  And Marathon is a music venue. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=875.34s)]
*  Marathon music venue, okay. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=877.34s)]
*  I probably weighed 50 pounds more than I do right now. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=878.34s)]
*  Just keep that in mind for context. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=881.34s)]
*  I was tired as hell. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=883.34s)]
*  I wasn't drinking at the time. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=885.34s)]
*  So I went to the gas station and got some caffeine pills. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=887.34s)]
*  And it's like four pills and a thing. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=890.34s)]
*  And I get back to the green room. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=892.34s)]
*  I take the four pills and then read the package. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=894.34s)]
*  It was like you're supposed to just take one of these. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=898.34s)]
*  You know, you got four deals. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=903.34s)]
*  That's a recommendation. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=905.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=906.34s)]
*  So I mean, this is like 10 minutes later. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=907.34s)]
*  I finally read the package. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=910.34s)]
*  I go back in the bathroom, make myself throw up. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=911.34s)]
*  And like one empty capsule came out in my puke. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=914.34s)]
*  And I was like, oh boy. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=916.34s)]
*  And I'm starting to get antsy and obviously anxious about the whole scenario. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=917.34s)]
*  I don't have the coolest heart on earth. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=921.34s)]
*  And then I call poison control. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=923.34s)]
*  I call poison control. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=926.34s)]
*  I was like, no brainer. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=927.34s)]
*  I'm going to see what they got to say. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=928.34s)]
*  The guy was like, hey, man, I took four of these caffeine pills. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=929.34s)]
*  I feel pretty uncomfortable right now. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=934.34s)]
*  I'm sweating. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=936.34s)]
*  It kind of hurts. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=938.34s)]
*  And he's like, oh man, he's like, yeah, that's a lot of caffeine. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=939.34s)]
*  He goes, but he was like, if you're in pretty good shape, you should be all right. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=942.34s)]
*  And I was like, all right, thank you. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=946.34s)]
*  And I hung up and I was like, fuck, I'm not in that good of shape. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=949.34s)]
*  Now he's just he's fucking passive aggressively. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=953.34s)]
*  If you're in pretty good shape, I think you should be all right. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=955.34s)]
*  And I'm like, what is pretty good shape? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=957.34s)]
*  I'm definitely obese to an extent. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=959.34s)]
*  Let me draw a picture of myself. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=962.34s)]
*  I'll take it over to you. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=963.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=965.34s)]
*  So I ended up being totally uncomfortable and stayed up all night and sweat. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=966.34s)]
*  But I survived. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=970.34s)]
*  Poison control. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=971.34s)]
*  Dude, yeah. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=972.34s)]
*  Anytime you're just casually calling poison control, that's how fucking weird. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=973.34s)]
*  I'm standing outside the venue kicking it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=977.34s)]
*  Somebody probably just assumed I'm talking to my mom or something. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=979.34s)]
*  I'm over there. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=981.34s)]
*  Am I going to die here in a minute? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=982.34s)]
*  Your PC was good on me. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=983.34s)]
*  You know, that's how I know you went to college because I'd have never even thought to call poison control in that moment. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=985.34s)]
*  I didn't realize I thought that's something you call when like you had rats at the house. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=990.34s)]
*  You would just take two Valiums and be like, yeah, exactly. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=994.34s)]
*  I would feel like this is it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=997.34s)]
*  We'll take a Xanax. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=998.34s)]
*  Yeah, we'll fight fire with fire. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=999.34s)]
*  Yeah, dude, me and my buddy went on a date. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1003.34s)]
*  We were going to pick some girls up for a date one time and we had just taken these like no dose pills. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1006.34s)]
*  Remember those? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1011.34s)]

*  You know, that's what it said on it, right? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1021.34s)]

*  Right. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1270.34s)]
*  And I felt like, no, all pun intended to my boy. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1271.34s)]
*  I felt like Parker had a hell of a year. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1272.34s)]
*  And I feel like Zach Bryan is the second most streamed artist in country music right now [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1274.34s)]
*  behind Morgan. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1278.34s)]
*  So it's like, to me, it was a no-brainer. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1279.34s)]
*  And I'm such a Zach Bryan fan. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1281.34s)]
*  So the fact that I got to sit next to him the whole night, it's so funny. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1283.34s)]
*  I'm glad you were able to, too. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1287.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1288.34s)]
*  That was cool for me and him to get that moment because he was awesome, dude. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1289.34s)]
*  There was a moment where I literally felt like me and him were tailgating and watching [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1292.34s)]
*  a concert outside of an arena. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1297.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1299.34s)]
*  You know, like he's over there drinking. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1300.34s)]
*  I'm ripping a weed pen. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1301.34s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1302.34s)]
*  He's cracking beers. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1303.34s)]
*  There's empty shot glasses. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1304.34s)]
*  It's a panacacy. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1305.34s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1306.34s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1307.34s)]
*  There's empty shot glasses under my seat. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1308.34s)]
*  He's got four or five half-drinking drinks under his. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1310.34s)]
*  Everybody keeps bringing him drinks. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1313.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1314.34s)]
*  And we're just there talking about the music all night. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1315.34s)]
*  And I just thought for sure he would win. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1317.34s)]
*  The last thing right before they announced the name was I think I tapped him on the shoulder [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1319.34s)]
*  and said, say something nice about me or something funny. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1323.34s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1325.34s)]
*  And then whenever I hugged him going up there, I was like, man, you deserve this. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1326.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1330.34s)]
*  And then you looked at him like, don't worry. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1331.34s)]
*  I'll say something nice about him. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1332.34s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1333.34s)]
*  I'll say something nice about him. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1334.34s)]
*  I can do it now. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1335.34s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1336.34s)]
*  But it was really cool. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1337.34s)]
*  Wow, that's so cool. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1338.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1339.34s)]
*  And you've had this a lot in your career, but I was blessed for the first time in my career [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1340.34s)]
*  to have a real viral moment. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1342.84s)]
*  Like, I thought I'd went viral before, but it was like just building to a real viral [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1345.34s)]
*  moment. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1350.34s)]
*  Like, for whatever reason. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1351.34s)]
*  And I didn't touch my phone for like 36 hours after the award show because it was just such [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1352.34s)]
*  a big moment. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1357.84s)]
*  I was just letting it sit, you know, and I didn't want to have my phone on me at night. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1358.84s)]
*  And everybody kept telling me, man, you're going viral. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1361.84s)]
*  And I was like, I'm, you know, I'm like, oh, cool. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1363.34s)]
*  I'm thinking like a couple of movies. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1365.34s)]
*  You're checking your whoop bracelet to see if your doctor's letting you know something. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1366.34s)]
*  Yeah, I'm more concerned. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1369.34s)]
*  That ain't a whoop. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1371.34s)]
*  I wore a whoop this whole tour, believe it or not. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1373.34s)]
*  Did you really? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1381.34s)]
*  I lost 50 pounds on tour. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1382.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1383.34s)]

*  I checked my show. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1386.34s)]

*  You got to be careful. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1394.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1395.34s)]

*  to turn around and say something. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1484.34s)]

*  I didn't realize that I watched the speech afterwards that I actually said that out loud [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1513.34s)]

*  I was bringing Zach a drink each time I came back to be fair. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1886.76s)]
*  Well, who was the other three for, Ernest? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1889.44s)]
*  Me, me and Delaney. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1891.52s)]
*  He would look like a bartender. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1894.52s)]
*  He would have two drinks in each hand. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1896.72s)]

*  Parker McCullough was like, every time I seen him one, he'd have him and his wife one and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1901.48s)]
*  every time he's just walking by. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1905.4s)]
*  It's for safety measures though, because you don't know how long you're going to have to [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1906.5800000000002s)]
*  sit. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1909.4s)]

*  Totally that. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1941.6399999999999s)]
*  It's like when the bell rings and you've got five minutes to get between classes. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1942.6399999999999s)]

*  So I'm calling Ernest and I'm like saying it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=1971.8400000000001s)]

*  And that shit was just tattooed in my brain from the second I left until now. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2086.48s)]

*  than it was when we were growing up? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2576.3199999999997s)]
*  You and I are probably more closer to age and earnest, but I just wonder sometimes. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2578.72s)]
*  I think so. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2583.8399999999997s)]

*  So music used to be curated. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2590.92s)]
*  The labels were in the power. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  And they would curate songwriters. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2595.6s)]
*  They would pick the songs. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2598.14s)]
*  They would make the artists record the songs. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2599.36s)]
*  It was a big deal when artists got to start picking their own songs in this town. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2602.52s)]
*  There was a time where labels were like, this is your song. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2606.0s)]
*  I get in trouble every time I do this, by the way. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2608.96s)]
*  I called it the build-a-bear system. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2612.2400000000002s)]
*  Like Nashville was like build-a-bear. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2614.48s)]
*  They would find a bear. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2616.4s)]
*  They would put cowboy hat on bear, cowboy boots on bear. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2617.92s)]
*  They would give bear a song, give bear a guitar, make bear have a band of bears behind bear, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2621.2400000000002s)]
*  put bear on tour, put bear on radio. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2627.52s)]
*  And it was completely like these dudes were like fucking robots. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2630.6s)]
*  They were muppets, right? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2633.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2634.52s)]
*  For the system and the power. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2635.52s)]
*  And what we've seen in light of the internet, and I always compare stuff to like other things [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2637.44s)]
*  for connectivity. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2642.04s)]
*  In comedy, we've seen it as well, right? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2643.04s)]
*  In podcasting and the ability to y'all to go direct to consumer, right? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2645.52s)]
*  Like the idea that a guy like Zach Brian can be writing songs in the military and sets [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2651.5s)]
*  up his phone and just sweating, just singing his ass off and can connect with people with [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2657.12s)]
*  no in-between, right? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2663.0s)]
*  And that's why sometimes the establishment don't like him because they had absolutely [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2665.02s)]
*  nothing to do with his success. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2668.74s)]
*  But we've gotten to a place where like we're back. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2671.3199999999997s)]
*  The last time this really happened, and somebody's going to argue with me, but fuck them, was [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2673.7599999999998s)]
*  in the 60s and the 70s, the singer-songwriter movement, right? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2677.7599999999998s)]
*  Where you would see guys that were like writing their own songs and singing their own songs. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2682.58s)]
*  Willie Nelson, Waylon, Dylan, James Taylor, their outlaws. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2688.98s)]
*  But I mean, it went over like I was playing, you know, Jackson Free? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2693.74s)]
*  Have you wrote with him yet? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2697.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2698.22s)]
*  I love that kid. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2699.22s)]
*  I think he's going to be, he's 23. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2700.22s)]
*  In the next 10, 15 years, remember we said this name, this kid's going to have 30, 40 [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2702.22s)]
*  number one. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2707.02s)]
*  Jackson Free? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2708.02s)]
*  Jackson Free. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2709.02s)]
*  Spells it with an X. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2710.02s)]
*  I didn't realize how deep Dylan's catalog was. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2711.46s)]
*  Cause like if you're like, I don't know, do you ever get into Dylan, Bob Dylan? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2714.46s)]
*  Bob Dylan? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2717.82s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2718.82s)]
*  So was it the nasal thing that threw you off? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2720.34s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2723.42s)]
*  I just don't know if I, I just don't remember him that good. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2724.42s)]
*  But it's like you've heard some of his songs without knowing, right? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2727.2599999999998s)]
*  Is that him? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2730.02s)]
*  It sounds like Tom Petty. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2731.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, like Tom Petty. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2732.02s)]
*  It sounds like Tom Petty. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2733.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, like Tom Petty. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2734.46s)]
*  Bob Dylan was kind of, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2735.46s)]
*  Hey, Mr. Tambourine man. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2736.46s)]
*  I don't know if that did, he didn't have a song like that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2737.46s)]
*  John is in the basement mixing up the medicine. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2742.46s)]
*  I'm on a page. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2745.46s)]
*  He was kind of rapping. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2746.46s)]
*  Thinking about the government. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2747.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think they- [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2748.46s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2749.46s)]
*  Bob Dylan was kind of rapping. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2750.46s)]
*  But he also wrote along the watchtower, right? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2751.46s)]
*  Like he, like, and Jackson didn't realize this and I'm playing him all these big records. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2753.46s)]
*  I'm like, you know, 10 Bob Dylan songs. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2757.66s)]
*  I could do a few right now where you're like, nah, I don't, I'm like, I play them and you're [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2759.2599999999998s)]
*  like, oh fuck, I do know 10 Bob Dylan songs. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2762.02s)]
*  I just didn't know Bob Dylan wrote them. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2764.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2766.58s)]
*  Because, but it was a different era. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2767.58s)]
*  These guys were like writing their own songs and singing them. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2769.1s)]
*  And then we went through the 20, 30 year curated space. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2771.94s)]
*  And now it's like, there's a lot of guys that are singing their own stories again. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2775.42s)]
*  And that's why I think the connectivity is different. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2779.78s)]
*  And I think the vulnerability shows because it's just men being honest in their music. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2782.06s)]
*  So it might seem a little sadder, but I think it's just more, more authentic. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2786.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2790.38s)]
*  That's a good, that's a great answer. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2791.46s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2792.94s)]
*  For sure. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2793.94s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2794.94s)]
*  That's a good answer. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2795.94s)]
*  Thank you, bro. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2796.94s)]
*  Same as the same with the music too. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2797.94s)]
*  More like not even just the lyrics. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2798.94s)]
*  Like I don't know, pop was so synthesized. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2800.1800000000003s)]
*  It feels like synthetic would be the word, but like now real instruments and like not [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2804.54s)]
*  being so on the grid. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2809.78s)]
*  When I say on the grid, like a Pro Tools session literally locked in on the grid. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2810.78s)]
*  Guys like Zach playing how it feels more so than just everything's got to be perfect. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2815.06s)]
*  And like that just opens up a yard for people that are willing to do it, you know, kind [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2821.5s)]
*  of break the mold and go play in that yard. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2828.46s)]
*  And that's like, yeah, sad songs are going to happen in there. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2831.78s)]
*  I love steel guitar, steel guitars all over my record and there's not a sadder sounding [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2833.58s)]
*  instrument than steel guitar. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2838.2200000000003s)]
*  So I consciously write a lot of times to cater to steel guitar, like what I, you know. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2839.7400000000002s)]
*  I think that to give you your flowers though, outside of the genius, you are as a songwriter, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2846.9s)]
*  as the artist, Ernest, that's what makes you special though, Bubba. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2851.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like you focus not only on the top line and the lyrics, there's a sound that you [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2853.8599999999997s)]
*  want. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2858.74s)]
*  You're bringing like you're years ahead of your time with bringing that sound back around. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2859.74s)]
*  Just like Hardy was years ahead of his time with bringing in the really rock heavy metal [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2863.3799999999997s)]
*  country. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2867.62s)]
*  It's like guys like that is when you think about the guys who really went on to win, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2868.62s)]
*  it's because their sound was so different as well. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2872.54s)]
*  Not just the shit they were singing about. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2875.22s)]
*  Like when I see an Ernest show, it's like nostalgic. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2877.7799999999997s)]
*  But with new concepts written over the top of this super old nostalgic sound. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2883.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2889.14s)]
*  It's just really sick to me. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2890.14s)]
*  And it's the same thing I hear when I hear Hardy like, listen, I bang truck bed like [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2891.14s)]
*  me and Bunny are beefing and me and her, we don't argue at all. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2895.9399999999996s)]
*  It's my best friend. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2898.8999999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2899.8999999999996s)]
*  I love my wife. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2900.8999999999996s)]
*  We don't have any problems, but I still wake up and bang truck bed like I'm fucking ready [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2901.8999999999996s)]
*  to get divorced. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2903.98s)]
*  That song just fucks in every way. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2905.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's because it breaks every rule in Nashville. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2908.1s)]
*  Not just Nashville, but every rule. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2911.02s)]
*  Like he said, there's a system in music, Theo, that's like, okay, and who knows the number [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2912.5s)]
*  system better than me? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2916.54s)]
*  He'll explain this. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2917.54s)]
*  I don't know the number. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2918.54s)]
*  Here's like one, four, five. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2919.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, so, okay, here's the one, I got to go to the four because that's what's [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2920.54s)]
*  supposed to happen next. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2924.38s)]
*  It's like, can't you go to the five? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2925.38s)]
*  It's like, nope, got to go to the four. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2926.38s)]
*  Ernest is like, fuck you, going to the five. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2927.38s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2928.38s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think there's an overall system in the world like that, that kind of like, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=2931.78s)]

*  Something like that. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3501.5s)]
*  But I think those are even evolving. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3502.46s)]
*  It's like what a man is, you know, it's like now a guy is sitting on horseback, but [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3504.18s)]

*  But, but it is cool. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3514.82s)]
*  It, like I was saying about there being a fresh yard to play in as a writer. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3516.54s)]
*  Um, it is way more freeing to write songs now than it was when I first started writing [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3522.02s)]
*  songs. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3526.78s)]
*  And I think part of that is with some success comes more freedom to get to do it. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3527.46s)]
*  But like, yeah, like, you know, the options of guys that will cut songs now are, is [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3532.74s)]

*  you know, so and so over here would never say or never even be able to say that has [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3553.3s)]
*  a little more swag or a little more sauce on it. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3557.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3559.82s)]

*  That's true. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3566.94s)]
*  An artist starts to like collab and stuff that it's like anything could kind of be [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3567.38s)]
*  happy, could kind of happen. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3570.7000000000003s)]

*  It's like, uh, I think about it with, when we were kids, we would go on, uh, what was [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3647.62s)]
*  it, what was it called? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3651.1800000000003s)]
*  Was it called SoundClick? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3651.7000000000003s)]
*  SoundCloud? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3653.46s)]
*  No, no, the beats. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3654.26s)]
*  Oh. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3655.2200000000003s)]
*  SoundClick, I think. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3655.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3657.38s)]
*  What was it? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3657.98s)]
*  So there was a, there was a website called SoundClick.com and it would have beats and [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3658.54s)]
*  it would be like producers would make these beats and they would lease them to you, but [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3663.02s)]
*  they would title the beats like, and this, I dreamed of the day this would happen for [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3666.82s)]
*  me, Drake type beat. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3671.22s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3673.18s)]
*  Eminem type beat. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3674.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3675.46s)]
*  And it was like, that spoke so, it goes back to the sound we were talking about earlier [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3675.7s)]
*  in the pod is like great artists build sounds, not just great songs as well. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3679.74s)]
*  They can build great sounds behind them. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3684.34s)]
*  So like the greatest dreams be like, Oh, that's a John party sounding song. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3686.5s)]
*  That's a kid rock sounding song. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3689.98s)]
*  That's a jelly roll sounding song. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3692.02s)]
*  That's like, that is the greatest compliment because there's a lot of artists in music [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3693.8599999999997s)]
*  on pop and country. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3698.5s)]
*  That's like, there's four artists that could cut the same song because their sound is [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3700.14s)]
*  just that sound. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3703.7799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3706.1s)]
*  It's just a big, it's a big, like, yeah, it's just kind of like down the middle sound. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3706.62s)]
*  It's going to work. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3710.3399999999997s)]
*  People are going to like it, but it's not polarizing. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3710.8599999999997s)]
*  Which, you know, there's artists, you know what I'm talking about? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3714.42s)]
*  And then you have the other artists. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3717.02s)]
*  It's like, Oh, that sounds like J Cole should be rapping on that. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3718.5s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds like jelly roll would be singing a song like that. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3721.82s)]
*  Like that's what you go for as an art and any young artists watching this. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3725.42s)]
*  That's what I challenge you to do. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3729.1s)]
*  I challenge you to write a thousand songs and I challenge you to make production around [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3730.38s)]

*  I was like, is this where we're going? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3934.66s)]
*  I was like, when I met Charlie, it was 2018. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3936.7s)]
*  We were at the Universal Studios, the recording studios, not the Disney world. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3942.26s)]
*  And he's a songwriter. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3947.06s)]
*  There's two people, Charlie Handsome. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3947.82s)]
*  Producer songwriter. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3949.18s)]
*  Let's bring a picture of him up. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3950.26s)]
*  And truly one of the greatest. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3951.42s)]
*  Yeah, truly. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3952.82s)]
*  He started out like a hip hop producer, but like he's one of the greatest musicians. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3953.42s)]
*  Like he plays all instruments. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3958.18s)]
*  He kind of was the first producer to do that acoustic trap stuff, like the early on [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3959.9s)]
*  post Malone stuff, go flex, stuff like that. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3964.1s)]
*  That's his gut string guitar. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3966.82s)]
*  And he does all these crazy vocal effects. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3968.78s)]
*  So anyways, I met Charlie in 2018 when I was like kind of rapping. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3972.9s)]
*  That's, that's one guy is Charlie. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3976.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3979.86s)]
*  The guy on the left. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3980.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's Charlie. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3981.18s)]
*  Those are handsome Charlie. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3982.18s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3983.62s)]
*  I fuck with that dude with four cigarettes in his mouth though. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3984.9s)]
*  But that dude is fucking high. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3987.38s)]
*  Yeah, shout out that guy too. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3989.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's Charlie. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3991.0600000000004s)]
*  But Charlie's a man. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3991.78s)]
*  And so we met doing some rap stuff and we talked that day about, he was like, yo, I [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3992.82s)]
*  got to come to Nashville. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=3999.2200000000003s)]
*  He's like, I want to get into country. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4000.46s)]
*  And I was at that time had a foot in both doors and I was kind of ready to go the [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4001.94s)]
*  country route. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4005.7000000000003s)]
*  Foot in what door? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4006.5s)]
*  Rapping in country? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4007.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4007.94s)]
*  Like that's why I was out in LA, just like making rap beats and doing hooks and stuff. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4008.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4012.1000000000004s)]
*  I was, I was just making the rounds out there and then coming back here and doing [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4012.82s)]
*  country and like I already was boys with Morgan for a couple of years at that time [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4015.98s)]
*  and Sam Hunt and FGL. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4020.06s)]
*  So like Charlie came into town and we started doing tag team and all these sessions [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4022.94s)]
*  together. And that's when like, if I know me for Morgan came heartless for Morgan more [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4026.5s)]
*  than my hometown with them. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4031.38s)]
*  And like it all started happening. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4032.5s)]
*  And my first number one ever was a song called I Love My Country with Floor Georgia [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4034.54s)]
*  Line and me and Charlie did. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4039.18s)]
*  And we just, we kind of sat there and accidentally manifested the whole thing is what we [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4040.8199999999997s)]
*  talked about that day was like, you know, I feel like we could go really organically blend [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4045.8599999999997s)]
*  these two sounds in Nashville. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4050.2599999999998s)]
*  And and it's happened. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4053.18s)]
*  I mean, putting it's not like we're the first ever play 808 with a country song because [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4055.18s)]
*  Joey was doing it with Cruz back when FGL was doing it. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4059.7s)]
*  But I think, I think it's happened. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4062.7s)]
*  I got to give my boys flowers to Zach Crowell did it with break. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4064.2999999999997s)]
*  Zach Crowell didn't break up in a small town. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4066.58s)]
*  He might have been the first guy to do it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4068.22s)]
*  He might have been the first to do it. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4069.82s)]
*  Probably so. Yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4071.1800000000003s)]
*  But so the way it's evolved organically, though, to where it's like it doesn't sound like [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4072.42s)]
*  such a mess. It just sounds like one brand. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4078.1800000000003s)]
*  And then it's the voice that's pulling it home. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4080.42s)]
*  When it's probably getting into people's systems, too, after it gets in their system a [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4083.7400000000002s)]
*  little bit, they're kind of used to hearing it without the frog in warm water. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4086.6200000000003s)]
*  So Charlie, Charlie's Charlie's really one of those special ones. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4089.5s)]
*  And shout out to that crowd to shout out to Ernest, by the way. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4092.86s)]
*  Ernest, Ernest, it's funny how Ernest always finds himself, you know, and he's so humble [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4097.099999999999s)]
*  about his like, you know, this guy, this guy, this guy. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4102.62s)]
*  It's like you always be in the room to motherfucker. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4104.58s)]
*  I know you. I've been with you. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4106.38s)]
*  You're fucking. He's something special. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4107.7s)]
*  I sneak into a lot. Yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4109.3s)]
*  Yeah. Ernest is. I always love Ernest that he's always makes me laugh. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4111.259999999999s)]
*  He's one of the funniest guys to be around. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4115.66s)]
*  Fucking hilarious. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4117.0599999999995s)]
*  He's my favorite face time. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4118.86s)]
*  If I look down at my phone, it's a face time. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4120.7s)]
*  It's worth it. I don't. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4122.7s)]
*  Every time you're like, I don't know what this is, but it's going to be fucking awesome. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4124.3s)]
*  You know what I'm just saying? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4127.74s)]
*  It could be a hit song idea. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4128.9400000000005s)]
*  It could be a hit song idea. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4130.54s)]
*  He could be up fucking partying on his bus at four in the morning. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4131.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He could just have a bit. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4134.34s)]
*  Call with a joke like, yo, check this out. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4135.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like just like I know if Coe Wetzel's on with him on the same face time. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4137.7s)]
*  Yes. I'm going to need to call my sponsor. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4142.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to merge calls with my sponsor. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4146.54s)]
*  The idea of Coe Wetzel makes my liver and nose hurt. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4149.02s)]
*  Hearing his name, I just got PTSD. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4152.42s)]
*  We got to get Coe on here, man. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4154.740000000001s)]
*  Coe is a fucking dude. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4156.5s)]
*  Everybody loves him so much. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4158.9800000000005s)]
*  I'd probably do an afternoon with him. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4160.540000000001s)]
*  He's not awake. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4162.620000000001s)]
*  Unless he's awake, he's hunting right now. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4163.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he has been. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4165.780000000001s)]
*  I just seen a picture of Gary Darryl posted of him and his dad have been out killing shit. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4166.9800000000005s)]

*  He's one of the... [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4173.860000000001s)]
*  His whole crew is cool. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4175.46s)]
*  He's also, man... [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4176.700000000001s)]
*  Shout out Dre. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4177.860000000001s)]
*  Dre is the dude. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4178.780000000001s)]
*  Dre Roca? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4179.900000000001s)]
*  Fucking the dude, man. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4181.179999999999s)]
*  But I'll tell you something else about Coe that I think gets overlooked because he's so fun, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4182.94s)]
*  and the party, and just who he is. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4187.54s)]
*  It's just also, man, he's incredible, dude. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4190.46s)]
*  Like, if you see him with just a guitar... [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4192.86s)]
*  I mean, I've seen him blowed out of his mind. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4195.54s)]
*  Pick up a guitar and just kill. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4198.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like so second nature to what he does. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4200.9s)]
*  He's so ingrained in the music side of it. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4203.98s)]
*  You know, like, we were in a writing room one day, and he was trying to... [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4206.339999999999s)]
*  He was like, no, here, here. He's like, just hand it to me. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4210.22s)]
*  Brantley Gilbert's like that, too. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4212.26s)]
*  And Brantley throw that guitar on. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4213.5s)]
*  It's just, man, I mean, I always... [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4214.820000000001s)]
*  You're a great guitar player in a room. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4216.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4218.860000000001s)]
*  It's like you notice the ones that are, like, different. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4219.42s)]
*  You're like... [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4221.42s)]
*  And I think maybe Coe caught me off guard because I didn't expect it. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4222.14s)]
*  Because we partied all night the night before, like, all night to, like, nine in the morning or something. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4225.700000000001s)]
*  It was like fucking got dark. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4230.38s)]
*  It was fucking deep. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4232.1s)]
*  And I was just like... [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4233.14s)]
*  We got to the studio, like, four the next afternoon. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4233.900000000001s)]
*  We're both, like, shaken. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4235.9400000000005s)]
*  We were both in really bad shape. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4238.46s)]
*  You've been there. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4240.06s)]
*  And it's like... [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4241.06s)]
*  And I'm watching this dude just pour a song out of him. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4241.74s)]
*  I'm like, this is crazy. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4244.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4245.78s)]
*  I brought no value. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4246.22s)]
*  I had to leave. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4247.38s)]
*  I was like, yo, I'm out. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4248.02s)]
*  That's me, dude. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4249.22s)]
*  I feel so bad. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4250.22s)]
*  I'm trying to have sex on cocaine. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4251.34s)]
*  That's me, buddy. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4252.78s)]
*  I'm going to bring nothing to the table. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4253.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4255.14s)]
*  I can't even bring the tape. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4256.7s)]
*  I'm getting this up the stairs. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4257.86s)]
*  I've already sold the table. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4260.82s)]
*  You were talking about somebody like Joey getting to live... [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4262.94s)]
*  A few people get to do it once. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4267.099999999999s)]
*  And we were talking about Tyler Hubbard for a second. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4269.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Tyler. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4271.54s)]
*  I'll tell you a great story about Tyler. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4272.259999999999s)]
*  So I went to... [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4273.339999999999s)]
*  I don't know if this actually isn't a great story, but it is a story. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4274.299999999999s)]
*  And I just realized it wasn't that great. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4276.86s)]
*  But we went to see... [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4280.9s)]
*  We saw Hardy and Morgan in earnest at Fenway Park, right? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4282.58s)]
*  And it was beautiful. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4287.139999999999s)]
*  Like, beautiful day. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4288.299999999999s)]
*  Great set. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4289.179999999999s)]
*  Great place to see a show because you're inside Fenway Park where you've seen baseball, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4289.98s)]
*  but you've never seen a show in there. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4293.339999999999s)]
*  And Hardy's up there with the American flag and Ernest's kid runs out on the stage with him. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4294.98s)]
*  Oh, rhyming? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4300.74s)]
*  Twinkle twinkle? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4301.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4302.54s)]
*  The second he heard a song, though, he's like, I'm out of here. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4303.54s)]
*  He really came and got me. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4305.299999999999s)]
*  He's like, dude, this guy's fucking bonk, right? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  It's his dad. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4307.78s)]
*  I was like, dude, that's your father. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4309.78s)]
*  We have to say that. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4311.62s)]
*  A little respect. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4312.139999999999s)]
*  I need a cigarette. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4313.9s)]
*  He'll be there. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4316.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think you really like the music. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4316.58s)]
*  You just wanted some nicotine. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4317.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4319.259999999999s)]
*  But anyway, afterwards, I'm leaving. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4320.66s)]
*  I'm like, shit, I stayed a little too late to be able to beat. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4322.78s)]
*  Like, like we had to just walk back to my hotel. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4325.34s)]
*  So and it was a way. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4328.099999999999s)]
*  There's probably a half a mile. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4329.54s)]
*  So I'm like, so I get out there and I'm kind of start to argue with this cab driver a little bit. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4330.66s)]
*  He does. We don't. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4336.3s)]
*  We neither want to speak the other guy's language. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4337.5s)]
*  Right. So we're trying to figure out how far I need to go. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4339.34s)]
*  And Tyler pulls right up, dude, with his family. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4343.58s)]
*  Oh, incredible. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4346.86s)]
*  And an SUV. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4347.5s)]
*  You want to get in? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4348.5s)]
*  Yes, dude. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4349.26s)]
*  And I was like, thank you. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4350.099999999999s)]
*  Cruz, bro. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4352.62s)]
*  Cruz. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4353.62s)]
*  I think I think he's going to be one of the few that get to live his dream twice. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4355.0199999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4358.86s)]
*  It looks like it with the songs he's putting out. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4359.58s)]
*  He's a sweet guy. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4361.7s)]
*  Yeah. The hits he's getting on country radio. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4362.74s)]
*  It's always been good to me. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4364.78s)]
*  Yeah. It's been great. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4365.58s)]
*  And I think I told him that one night, I was like, man, very few men in life get to live their dream once. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4367.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think you're fixing to get to do it twice. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4371.74s)]
*  Technically, three times, because then you and BK will get back together later and go do a huge blowout reunion thing. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4373.82s)]
*  And it'll be fucking big again. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4378.86s)]
*  Yeah. What will happen with them? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4381.3s)]
*  Yeah. Can that happen that Florida Georgia line can get back together? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4382.46s)]
*  You think I don't you know, he knows him better than me. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4384.74s)]
*  I just met BK the other day who I think I love. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4387.18s)]
*  OK, they have both always been. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4389.7s)]
*  So they've both always been so good to me. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4392.1s)]
*  Like I said, bro, when I was when I was still snow, they had me come. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4394.18s)]
*  That was your rapper name. Yeah. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4398.7s)]
*  I was just like in Nickname is that era. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4399.900000000001s)]
*  I marked that era like 2014, 2000, 2011 through 2014 was the snow days. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4401.9400000000005s)]
*  And those were like. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4407.78s)]
*  Brian and Tyler had I had no business being in a room writing songs with them and they did in Big Loud and them took a way early chance on me years before I needed it. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4409.98s)]
*  Well, that's another another nod to like people changing genres and thinking of something different, because who would think I'm going to get a white rapper? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4420.86s)]
*  Yeah. You know, or who would think, you know, a lot of guys probably weren't thinking, I'm going to get this a rapper in here to try with me. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4429.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, right. Yeah, it's cool. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4434.66s)]
*  I mean, and then, you know, having having the rapper mentality and then having also signed a country writing publishing deal kind of forced my hand. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4436.0199999999995s)]
*  To just start doing a weird hybrid where I was like, I was really rapping like I would be like doing 16 bar verses like a rap would. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4447.099999999999s)]
*  But I was adding melodies and doing it over acoustic and stuff like that. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4454.94s)]
*  And then, you know, that was just like I said, putting the frog in warm water. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4459.099999999999s)]
*  I was the frog in warm water as far as finally fully committing the brand and craft to like country songwriting. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4463.82s)]
*  And like, I think I shied away from it for so long because I thought you had to be redneck to be country. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4471.78s)]
*  And I'm not the most redneck guy. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4477.9s)]
*  I've done redneck shit with my friends. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4479.58s)]
*  I got redneck friends. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4481.34s)]
*  Yeah, sure. But I'm country and I'm and it took me a while to even realize that because, you know, I didn't grow up on a farm. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4482.42s)]
*  We moved to 13 acres my senior year, which was not because of poverty. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4492.22s)]
*  You know, it's like I had a pretty decent. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4497.02s)]
*  So I shied away from the country things. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4500.14s)]
*  I don't want to be fake. But I some of my favorite songs ever written and got nothing to do with big trucks and mud. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4503.1s)]
*  It's like love or heartbreak and pain. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4509.26s)]
*  And it's like, oh, being a country artist can just be telling your story. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4512.58s)]
*  And the music is my favorite music anyway. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4518.3s)]
*  So like once I wrap my head around that and wasn't ashamed to be country and realize I am country, then I was like, yeah, let's let's go. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4521.34s)]
*  I'm not redneck. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4528.78s)]
*  Well, dude, I'll never forget the first time my mama played Looking for Trouble and I Found a Son right down a barrel of a long man gone. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4529.74s)]
*  Ain't living long like this. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4538.3s)]
*  Ain't living long like this. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4540.66s)]
*  Oh, my baby. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4542.74s)]
*  And I was like, yo, did you fucking country? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4543.9800000000005s)]
*  Who sang that? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4547.74s)]
*  Well, Waylon Jennings. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4548.46s)]
*  It sounds like you. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4549.74s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4550.62s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like that's the shit. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4551.42s)]
*  That's the shit. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4553.86s)]
*  That's what inspired me. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4554.62s)]
*  Right. That was the stuff that I was like, yo, this is awesome. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4555.66s)]
*  You know, it's like that was to me, Willie Nelson's Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4559.78s)]
*  He's like classic record. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4565.54s)]
*  Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4566.74s)]
*  Dude, man. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4568.66s)]
*  And Lucas doing it at the birthday party was insane, too. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4569.9s)]
*  Oh, that's one of my favorite songs. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4573.219999999999s)]

*  Do you think moving forward for you? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4877.5s)]
*  You know, do you think like more about it? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4879.06s)]
*  I mean, do you think like about staying more in a certain lane? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4881.02s)]
*  You all good Ernest? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4885.66s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4887.1s)]
*  No worries. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4887.9400000000005s)]
*  We'll just go a little bit longer, man. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4888.22s)]
*  Do you think about staying in a different lane or doing it? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4890.02s)]
*  Do you have any thoughts like, or is there new stuff you working on or what's? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4892.5s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4895.74s)]
*  I'm actually, I'm actually proud to say this. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4896.22s)]
*  I've got more demos in my phone right now than I've ever had. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4898.22s)]
*  Like I've wrote more this year than I've wrote in a year in a long time. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4901.46s)]
*  I just wrote on the tour this year. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4904.9800000000005s)]
*  Cause I've been gone all year. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4906.18s)]
*  I've only slept in my bed 36 days. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4907.02s)]
*  I don't think we, I don't know. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4908.78s)]
*  We got that on the early part of the song, but I've been gone like that much this [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4909.54s)]
*  year. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4913.58s)]
*  So it's like, I've just been writing wherever I can whenever I can. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4914.06s)]
*  And it's really ignited a flame in me again about the writer side. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4918.38s)]
*  I've been writing a lot of songs just by myself again, just with folks or just [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4922.02s)]
*  oh, by yourself with folks too. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4926.26s)]
*  But I'm doing a lot of just like, not with me falling back. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4927.9400000000005s)]
*  You've been so busy too. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4930.900000000001s)]
*  I bet you ain't slept in your bed 90 days this year. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4932.38s)]
*  No, it has been crazy, but you're touring so unorthodox this week. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4934.42s)]
*  You guys show in two days. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4938.1s)]
*  But see, but we tour different. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4939.74s)]
*  You're doing like the pop. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4941.06s)]
*  I'm going to rock and roll. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4943.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4944.42s)]
*  Rock and roll. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4944.54s)]
*  I'm gone for four months and not home at all. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4944.9400000000005s)]
*  And we go out every weekend. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4947.26s)]
*  You know, we're back Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4949.18s)]
*  I hated that though. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4950.34s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4951.06s)]
*  It stretches it out pretty far. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4951.74s)]
*  Cause you do the weekend warrior stuff too, right? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4952.54s)]
*  I'm kind of sporadic. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4953.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do like four days in a week and then I'll take off a week or I'll do two [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4954.46s)]
*  weeks, four or four days, five days, and then take off for two weeks. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4958.14s)]
*  See what they're doing that I don't like is that's cool. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4961.3s)]
*  That's actually the way to do it probably. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4963.860000000001s)]
*  The way they do it, and I don't like this respectfully. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4965.66s)]
*  Everybody does their own way, but it's not my way. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4968.02s)]
*  They do probably no shit, Ernest. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4970.3s)]
*  You're doing 47 weekends this year if I had to guess. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4972.860000000001s)]
*  Out of 52 weeks. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4975.38s)]
*  Jesus, that's a lot. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4976.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4977.46s)]
*  No, right. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4978.06s)]
*  Well, we 45 at least I'd say. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4978.62s)]
*  We started, we started the first week of March and then pretty much every weekend [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4980.34s)]
*  until this with the exception of when Morgan had to cancel a few shows. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4989.22s)]
*  I got a couple extra weekends off and like we got this weekend off. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4993.26s)]
*  You still picked up some gigs during that? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4995.82s)]
*  But yeah, we filled that up. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4997.18s)]
*  I played a lot of shows. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4998.7s)]
*  So probably 38 weekends. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=4999.38s)]
*  It's like for me, I would never get in the rhythm, Theo. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5001.22s)]
*  It's like when I'm gone that much by the time I came home Sunday and slept Monday, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5004.38s)]
*  I'd get rid of the hangover Monday. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5008.78s)]
*  I'd be like, all right, I'm feeling better. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5010.66s)]
*  Tuesday, I'd start rotating in the world, but Wednesday night at midnight, the bus [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5012.38s)]
*  left again. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5015.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5016.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5016.5s)]
*  So it's like, I prefer to rock and roll style tour where like I just went out and did 11 [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5017.06s)]
*  weeks and did five shows a week and did 55 shows in 11 weeks. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5022.3s)]
*  I never tried another option. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5027.54s)]
*  I've never tried that. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5029.42s)]
*  I don't know if I could hang out. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5030.74s)]
*  I personally, I don't know. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5031.5s)]
*  I think I just get, we just get too burnt out probably. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5032.54s)]
*  How many buses you got now? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5035.82s)]
*  Four? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5036.82s)]
*  No, we did, I guess eight or nine, maybe 10. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5037.62s)]
*  On your tour buses? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5041.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5042.7s)]
*  You got your own. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5043.7s)]
*  Bonnie's got her own. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5044.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5045.42s)]
*  And then we did seven. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5045.66s)]
*  So it was nine. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5046.62s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5047.26s)]
*  You got one bus. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5047.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5048.94s)]
*  I think we did 10 tractor trailers too. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5049.22s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5051.38s)]
*  Big tour. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5051.86s)]
*  I mean, you gotta think we did arenas. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5052.42s)]
*  It was a big deal. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5053.82s)]
*  Your production's insane. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5054.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5055.58s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5056.34s)]
*  And I want, I want to make sure that like, I want to, I'm very a stickler about doing [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5057.0199999999995s)]
*  it right. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5061.74s)]
*  Like if I have to take a haircut and lose a little money, but I know that the show is [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5062.139999999999s)]
*  going to look that much better. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5067.34s)]
*  Like I bought content for my show. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5068.34s)]
*  Nobody buys content for their shows. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5069.86s)]
*  Everybody uses stock content because it costs a million dollars. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5071.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5074.78s)]
*  And I was like, I'm buying content though. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5075.26s)]
*  Like I want to create my own. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5076.58s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5078.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5078.7s)]
*  I want, I want, I know it's a one of a kind show because they're so hard to do one of [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5078.9s)]
*  a kind shows, right? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5082.46s)]
*  Nothing new is under the sun. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5083.9s)]
*  Everybody's done it twice. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5085.139999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5086.38s)]
*  It's like, we all got the same video walls to some degree. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5086.98s)]
*  We only get so much room to play with. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5089.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5091.34s)]
*  And I was like, at least if I create content, it took nine months to build the content [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5091.860000000001s)]
*  for the tour. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5095.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5097.42s)]
*  We're building an animation right now to play. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5097.62s)]
*  We just got some screens and some of these venues. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5099.3s)]
*  I may go back though to just not doing like, we just started doing some arenas this week, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5101.900000000001s)]
*  like some smaller kind of, I mean, the word arenas is kind of loosely, but like a lot [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5106.5s)]
*  of them are like, uh, college basketball places. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5111.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5114.42s)]
*  We call them hockey arenas. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5114.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5116.02s)]
*  And then are you doing Arizona state? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5116.3s)]
*  We might, I don't know. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5119.22s)]
*  We did, uh, Pikeville. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5120.34s)]
*  That was a tough, it was actually a tough room. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5123.26s)]
*  Some of the audio in the rooms is not, we're bringing our own, our speakers and stuff, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5124.82s)]
*  but it's tough. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5129.62s)]
*  Some of it's not built for Verizon. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5130.860000000001s)]
*  Is that the Verizon center or whatever it is right there in Pikeville? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5133.7s)]

*  Did you drive up there? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5146.7s)]
*  We'd bust in. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5148.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5148.9400000000005s)]
*  I drove up there because the drive when we played Pikeville that day, I was like, I had [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5149.18s)]
*  to do it. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5153.46s)]
*  It was fucking incredible. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5153.9800000000005s)]
*  You drive through that little, cause it Pikeville is up there in like the corner of [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5155.5s)]
*  Kentucky and, um, West Virginia, right? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5158.38s)]
*  It's like right there in that little like mountainous area right there. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5161.860000000001s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5164.9400000000005s)]
*  We went for a nice hike before, but that audio was that I felt like sometimes I just kind [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5166.3s)]
*  of felt like that venue, the audio was kind of tough at it. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5169.9800000000005s)]
*  You ever have some of those where some of them you're just like, man, this is, yes. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5172.5s)]
*  And you feel disappointed because you're like, it, it's just, it's just, it's just [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5175.54s)]
*  it, it does. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5178.46s)]
*  It's not helping me as much, you know? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5179.62s)]
*  But, um, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5181.18s)]
*  here's the deal though. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5182.14s)]
*  I knew that you were going to have to start picking up arenas when I was seeing the two [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5182.9800000000005s)]
*  or three theater shows in a day pop. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5186.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5188.26s)]
*  And you're in a weird spot, man, where it's like, how do you feel about this? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5188.5s)]
*  Because the problem you're going to run into, if you don't start playing big arenas [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5191.5s)]
*  is your people, everybody who wants to come, ain't going to be able to come. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5195.38s)]
*  There's still people not getting a ticket to see you and you're playing 8,000 cap [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5198.86s)]
*  arenas. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5202.3s)]
*  There's still people in that market like, damn, wish I could have went to go see [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5203.3s)]
*  Theo Friday without a ticket. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5205.9800000000005s)]
*  You know? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5207.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5207.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5208.7s)]
*  I think, I think part of it is I'll just keep doing the tour and I'll just come [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5209.14s)]
*  back instead of trying to do it. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5212.66s)]
*  That's one nice thing. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5214.46s)]
*  It's like, okay, we realize this area, we could more people want to come see it. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5215.26s)]
*  Then we'll come back. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5219.14s)]
*  I'd rather do the same, like not the same material, but you know, let it evolve over [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5220.34s)]
*  time, but do that for five years. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5224.06s)]
*  And by the end of it, it's a whole new show or, you know, it might be a new show [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5227.02s)]
*  and a half by then, but it's like, yeah, I don't think feeling like I need to [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5230.82s)]
*  hurry and then get an hour out. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5234.98s)]
*  And then it's like, you know, we'll come back. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5236.78s)]
*  I tell people all the time if tickets are too expensive, if it's after, if it's [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5240.139999999999s)]
*  after market, we'll come back. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5243.299999999999s)]
*  Might be a year and a half, you know, you might not be alive. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5244.74s)]
*  Not even before I get back here, but I'll be back. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5247.82s)]
*  How do you, um, if you don't mind talking about it, where are you at with your [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5251.94s)]

*  I love the honesty, but we played Greenville and we had the night off before. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5325.78s)]
*  So what they did was they let us load in the arena the day before. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5329.38s)]
*  And then we rented this place. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5332.82s)]
*  God, they're going to be so mad. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5334.82s)]

*  probably a billion streams this year. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5545.46s)]

*  This song was a double platinum song. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5732.5s)]
*  It's true in an interesting way, huh? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5734.26s)]
*  Because that song I'd heard it. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5735.98s)]
*  I'd listened to it a bunch and it still had its place in my heart in moments [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5737.3s)]
*  where I was by myself and I liked to listen to it, but it kind of, that was. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5740.86s)]

*  stuff, she's like, you want to come in here and sing back and forth? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5756.82s)]
*  I was like, not at all. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5758.78s)]

*  could still help so many people if you would just be a part of it. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5768.62s)]
*  And she was like, yeah, I'm totally in. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5771.86s)]
*  And there's no way that this was a number one in 16 weeks by myself or 20 [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=5773.34s)]

*  halfway out, like I don't know if it'd be a half house or a detox, probably a [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6330.1s)]
*  place where you could also have meetings at, you know, where would you do it at? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6333.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6336.7s)]

*  fucking shows or something that I'll put together and just donate the money or [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6351.66s)]
*  what, like I'm into that in a way you'll never understand. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6355.78s)]

*  Like if you're not, that's why I tell everybody, I'm, don't worry, I'm putting [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6372.14s)]
*  money into this toy drive. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6374.5s)]
*  Like I'm going to write a big check because I'm not just going to be a face of one. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6375.5s)]
*  My face can help bring more attention to it. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6379.22s)]
*  That's the only reason I even talk about this stuff. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6381.18s)]
*  We did philanthropy for years. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6382.860000000001s)]
*  I never spoke about it, but I realized that our platform is so big that we can help [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6384.1s)]
*  bring attention and money to the calls, but it's still important to me. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6387.74s)]
*  My daddy raised me, man, shut the fuck up and cut a check. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6390.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6393.26s)]
*  That's just something I learned from a kid, you know? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6393.78s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's, I appreciate that man. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6396.22s)]
*  And we're going to do the same thing. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6397.86s)]
*  We want to make, yeah, we just want to do something in place. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6398.86s)]
*  I can go to meetings, you know, where other guys can go. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6401.0599999999995s)]
*  I'd be neat where people, maybe we could do a songwriter night where songwriters [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6403.38s)]
*  come by and play some songs with the guys or would be something, but yeah, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6407.219999999999s)]
*  it's a big goal of mine, man. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6411.74s)]
*  It's just so important. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6413.099999999999s)]
*  I just, so many friends of mine and myself, so many people in my own family, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6414.0199999999995s)]
*  just so many people struggling. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6418.0599999999995s)]
*  That's why I think I can feel when you talk about that kind of stuff, you know, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6419.82s)]
*  I know what it's like to not be caged up like by walls, but to be caged up by [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6423.099999999999s)]
*  even just somebody's own, their own life, caged up by their own feelings, you know? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6427.86s)]
*  And when you're just locked inside of yourself, you know, can't get outside [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6432.339999999999s)]
*  of your own head, that's the worst prison. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6435.46s)]
*  I've been to a lot of jails and the worst one on earth is between the ears, man. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6438.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6441.9s)]
*  You know? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6442.38s)]
*  Um, let's, let's, let's check a news thing or two and then we'll get you guys [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6443.9s)]
*  out of here. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6448.5s)]
*  We've, that's the funny part is you just never know where it's going to get. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6448.94s)]
*  You don't really know what's going to happen. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6452.0599999999995s)]
*  I love, that's why I love them. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6453.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6455.66s)]
*  Cause it is just like, yeah, we have microphones on, but this is just [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6456.0199999999995s)]
*  conversation we'd be having at coffee. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6459.139999999999s)]
*  We might not even get this deep over coffee. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6460.98s)]
*  That's what I like about it. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6462.98s)]
*  The moon wouldn't have enough time. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6464.0599999999995s)]
*  We'd be rushing to our next thing. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6465.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6466.219999999999s)]
*  That's what I think's the beauty of being friends now with homies, like [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6466.74s)]
*  having homies like Theo and you that like we have crazy years where Theo's [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6469.58s)]
*  rocketed into arenas. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6473.46s)]
*  I did my first arena tour. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6474.74s)]
*  You came off a stadium tour into your first big theater tour, two nights at the [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6476.419999999999s)]
*  Ryman, you know what I mean? [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6480.62s)]
*  Like all these things you're still writing. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6481.66s)]
*  It's like, we don't get to talk the way we want to. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6483.54s)]
*  So we get to sit down for homies for two hours with a microphone in front of us. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6486.26s)]
*  And it's almost like catching up. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6489.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's really, you know what I'm saying? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6491.22s)]
*  Really? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6492.38s)]
*  It's like, it's really cool. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6492.58s)]
*  It's like, it's deeper than just like what's going on in your life. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6493.78s)]
*  It's like the shit we do on the phone. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6496.3s)]
*  If we had time to, you know what I mean? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6498.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6500.62s)]
*  I realized that one time I left out of Joe Rogan's podcast and, and he's so big. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6500.82s)]
*  He's a super busy guy, you know, and he just is just his life. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6505.42s)]
*  He's built a busy life and he has a busy life. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6508.22s)]
*  He's not too busy for you. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6510.14s)]
*  He just has a busy life and he has a lot of friends. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6512.38s)]
*  And I was like, man, I wish I'd have spent more of that time when I was talking with him. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6514.780000000001s)]
*  Like, because sometimes you think I'm on a podcast, but then sometimes you're just like catching up with a buddy. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6519.34s)]
*  You know, I was like, I need to make sure that I spend that time like catching up with a buddy because sometimes your life is busy. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6523.26s)]
*  And that's all the time you get, especially you also get older. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6529.740000000001s)]
*  You have both you guys have children. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6531.740000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, there's shit going on. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6533.14s)]
*  You know, it's like, so yeah, the time you get with people is just as important, you know? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6535.18s)]
*  And even though it is on a podcast, it's like it's still that's the time. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6539.58s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6542.46s)]
*  That you have. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6542.94s)]
*  I had Cam Haynes flew down here to the show last night. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6543.66s)]
*  Oh, did he really? [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6546.46s)]
*  Yeah, Cam Haynes. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6547.18s)]
*  We were talking about you last night. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6547.74s)]
*  He's Cam Haynes, not the Cameron Haynes. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6549.1s)]
*  Underwear guy? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6552.14s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6832.780000000001s)]
*  But what are you doing for Thanksgiving? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6833.02s)]
*  I'm going to go. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6834.780000000001s)]
*  What am I doing? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6836.14s)]
*  I'm going down to see Dustin Poirier does a fundraiser thing every year. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6836.780000000001s)]
*  They hand out hams on there in Louisiana called the Good Fight Foundation. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6842.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6845.820000000001s)]
*  And so I'm a go down there and do that. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6847.58s)]
*  And then we got to show the day after Thanksgiving. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6849.42s)]
*  At the Lake, uh, UNL where I saw my first concert at UNL Lakefront. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6851.58s)]
*  Really? [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6854.54s)]
*  God, that's awesome. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6855.26s)]
*  Ooh, that are you excited about that one? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6856.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty, I am excited. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6857.820000000001s)]
*  I know that other people, I know that a lot of my friends are excited. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6859.02s)]
*  So I think I'm almost more excited for them, I think in a weird way. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6861.42s)]
*  Like just cause I know they're excited. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6864.780000000001s)]
*  Is it nerve wracking having a bunch of people you know in the audience? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6867.1s)]
*  I think my fear is that they're going to, uh, like yell out and stuff the whole time, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6870.3s)]
*  which for music is fine. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6873.820000000001s)]
*  But like with comedy, you want that, you know, you want people kind of just being more silent. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6874.9400000000005s)]
*  And so you think they just aren't going to know how to act. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6878.700000000001s)]
*  Well, we had a show, I shot my first, like I shot a comedy special in Louisiana one time and [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6881.42s)]
*  people had never been to a comedy show before. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6887.34s)]
*  They don't even have a comedy club like in New Orleans. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6889.099999999999s)]
*  So people didn't know what to do. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6891.0199999999995s)]
*  People were like, there were people in the crowd. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6892.54s)]
*  I remember this one lady just yelling defense the whole time. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6894.62s)]
*  Like, yeah, like she was at a football. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6897.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6900.78s)]
*  Like a bunch of LSU fans. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6900.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6902.0599999999995s)]
*  People had like one of those. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6902.3s)]
*  That's the most rattling. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6904.46s)]
*  That's gotta be. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6906.0599999999995s)]
*  How do you crowd work with that? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6906.86s)]
*  Unreal. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6908.54s)]
*  And I think she even had one of those fence cutouts. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6909.660000000001s)]
*  Man, do you know where you are right now? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6913.580000000001s)]
*  I thought my career was over after I shot that. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6916.3s)]
*  I was like, this is, they have one of the dudes with that helmet with like the two beer. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6918.700000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are we doing? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6924.22s)]
*  Fuck the Packers. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6925.820000000001s)]
*  So that was kind of wild. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6930.14s)]

*  You know, sometimes I make gratitude lists like in the morning, you know? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6937.0199999999995s)]
*  So I'm trying to think of something that I'm thankful for. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6939.9s)]
*  You know, I'm thankful that I don't give up on myself. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6942.3s)]
*  I think if that's something that I had to be thankful for, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6948.38s)]
*  I'm thankful that I don't give up on myself when I give up on myself less than I used to. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6950.78s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6958.86s)]
*  Each day, I'm more thankful for my son, Ryman, and Delaney being the badass she is. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6961.42s)]
*  As much as I'm gone and not able to be there, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6967.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm thankful that I have a peace of mind knowing that everything is good and Ryman is [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6972.14s)]
*  getting the most love and attention and I get home and he's growing and acquiring such a cool [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6977.5s)]
*  little sense of humor and personality. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6982.86s)]
*  And it's like, I owe that to Delaney because she's in there making sure that [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6984.54s)]
*  every little want and need is taken care of and she's on her hands and knees playing [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6989.98s)]
*  trains with him and stuff and paying all kinds of attention to him. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6993.82s)]
*  So I'm thankful for that. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6996.54s)]
*  Amen. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6998.78s)]
*  And trains are damn dangerous. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=6999.259999999999s)]
*  I am track. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7000.299999999999s)]
*  I'm always train track. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7000.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7001.98s)]
*  Shit, I'm your boy. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7002.219999999999s)]
*  I'm not playing chicken with the train. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7003.0199999999995s)]
*  He's playing train with my boy. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7004.78s)]
*  And a guy just got arrested for driving a kid's train smoking meth. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7009.259999999999s)]
*  It's a lot different than when we got a train. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7014.219999999999s)]
*  I was wondering why he didn't call me back yesterday, too. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7016.62s)]
*  His phone died. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7022.46s)]
*  I'm thankful for my relationship with God and my higher power. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7023.82s)]
*  It's really anchored me this year to be present because having such a successful year, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7030.0599999999995s)]
*  it's really like I've never been more present in where I am. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7034.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7038.78s)]
*  Like even in this conversation, I'm more relaxed and laid back now and just more like, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7039.42s)]
*  just being more present. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7045.099999999999s)]
*  I thought I lost my phone yesterday and I realized I think I lose my phone every day now [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7046.46s)]
*  because I'll just set it down and wherever I'm at in that moment is just where I am. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7050.3s)]
*  And then I'll go look for the phone at the end of the day. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7054.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7056.860000000001s)]
*  It's kind of where I've been out of my life and I'm just really thankful for that. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7057.42s)]
*  I'm thankful for my family, my wife, of course, my children, but I'm thankful for my presence [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7060.06s)]
*  because like I've been present around them, but not present. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7065.02s)]
*  I want to get to that point, bro. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7068.860000000001s)]
*  I'm so bad about being present. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7070.46s)]
*  I live in the future and in the past in my head so much and Delaney is so good about being in [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7074.54s)]
*  the present. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7079.82s)]
*  It's like I notice how bad I am at it when I'm with somebody that's so good at it. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7080.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I thank my higher power. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7086.86s)]
*  That's why I thank God because like I truly like that's my anchor. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7088.46s)]
*  That's my meditation. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7091.82s)]
*  It's like my prayer and my ability to just be like today. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtKYsC82g0&t=7092.78s)]
