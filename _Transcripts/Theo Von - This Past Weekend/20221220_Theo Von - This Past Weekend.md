*  On like having a I guess a father figure. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=2433.32s)]
*  Or just like a male role model. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=2436.68s)]
*  And so I don't know I feel like I just lack confidence. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=2438.68s)]

*  You can handle this. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3158.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3160.02s)]
*  And- [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3161.7s)]
*  Dang, that's powerful, dog. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3162.54s)]
*  It is, dude. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3165.02s)]
*  And it blows me away, like no pun intended, you know? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3165.8599999999997s)]
*  I know, bro. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3168.74s)]
*  I know, bro. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3169.98s)]
*  Bro. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3170.82s)]
*  I know. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3171.66s)]
*  But it just like, you know, when you think about it, dude, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3172.5s)]
*  it's just like, it has to be that I was selected. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3174.94s)]
*  Because you figure like, I have a 10 inch shoe [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3178.46s)]
*  and it's probably like what, four inches wide? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3181.82s)]
*  And I stepped on something that's thick as a ruler, you know? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3185.14s)]
*  And I'm walking on the earth, dude. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3189.5s)]
*  What are the odds of that foot landed on that part? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3191.02s)]
*  And I lose both legs and nothing else, dude. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3194.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3197.66s)]
*  I got my genitals, I got my guts. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3198.5s)]
*  I got my mind. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3200.6600000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3201.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3202.34s)]
*  So it's like, how does that happen, dude? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3203.1800000000003s)]
*  And sometimes you gain more than you lose, dude. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3205.1000000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3210.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I can only imagine, you know? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3213.34s)]
*  I mean, it's funny, you know, it's like, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3215.7400000000002s)]
*  we've only spoken with one other person [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3217.7000000000003s)]
*  that's kind of a miracle and it's kind of different. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3219.46s)]
*  I mean, it felt like I got hit by a train. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3221.1800000000003s)]
*  He got trained up. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3222.46s)]
*  But- [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3224.06s)]
*  Yeah, I got blasted. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3224.9s)]
*  Right, but yeah, he got blasted by a train. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3227.1000000000004s)]
*  And he said he wanted to, he's ready to run it back, baby. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3229.46s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3232.26s)]
*  Like he said that there's some, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3233.1s)]
*  I think there's a greater currency in existence [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3235.82s)]
*  that we can't really put our hands on. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3242.3s)]
*  I think as Americans, we've gotten far away from it [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3245.86s)]
*  with our society. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3248.5s)]
*  It's better, you know, in some ways, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3249.7s)]
*  we've taken a detour in some ways. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3251.1s)]
*  There's some currency that we don't really know. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3253.14s)]
*  Sometimes we can feel it [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3256.38s)]
*  and some people get closer to it. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3257.66s)]
*  And it feels like some of that maybe [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3259.9s)]
*  is what you're talking about. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3262.42s)]
*  But yeah, man, so- [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3264.7s)]
*  So you walk- [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3265.8599999999997s)]
*  July 15th. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3266.7s)]
*  Go on. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3267.54s)]
*  So July 15th, 2010, we were in Marjah, Afghanistan. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3268.38s)]
*  It's in the Helmand province. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3275.7799999999997s)]
*  And that particular, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3277.42s)]
*  I'll just talk about that particular day [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3278.8199999999997s)]
*  because I mean, we could be on a whole podcast [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3280.22s)]
*  and talk about the whole deployment. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3282.18s)]
*  But I was only there for like two and a half weeks, man, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3283.8599999999997s)]
*  of full combat operations. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3286.5s)]
*  And we were just walking through the way it was designed, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3288.74s)]
*  man, it was, if you can imagine, like a cornfield. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3294.66s)]
*  But it's not corn, it's like opium, dude, or not. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3300.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's opium and weed. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3303.5s)]
*  And they're growing the dark arts over there, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3305.42s)]
*  if you know what I mean. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3307.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3308.7s)]
*  And we just, I cross over these two little fields [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3309.82s)]
*  and my buddy, Andy Powell says, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3317.7799999999997s)]
*  from what I can remember, he says, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3321.58s)]
*  oh, there's an indicator, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3323.14s)]
*  a little piece of cloth or whatever. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3326.9s)]
*  I still don't even know what it was really, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3329.5s)]
*  but he said there was an indicator. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3331.06s)]
*  So he holds his own patrol. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3332.98s)]
*  And we started, we took a, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3335.94s)]
*  and obviously I was the closest one to the junction. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3339.66s)]
*  So I was like, me being a Sergeant of Marines, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3342.62s)]
*  I was just like, hey man, I'm not gonna ask someone else [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3344.58s)]
*  to go do the heavy lifting. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3348.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3349.54s)]
*  Like if you're gonna be a leader, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3350.38s)]
*  you gotta shovel shit too, you know? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3351.22s)]
*  And what's the junction? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3353.74s)]
*  When you say a junction, what does that mean? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3354.7799999999997s)]
*  So there was two properties joining together [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3356.98s)]
*  and they were separated, thanks man, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3362.5s)]
*  they were separated by little canals. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3364.14s)]
*  There was two canals, you know what I mean? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3368.7s)]
*  So I had to cross over both of those to go back [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3370.06s)]
*  and look at, you know, looking for, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3374.1s)]
*  at the time we were finding like, you know, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3376.46s)]
*  sniper positions, we were finding machine gun positions. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3379.38s)]
*  The IED threat, the bomb, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3383.2599999999998s)]
*  the improvised explosive device threat was like in the trees. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3385.42s)]
*  Well, we got intel that they would be putting them [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3389.54s)]
*  in the trees. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3391.1s)]
*  So I was looking all over the place, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3391.94s)]
*  but I wasn't necessarily looking for an IED on the ground, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3393.54s)]
*  you know? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3396.94s)]
*  And so there was 11 guys, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3399.1s)]
*  I was number 11 in our little stick, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3401.42s)]
*  our little formation, our line. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3403.9s)]
*  And then I was number 12 when I crossed over to again. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3407.58s)]
*  And then on the 13th time is when it, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3411.46s)]
*  I remember looking down and I remember like the, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3416.9s)]
*  the light from the kinetic energy of the blast [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3422.9s)]
*  just like enveloping me in. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3425.8599999999997s)]
*  And then I felt all the little pebbles on my face. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3428.66s)]
*  And I remember like making the little sound [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3432.3399999999997s)]
*  of just stepping on that bomb, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3434.62s)]
*  the little sound that I made, it was like a, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3436.18s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3440.02s)]
*  And then, well, what made it, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3441.2999999999997s)]
*  what confirmed it that I was, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3444.66s)]
*  I was the one that got hurt was, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3446.54s)]
*  it shot me straight up in the air. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3448.5s)]
*  And I saw my shadow from an aerial view on the ground. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3451.42s)]
*  No way. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3454.46s)]
*  And I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me, dog. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3456.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm it, I'm the, I tag you're it. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3459.02s)]
*  Damn. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3461.2200000000003s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3462.9s)]
*  And so. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3464.46s)]
*  So you could see, so the sun, you were blocking, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3465.34s)]
*  you could see your shadow and you're like, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3467.7400000000002s)]
*  oh my God, this happened to me. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3468.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3471.6600000000003s)]
*  And so you were able to have that thought, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3472.5s)]
*  you were able to have that conscious thought, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3473.6600000000003s)]
*  oh my God, this happened to me. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3474.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3476.26s)]
*  100%, yeah, man. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3477.1000000000004s)]
*  And then I landed on my face. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3478.7000000000003s)]
*  And I remember like, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3481.78s)]
*  I remember taking out the dust out of my mouth, dude. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3482.7s)]
*  And I remember just immediately thinking about my friends [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3485.5s)]
*  being like, dude, I don't want, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3490.7799999999997s)]
*  I wanna be strong for them. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3493.8199999999997s)]

*  there were a few where I felt guilty [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3945.66s)]
*  for going to Christmas or having Thanksgiving [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3948.22s)]
*  because my buddies who are dead, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3952.66s)]
*  they don't get to have that opportunity anymore. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3954.98s)]
*  You know, I felt guilty falling in love with my wife [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3957.02s)]
*  or being intimate with my wife, you know, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3961.02s)]
*  or holding my kids, kissing on them and loving on them. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3964.54s)]
*  And being like, my boys never get to do this. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3967.34s)]
*  Some of the dudes that got killed were fathers, bro. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3969.38s)]
*  And their kids, that's it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3972.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3973.82s)]
*  And I think about that stuff all the time, you know? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3974.66s)]

*  I had to figure out, sometimes, dude, like, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3981.14s)]
*  sometimes it's easier to know how to live when you, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3985.1s)]
*  sometimes you're so hurt and you're like, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=3991.94s)]

*  Air quotes, hangups, or my disability, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4008.46s)]
*  air quotes, disability, look like something [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4012.66s)]
*  to where my kids can't experience Disneyland. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4017.3s)]

*  the loud fireworks freak me out, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4024.78s)]
*  the mass group of people freak me out, you know, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4026.82s)]
*  I can choke it down because looking at them, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4029.9s)]
*  they can ground me because they're smiling. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4033.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, if I'm living for my friends that got killed, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4036.62s)]
*  sometimes it's easier. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4040.58s)]

*  when you can't live for yourself to be unselfish enough [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9g-9bazkf4&t=4175.5s)]
