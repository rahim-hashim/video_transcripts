*  I was fucking lost. I was like, you know, what I was trying to do was honestly, was just figure out [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=286.8s)]
*  what happened the last 30 years after the pen. When the pandemic hit, we were all gung-ho. We were very [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  all gung-ho. Oh yeah. But like by May of the pandemic, I was like, what the fuck happened? I came [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=301.28000000000003s)]

*  something that you'll never ever see again. I still remember I would do spots and then go to the kitchen [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=323.0s)]
*  after my spot and just sit for a minute and look out into the bar area and stuff. And it would be [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=328.24s)]
*  like celebrities, MMA people, the Clippers. You know, it was something every night. It was just too [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=335.6s)]
*  overwhelming. Every time you left the store on Tuesdays or Thursdays, you got in your car and you [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=343.0s)]
*  had to fucking drive 30 minutes just to be compressed. Dr. Dre was hanging out that night [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=349.76000000000005s)]

*  you know, hard to believe. We had our own fucking thing. Kennison, Dice, those guys had their thing [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  and we had our thing. It's really true. I didn't realize it either until I went back, like over the, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=366.44s)]
*  I've gone back over the past two years and it's like, it's not even, it's not even the same thing [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=372.32s)]
*  anymore. It was like a, it was like lightning striking when everybody was there. Dude, the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=378.24s)]
*  lineups sometimes like on a Tuesday night. I still have them. I saved everything. I would clip a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=384.36s)]
*  lineup. I would take a picture of it or something and go, this is where you were with these guys. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=391.44s)]
*  I want to see somebody try to take something away from me. Like, do you know what I'm saying? Like [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=397.36s)]
*  people always go, whoa, he didn't do it. Listen, bitch. And this is these lineups in 2019. What [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=402.24s)]
*  about the lineups? Well, 2009 I wasn't there, but in 99 I was there. And I remember looking at those [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=409.72s)]
*  lineups and they weren't good, but you had fucking animals, like three of them there on the lineups. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=416.8s)]
*  It wasn't like nine motherfuckers coming at you. From Ali Wong to you to Deleah. It was a calvocade [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  every Tuesday and Thursday and everybody got along. Whitney, you, Burt, Joe, Segura, fucking Tripoli, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=431.0s)]
*  Brennan, Eddie Bravo, Owen Smith. It was fucking crazy what was down there. They had MMA fighters that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=440.04s)]
*  weren't even comedians fucking doing 20 minutes down. It was fucking crazy. Eddie Bravo was doing like [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=449.0s)]
*  40 fucking minutes, bro. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=455.68s)]
*  Fucking crazy. You think about it. And people walked in there and it's like they got high. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=457.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=464.68s)]
*  Soon as people walked in there, it's like walking into the mothership. You know, you walk in and you're just taking. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=465.68s)]
*  You're just taking. And this is, you know, I didn't do it for one summer. I did it for 30 fucking years. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=471.68s)]
*  So now I got to figure out where they took me. Yeah. You know, where the fuck did they take me? I mean. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=476.68s)]
*  Yeah, just to look at that lineup and be like, it doesn't even feel like you're really the person doing it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=481.68s)]
*  No. You ever see Oh God, You Devil, any of those Oh God movies? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=486.68s)]
*  Is it like a black movie or not? No, no, no. George Burns. Oh, yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=490.68s)]
*  Praise God. And he fucks with people. Yeah. You got the Coke bottle or whatever. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=494.68s)]
*  And it's really weird. Yeah. Those things. They're fucking. One of the guys he went to, I'll never forget. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=498.68s)]
*  Like I this is way before I got into comedy, way before I got to comedy. I started watching, you know, I like movies. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=505.68s)]
*  And there was one particular guy that the guy was a musician and he was struggling and he was like a Bruce Springsteen type guy. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  And then he came to him and he fucking shut out the light because he was the devil. He plays the devil. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, he plays the devil. He's got to deal with you to sell your soul. Oh, God, You Devil. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  I remember the gods must be crazy. Was that him? No, no, that's OK. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=530.68s)]
*  That's why you're getting confused with the Africans and stuff. Yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=533.68s)]
*  But it was that's what I feel like the guy during the movie after he became the star. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=536.68s)]
*  He would go, what the fuck? What the fuck? And then he would go to a restaurant after he knew the devil took his soul. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=542.68s)]
*  He would go to a restaurant and see the girl he was engaged with. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=551.68s)]
*  And now she was about to have a baby. And this was his life. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=554.68s)]
*  Like, it's fucking crazy. And that's what I felt like. Yeah. A lot of times like, did I just do that? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=559.68s)]
*  Why do people want to take a picture of me? I'm a felon. Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=565.68s)]
*  Did your mother told you to stay away from people like me? You want to take a picture of me? And it was just mind boggling. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=568.68s)]
*  So that was the first year in Jersey. It was just. Come on, figure out coming down. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=574.68s)]

*  and started going to softball games and basketball games with my daughter. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=590.68s)]
*  Were you playing or you were just coaching or what? I don't even coach. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=595.68s)]
*  I just sit there. I get high and I sit there and watch. Oh, yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=598.68s)]

*  It really hurt in the beginning for years. It really took me part of the addiction and all that shit was that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=655.68s)]
*  And then I made peace with it. I knew that this wasn't going to work. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=662.68s)]
*  This wasn't going to work. It wasn't in the cards and you got to move on. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=665.68s)]
*  Then I had this thing. God gave me a second chance. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=668.68s)]
*  And they threw another girl at me and I'm like, what am I going to do here? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=671.68s)]

*  Just get I got a second chance to do this the right way this time. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=680.68s)]
*  And this is what I'm going to do. Did you? And that was a real thought in your head. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=683.68s)]
*  You're like, I got this. This is God giving me a second chance. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=686.68s)]
*  Fuck yeah. Yeah. You know, I've gotten deal. How many second chances have I fucking got? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=689.68s)]
*  Got a decent amount. So some second chances you've got to jump on and go, you know what? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=693.68s)]
*  This ain't going to happen again. Yeah. I can make peace with myself. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=698.68s)]
*  You know, I heard things. I wasn't a good dad. I heard tons of shit from my ex-wife. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=702.68s)]
*  And now I'm living it. You know, now I'm living. I got a nice house, cars, you know, we don't. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=707.68s)]
*  I'm not a jet setter. You know that I'm not a BMW guy. I'm just happy and comfortable. Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=713.68s)]
*  You know, I retire in four fucking years. My daughter collects Social Security for three of those years. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=719.68s)]
*  The ones I didn't get when my mother died. So everything comes full fucking circle, man. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=724.68s)]
*  Oh, really? So Social Security, you get it for how long? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=730.68s)]
*  So when my mother died, I didn't get Social Security because they said she didn't work enough quarters. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=733.68s)]
*  She owned a business. So I had no money coming in when I was a kid, you know, for all those years. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=738.68s)]
*  And it's weird now. I got a letter about six months ago about retiring and all this shit would benefit. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=744.68s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want to retire. I want to keep slinging dick. I feel great to go out there. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=750.68s)]

*  It's a young man's game. But it's a really it's not even that you can't do it. It's just can you put up? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=761.68s)]
*  It's like the stress it just wears on you. You know, you did it for so long. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=766.68s)]
*  And we'll forget I'll forget sometimes Joey how long I did this shit for. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=771.68s)]

*  I love that movie. When I saw him, I was crying up a storm. The funny thing was I got in trouble for that movie. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1010.68s)]
*  Listen to this. I'm at the longest yard premiere. What? The longest fucking yard premiere that you're in. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1016.68s)]

*  The producers from the longest yard are sitting in front of me. And I turn to fucking Russell and I go, yo, that's the fucking movie of the year right there. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1071.68s)]
*  And he looked at me and the producers looked at me. I'm supposed to be pushing the longest yard. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1081.68s)]
*  But I'm telling him this is the fucking movie of the year. Cinderella. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1085.68s)]
*  And he started laughing his ass off. You're from North Bergen. We started giggling. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1089.68s)]
*  And then because my friends told me when he was shooting the movie, they would see him at different delis. He was doing different delis around fucking town. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1093.68s)]

*  The fight they get might have been the first time I came on on you guys this podcast. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1221.68s)]
*  And and in the beginning there was something in the headphones. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1227.68s)]
*  It was like, Lee, I'm hearing like a little like a sound in the headphones. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1233.68s)]
*  He's like, I'm trying to fix it. I think he was like looking on his phone trying to be like the whole board is in front of whatever. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1236.68s)]
*  Fast forward two hours. I think we did some mushrooms or something. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1246.68s)]
*  Lee is unconscious or semi unconscious. I don't want to say he was unconscious, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1251.68s)]
*  but he wasn't associated with you and me. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1255.68s)]
*  And we were the only people in the room. So he's over there and he's like, and I I hear this sound in the headphones again. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1258.68s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, this time it was him making like a wheezy. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1266.68s)]
*  He had like some HVAC issues going on. That motherfucker. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1272.68s)]
*  That was the thing that really killed me. I got to be honest. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1277.68s)]
*  Like if you hit a popcorn bag, that's been fucking good. That's cooked to the max. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1280.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's what he sounded like. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1284.68s)]
*  That's when that first like kind of what killed you. Sorry, I interrupted you. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1287.68s)]
*  No, no, no. You know what fucking killed me, man? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1291.68s)]
*  Those those eight years of that podcast with Lee, that was rough. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1293.68s)]
*  Like I didn't know how rough it was till I stopped doing it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1299.68s)]
*  Like, what do you mean keeping up every week by having a party every week? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1302.68s)]

*  You were building a house? No, the house wasn't. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1355.68s)]
*  We couldn't move until September 2nd. Oh, yeah. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1358.68s)]
*  So we had two weeks in corporate housing. Those two weeks were like I was just driving my wife crazy. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1360.68s)]
*  Yeah. Because I was eating three thousand milligrams a day. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1367.68s)]
*  I was bored. I was lonely. It was a pandemic. Oh, yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1371.68s)]

*  And I'll never forget I went back there and I got so high one night, I melted the tea kettle. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1382.68s)]
*  Because I used to make Michael Jackson tea at night. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1389.68s)]
*  Like I'd make like edible tea and put two thousand milligrams in there and that's sleepy time. Yeah. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1392.68s)]

*  Yeah, I feel you. The fucking whole night I made that shit and I was like, I'm not high enough. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1402.68s)]
*  I can't believe you even said that to yourself. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1409.68s)]
*  Like it was like like the first month in Jersey was a fucking like I wasn't high enough. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1412.68s)]
*  So I went to make another batch of tea and I passed out. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1417.68s)]
*  And when I got up like two hours later, the fucking steam thing, the cheese ran out of water and just fucking collapsed into a little metal thing. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1420.68s)]

*  And did you know what you wanted to do at that point? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1491.68s)]
*  Or were you thinking like, I don't know what I want to do, because I remember there was a point right when the pandemic happened, right? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1493.68s)]
*  After like 30, 40 days and not be having to do comedy. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1498.68s)]
*  First, I'm like, I'll take a little break. It's great. It's great. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1502.68s)]

*  I never made a choice what I wanted to do. I made a choice 20 years ago. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1508.68s)]
*  And now I'm just still doing that choice. I don't even know what I want to be doing. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1512.68s)]
*  So there was a time I was like, I don't even know what I'm, you know, what's going on. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1515.68s)]

*  Because he looked like Don Flamenco. Remember Don Flamenco from Mike Tyson's Punch Out? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1778.68s)]
*  This guy was the first homosexual that everybody knew in our area. And he also was a pride. Billy was a fighter too. He grew up boxing. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1784.68s)]
*  And then, so he would get the one with the rose in his mouth that looks more like him. There you go. That's Billy right there, bro. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1791.68s)]
*  Okay, so he fucking goes, Dio, bro, I'll give you a couple somas. You drive me across the lake, bro. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1800.68s)]
*  I was like, all right. I've never taken somas in my life too. So I took two of them bitches, dude. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1806.68s)]
*  He went into the service station to get a prepaid phone card or something because he has some domestic issues. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1813.68s)]
*  So he comes back out, bro. And I fucking, it only been about 12 minutes of taking them bitches. We start driving, dude. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1820.68s)]
*  I took a right turn and the place didn't even exist, bro. The road didn't even exist, bro. Right into the ditch, dude. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1827.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1834.68s)]
*  Bro, he fucking takes my body and moves me over to the passenger seat. The cops came. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1835.68s)]
*  He went to jail for like four months, dude. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1841.68s)]
*  So he's switching it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1845.68s)]
*  Oh, fucking G, bro. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1846.68s)]
*  Bless his heart because he knew he put me in that situation. I was a child. He was like an adult, bro. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1849.68s)]
*  But it was I was just trying. But who gives their driver fucking two somas, you know? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1854.68s)]
*  So just poor pill management, really. But poor pill management. Yeah, it is. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1860.68s)]
*  But damn, that was something, dude. God. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1865.68s)]
*  When I think of some of the times, dude, it scares you. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1868.68s)]
*  Yeah, when I think of the times that I drove fucked up, Joey, when I used to get I would put both of my feet on the pedals, right? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1873.68s)]
*  Because I was too nervous to let one of my feet make all the decisions, right? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1881.68s)]
*  So I was like, I ain't trusting this one of my feet. I'm gonna have both feet down there in case something pops off, right? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1885.68s)]
*  So I had one on each pedal. But even then, it's like playing a you know, it's a little bit of driver's ed kind of vibes. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1890.68s)]
*  And I would be like in a crosswalk and I would be high and somebody would be walking through and I'd be like, do not fucking hit the gas, bro. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1897.68s)]
*  Just hoping my feet didn't do their own shit and start a new adventure for themselves. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1904.68s)]
*  You know, just got me so just just being so fucked up that you didn't know if you were going to be able to rely on yourself. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1908.68s)]
*  You know, that shit was tough. That's one thing about me. I never fucking did. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1915.68s)]
*  As crazy as I am, I could do anything. Like if you said to me, Joey, can we do this? Let's go. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1919.68s)]
*  I'm not scared of cops. You know, when I was running, I was running. OK, when you're running, you're running. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1925.68s)]
*  There's one thing I hate doing. Drinking and driving. Yeah. Or partying and driving. Listen, I could smoke a joint and drive better than most people. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1930.68s)]
*  The other shit, I cannot drink and drive. It won't let me. My body shuts down because I know I could talk to a cop. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1940.68s)]
*  But if I'm drinking, I can't talk to him because he's got me. I'm guilty. I'm guilty. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1948.68s)]
*  I'm not going to fucking try to tell him I have one drink. That's why I won't even have one drink when I go out. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1953.68s)]
*  The fear of a cop pulling me over and asking me, were you drinking? Yeah. And then I got to go. Yeah. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1958.68s)]
*  And then he gets me out of the car and then I got to do the fucking 10 steps. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1964.68s)]
*  So before I go through all that shit, you know, and we didn't have ubers. You know, I didn't have an Uber. Now, great to get high. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1967.68s)]
*  Yeah, you could do whatever the fuck you want. Now. Yeah. People don't understand what that was like. Not having an Uber. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1975.68s)]
*  You had to get high. Say if you wanted to leave a place, you had to fucking walk or fucking run or fucking go through the weeds or some shit. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1980.68s)]
*  You know, my thing was I'm still very grateful that in all those years, nothing happened bad on the road. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1989.68s)]
*  And, bro, I was in situations where, you know, a lot of shit could have happened drug wise. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=1997.68s)]
*  One time in Beaumont that like when I think of nights that I could have died, it's Beaumont. Beaumont for reals. I fucking OD'd on Valium. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2005.68s)]
*  Really? You can OD on the sunset there. It's a beautiful area. I couldn't talk for three days. I had to go to a hotel room. My face was dragging. It's like I had a ballsy face. Yeah. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2015.68s)]
*  Couldn't go home. Couldn't get on a plane. I blew my ho check in a hotel in Houston fucking coming down hiding from people. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2026.68s)]
*  Drinking Gatorade, bro. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2033.68s)]
*  You know, yeah. It's so many things could have happened. All those weeks in Miami doing drugs. Houston. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2035.68s)]
*  You know, Houston was fucking, you came to Houston to lose your mind and do comedy. That was part of it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2043.68s)]

*  That's a fucking... I had a friend... well, he wasn't a friend. When I was like 24, there was an old guy that hung out at one of the bars. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2174.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2181.68s)]
*  And he would just drink and then throw punches in the air. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2182.68s)]
*  And say, you talking to me? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2185.68s)]
*  And he would throw punches, you know. You know the whole fucking thing. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2186.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2190.68s)]
*  So I'm doing coke in this bar and every day he'd talk to himself and, yeah, I'll fucking kick your ass. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2191.68s)]
*  And he'd throw jabs. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2196.68s)]
*  And one day I asked the bartender, what's up with this fucking guy? He goes, you don't know Johnny Reed? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2197.68s)]
*  I go, nah. You know, it was 1984. I'm a kid. I don't know Johnny Reed. He goes, I go, is he crazy? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2201.68s)]
*  He goes, you don't know what he did? I go, nah. He goes, he tried to kill himself, jumped out of a building and landed in the garbage dumpster. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2206.68s)]
*  And he just bopped his head. So now he's fucked up. He would get a check from the government on the first and he would just give it to the bartender and say, tell me when it's over. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2213.68s)]
*  By the 18th, he'd be broke and he'd be in there fucking arguing with the bartender. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2223.68s)]
*  I locked him in the bathroom one day. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2228.68s)]
*  Doug, I locked him in the bathroom at 2.30 in the afternoon. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2230.68s)]
*  Because in Jersey, the bathrooms locked from the outside. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2233.68s)]
*  He was driving us crazy talking about boxing. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2236.68s)]
*  1964, I took him to the body and we're like, Johnny, knock it off. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2238.68s)]
*  He went into the bathroom. I can't take Johnny no more. We locked him. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2242.68s)]
*  We left. We leave. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2245.68s)]
*  Oh, you got to. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2247.68s)]
*  I came back at nine. I go to the bathroom. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2248.68s)]
*  He's still in the bathroom locked. He came out. He's like, whoa, that's the noise he made when I opened the door. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2250.68s)]
*  He goes, whoa. This guy used to fuck me like we give him up. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2255.68s)]
*  Then towards the end, I go, Johnny, you ever do coke? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2259.68s)]
*  Yeah, I give him a line of coke and that would put his empiricism, whatever craziness he had, he'd go even worse. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2261.68s)]
*  And I still remember giving him a line of coke like at two in the morning, like a bump. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2268.68s)]
*  And then being in the car at five, going to the city to get coke and seeing him walking over the George Washington Bridge, throwing fucking laps. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2272.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, we can't give that motherfucker lines no more. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2280.68s)]
*  And then I cracked him one day. I just showed him my dick. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2284.68s)]
*  I put it on the stool next to him. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2287.68s)]
*  And he was right on the stool and he's like, and I go, Johnny. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2289.68s)]
*  He goes, what? And I go, look at this. And he goes, wow. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2291.68s)]
*  And he just fucking, he just watched the basketball game. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2295.68s)]
*  Wow. He just fucking dying. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2298.68s)]
*  Only Johnny could do this. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2301.68s)]
*  I've been asking about him. What happened to him? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2303.68s)]
*  He's got to be dead by now. He was 50, 60 when that shit in the 80s. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2305.68s)]
*  Dude, we had a guy, we had this dude, Mr. Dennis, and everybody just called him Danny, right? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2309.68s)]
*  This guy in our neighborhood. He kind of like he was just like an adult, right? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2314.68s)]
*  But he had this son named Rocky was his son, right? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2318.68s)]
*  And so Rocky was like, I don't know if something was wrong with him, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2321.68s)]
*  but something was pretty much wrong with him, right? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2325.68s)]
*  Like he just wasn't, you couldn't really rely on him. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2328.68s)]
*  Like if you told him something, it didn't matter because he didn't really know like what was going on a lot of times, right? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2332.68s)]
*  So you wouldn't share like a lot of information with him. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2338.68s)]
*  But Rocky had a fucking cock on him, right? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2340.68s)]
*  So one time we're all outside and Mr. Denny goes, Rocky, show him that cock, right? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2343.68s)]
*  His own son, dude. And we're all like, what the fuck, dude? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2346.68s)]

*  The latest bad news on microplastics in human health emerged last week when a study from researchers [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2518.68s)]
*  at the University of New Mexico examined 47 canine and 23 human testes, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=2523.68s)]

*  But once I landed here in the pandemic, there was no more fucking cryo. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3344.68s)]
*  Oh, there's no cryo. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3347.68s)]
*  There was nothing. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3348.68s)]
*  So my knee went to shit. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3349.68s)]
*  I got surgery. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3350.68s)]
*  I went and one day I was going for a ride and I saw a Jiu Jitsu school, a Gracie Jiu [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3351.68s)]
*  Jitsu school by my house. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3355.68s)]
*  And I went in there and I was scared shit. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3357.68s)]
*  It's December. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3361.68s)]
*  COVID's been around not even a year, you know, but people are still like not touching [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3362.68s)]
*  each other and shit. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3367.68s)]
*  And they're like, no, we're doing great here. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3368.68s)]
*  We only had to close one time. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3370.68s)]
*  But when I left there, I had a doctor's appointment like a week later, and then he [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3372.68s)]
*  told me how to have knee surgery. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3376.68s)]
*  So I didn't go back to that school. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3377.68s)]
*  I never went back to talk to him. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3379.68s)]
*  Then one day I got a call. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3381.68s)]
*  And it's the guy, the brown belt at the school. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3382.68s)]
*  His name is Sean. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3384.68s)]
*  He's like, I just want to check in with you. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3385.68s)]
*  I go, dog, after I saw you, I got knee surgery. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3387.68s)]
*  So it'll be a while. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3390.68s)]
*  This guy kept calling me and not selling. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3391.68s)]
*  He wasn't selling. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3394.68s)]
*  He was just being a nice kid going, if you want to come in and move a little bit, it'd [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3396.68s)]
*  just be me and you, man. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3401.68s)]
*  Nobody will bother you. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3402.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3403.68s)]
*  We'll work on stuff. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3404.68s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3405.68s)]
*  Fucking Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3407.68s)]
*  I went to Jiu-Jitsu the same day that the Soprano movie premiered. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3409.68s)]
*  It was September 21st of 2021. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3413.68s)]
*  And I remember I walked in there. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3416.68s)]
*  I had to cancel the first two, like I canceled two classes. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3418.68s)]
*  Finally, I go next Wednesday. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3421.68s)]
*  Now it's Wednesday. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3423.68s)]
*  And I remember going in there and we did some shit. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3424.68s)]
*  And then he goes, just roll with me for a minute. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3427.68s)]
*  And I remember leaving that and going, I feel a lot better. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3430.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3434.68s)]
*  Just human touch with somebody else. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3435.68s)]
*  I'm not gay or nothing, but just that touch of him fucking submitting me and grabbing me. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3437.68s)]
*  And I was like, I feel. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3442.68s)]
*  And then I went to the premiere that night and I was fucking COVID conscious. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3444.68s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to sit at the beacon with 2,000 fucking people to see this movie. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3448.68s)]
*  We're going to get cold. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3453.68s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't even that. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3454.68s)]
*  When I got out, the driver dropped me on the corner of the beacon. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3456.68s)]
*  And I was in a corner with 500 people and they were all like touching me and shit. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3461.68s)]
*  And I remember walking out of that circle going, if I don't get COVID now, I'll never get it. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3467.68s)]
*  Went to the movie theater. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3473.68s)]
*  Didn't even go to the premiere party. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3475.68s)]
*  Yeah, just saw the movie with my family and some friends. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3476.68s)]
*  I didn't even go to the party. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3480.68s)]
*  But going to that jujitsu class and the classes after that, like I was just going to take privates for like six months. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3481.68s)]
*  I said, fuck this. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3488.68s)]
*  I'm going into class with these guys. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3490.68s)]
*  I need these guys. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3492.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3493.68s)]
*  I need these fucking guys. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3494.68s)]
*  I need to talk to them and touch them and fucking be human around. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3495.68s)]
*  Be human. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3499.68s)]
*  Yeah, isolation is true. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3500.68s)]
*  Isolation. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3501.68s)]
*  It feels like it's what you want to do for yourself to make things easier and more comfortable. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3502.68s)]
*  And that is one of the biggest traps. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3507.68s)]
*  I notice it for myself a lot of times. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3509.68s)]
*  It's like I'll like, even the other day I had some friends that went out on the boat here on Lake Austin. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3511.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3516.68s)]
*  First I was like, I'd rather just chill, work on my comedy. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3517.68s)]
*  I'm in town. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3518.68s)]
*  I'm in Austin specifically to work on get up on stage and stuff. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3519.68s)]
*  But then I was like, I should go because I always choose the let me stay and work on something. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3524.68s)]
*  Let me stay and be by myself. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3531.68s)]
*  I always choose that. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3532.68s)]
*  And then I find myself, well, then you're always by yourself. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3534.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3537.68s)]
*  You get stuck with by yourself thoughts, by yourself bullshit. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3538.68s)]
*  You know, when you're with somebody, you get a they don't and they don't fucking run off. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3541.68s)]
*  You're like, oh, I'm all right. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3546.68s)]
*  I'm all right to be around. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3547.68s)]
*  I'm not a weird. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3548.68s)]
*  I'm not a complete weirdo, you know? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3549.68s)]
*  And so that kind of stuff is huge, man. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3551.68s)]
*  And being in those classes, it just like and you make friends, you start to realize people got your back. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3554.68s)]
*  You're not fucking alone. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3559.68s)]
*  That there's nothing is as helpful, I don't think, as going to those jujitsu classes. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3560.68s)]
*  I don't go into them as much as I wish I did because I kept getting hurt, bro. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3565.68s)]
*  I would just and I couldn't do anything. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3570.68s)]
*  I had to work. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3571.68s)]
*  I'm like, I'm fucking wheeze and I got my shit all wrapped up. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3572.68s)]
*  I got a fucking bunch of lemons, fucking duct tape to my rib cage and reading shit online, you know, eating oleander or whatever on the fucking Internet and apple seeds. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3575.68s)]
*  But but yeah, just that camaraderie, bro. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3584.68s)]
*  I remember one time we were we'd been in there rolling for the day and I just started bawling, crying, bro. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3588.68s)]
*  Like just shit from that was stuck in my body or whatever. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3594.68s)]
*  It just fucking like released, you know? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3597.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3599.68s)]
*  People don't understand. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3600.68s)]
*  Now it's what keeps me together. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3601.68s)]
*  I go every Monday and Thursday and it keeps me together. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3603.68s)]
*  I don't you have to show up with a million dollar envelope for me not to go. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3607.68s)]
*  I made that decision six months like I've been going steady, but I got hurt. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3612.68s)]
*  I hurt myself in December. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3616.68s)]
*  And after that hurt my ankle, I go, you know what? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3618.68s)]
*  I'm doing this a different way. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3620.68s)]
*  I'm going in there. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3622.68s)]
*  It's a plan. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3623.68s)]
*  Two days I lift. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3624.68s)]
*  I go to Jiu Jitsu. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3625.68s)]
*  I lift. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3626.68s)]
*  I go to Jiu Jitsu. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3627.68s)]
*  I ride the bike and I'm done for the fucking week. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3628.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's what I do. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3630.68s)]
*  Like I don't give a fuck what you got going on. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3631.68s)]
*  I'm really sorry. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3634.68s)]
*  I got to go to Jiu Jitsu because if you don't go on Monday, then you're behind the week. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3635.68s)]
*  Then you're not going to go on Tuesday. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3639.68s)]
*  Tuesday, you're going to get an audition. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3640.68s)]
*  Then Wednesday, your kid's sick. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3642.68s)]
*  You know, this is just you wake up. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3644.68s)]
*  She's sick. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3647.68s)]
*  My wife's got to do shit. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3648.68s)]
*  I got to cover. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3650.68s)]
*  And that's why I always go Monday. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3651.68s)]
*  So you always get at least that one. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3653.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3655.68s)]
*  If you want to take Thursday from me, something else will happen. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3656.68s)]
*  But that's helped me a lot because it gives you a different set of friends. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3658.68s)]
*  And it gives you a set of friends that have, you know, they're all trying to get healthy. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3666.68s)]
*  One guy's recovering from his shoulder. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3670.68s)]
*  One guy's trying to lose weight. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3672.68s)]
*  I'm just an old fuck. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3674.68s)]
*  I go in there fucking to get. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3675.68s)]
*  I go in there and burn 500 calories. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3677.68s)]

*  You know, but these are the things I'm doing now to I even enjoyed jujitsu when I was doing comedy full time because it got you away from the agents and the managers and everybody talking about the same shit all the time. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3680.68s)]

*  And then I remember another time a dude, an agent or whatever, gave me a ride to someplace introduced me to like Cuba Gooding Jr. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3708.68s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3716.68s)]

*  And I didn't know what the fuck was going on, dude. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3720.68s)]
*  I was like, if I wasn't a little brave, I would have been gay, bro. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3723.68s)]

*  You know, the place that would have the spray rig, you know. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3976.68s)]
*  Dude, remember when the spray rig would come through your neighborhood, dude? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3978.68s)]
*  We would fucking get on our bikes, bro. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3981.68s)]
*  Because in Louisiana, they sprayed that bitch fucking twice a week, dude. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3984.68s)]
*  The whole fucking everybody's stepmother looked like a mosquito in that bitch, dude. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3988.68s)]
*  But we would get on our bikes and just ride behind that gas, just pure gas coming out that bitch, dude. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3993.68s)]
*  But Rocky and then Mr. Denny, they lived downwind from one of those fucking... [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=3999.68s)]
*  That's what probably made his dick big. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4005.68s)]
*  God damn. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4007.68s)]

*  That's something that I really... That's my favorite thing is just remembering stuff from growing up. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4027.68s)]
*  Yeah, thinking about the past. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4033.68s)]

*  But growing up now feels... Yeah, it feels kind of weird. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4041.68s)]
*  I think for a lot of times I didn't want to grow up because I still wanted to just be a part... [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4044.68s)]
*  I feel like if I grow up too much, then I'll lose all the fun. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4048.68s)]
*  Does that ever make any sense to you? [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4052.68s)]
*  You know, man, it's so weird how you look at your life and you go, what the fuck? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4055.68s)]
*  I haven't had fun, like fun, fun, fun since I left New Jersey when I was 20. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4060.68s)]
*  Like that old-fashioned fun that I liked, I enjoyed, you know, just getting fucked up and laughing with your friends. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4066.68s)]
*  Sleeping on the floor and going down to shore and all that shit. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4074.68s)]
*  And then it's like I've been chasing it for the last 40 years. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4078.68s)]
*  What happened those summers when I was growing up? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4084.68s)]
*  You're just chasing it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4087.68s)]
*  You know, it's funny, I look at like I was seeing something a while ago about a club. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4088.68s)]
*  They were talking about this club and VIP and all this. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4093.68s)]
*  And I looked at it and I'm like, all this is is people chasing Studio 54. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4096.68s)]
*  That's all this is. They've been chasing Studio 54 since the 80s. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4103.68s)]
*  You know, us guys like you and I, our childhoods were fucking really special. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4108.68s)]
*  They were comical. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4113.68s)]
*  When we think of our childhood, we had no other option than to become a comic because all the tools were put in front of us. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4115.68s)]
*  The stories, the situations, other storytellers that taught us how to tell a story. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4122.68s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4128.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4129.68s)]
*  I think now, like I was always going to be a comic. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4130.68s)]
*  I just didn't know that. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4133.68s)]
*  I just didn't know that. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4134.68s)]
*  Everything all goes into one circle. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4135.68s)]
*  Everything that you've lived. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4138.68s)]
*  I remember somebody told me one time that when you do a movie, OK, like, you know, I did a bunch of movies earlier and nobody talked to me. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4139.68s)]
*  Nobody said, hey, I saw you in that movie. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4149.68s)]
*  He goes, you got to give a movie called culture. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4151.68s)]
*  You have to give a movie years. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4155.68s)]
*  And all of a sudden I saw what he meant, because one day when the podcast and everything else started lifting us, people started connecting those movies. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4157.68s)]
*  Do you follow me? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4167.68s)]
*  At first you can't connect them. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4168.68s)]
*  But after you hit a little bit and people start following you and stuff, your movies will connect. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4170.68s)]
*  You know, like it's the weirdest thing. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4176.68s)]
*  I don't even know if I'm explaining. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4178.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4179.68s)]

*  I don't know how probably Gigi Hadid or something. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4188.68s)]
*  I don't even know these fucking people. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4192.68s)]

*  Bradley Cooper. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4195.68s)]
*  All right. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4196.68s)]
*  You do a movie with Bradley Cooper and the movie comes out. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4197.68s)]
*  Bradley Cooper wins an Academy Award for it's a great movie. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4201.68s)]
*  You don't think that you're getting as much as you should have. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4204.68s)]
*  You ever see somebody do a movie and fucking they blow up. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4208.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4211.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4219.68s)]
*  OK. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4220.68s)]
*  I did 20 movies. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4221.68s)]
*  Nobody ever fucking talked to me at all. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4222.68s)]
*  They didn't talk to me till I fucking told the story about mugging a hooker and lighting her wig on fire. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4224.68s)]
*  That changed my career. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4229.68s)]
*  That was it. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4231.68s)]
*  Now people you know people start you do a Disney show. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4232.68s)]
*  Nobody wants to see it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4235.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4236.68s)]
*  You know you do a T nothing. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4237.68s)]
*  But my point is that let's say you did a movie with Bradley Cooper and you call me a year from now and go what the fuck. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4238.68s)]
*  All these motherfuckers blew up around me. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4246.68s)]
*  I got one commercial or something out of it. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4249.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4251.68s)]
*  You know. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4252.68s)]
*  But in three years as you keep growing your career keeps growing more people start going let me watch that movie because Theo's in it now. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4253.68s)]
*  I didn't know Theo was in it. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4262.68s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4263.68s)]
*  I got to watch that again because now you're somebody to them. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4264.68s)]
*  And that's how that movie gets big and connected to all the other movies. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4267.68s)]
*  It's the weirdest fucking thing because nobody would see my shit. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4271.68s)]
*  You know like I'm telling you I mean I'm going to see I did the longest yard. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4275.68s)]
*  That's the only movie people come out and shake my hand. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4279.68s)]
*  And at the end of the show they would hide from me because they thought I was going to go up there and do Adam Sandler knock knock jokes. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4281.68s)]
*  Yeah I'm up there talking about snorting coke and fucking get my dicks up. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4287.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4291.68s)]
*  The coke rock and people were like they would just leave. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4292.68s)]
*  And now you say one fucking joke about mugging a hooker and you're selling out fucking comedy clubs. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4296.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4302.68s)]
*  I don't know what it's going to be but the culture of it is what I'm talking about how you might not think nobody saw you but years from now it's like you could do 18 movies and you the movie you hate the most is the one that people come up and go. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4304.68s)]
*  Yeah we love you now you're like God damn it. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4321.68s)]
*  I did 17 other ones. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4323.68s)]
*  Yeah I did 17 other movies and that's the one you like. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4325.68s)]
*  I hated and then you tell them the story I was coked up to eight in the morning and my call time was at nine and I go no wonder you hated the fucking. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4328.68s)]
*  Yeah I think yeah yeah I guess it's like. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4339.68s)]
*  Did you think that when podcasting started it was going to be what it was did you have any real foresight on it. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4342.68s)]
*  Did you get into it because you were like oh I don't know if like acting is going to be enough for me like what was kind of your motivation to get into it. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4349.68s)]
*  I know it's kind of an old question I just don't know the answer to it. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4358.68s)]
*  2009 I moved to the valley I moved to Studio City where we live the office. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4361.68s)]

*  I saw him in Burbank and I was just chatting and he told me that right before he got Molly and whatever that fucking show was my name or whatever he was like I'm thinking of getting out of this shit because they just offered me these deals and it's no money. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=4405.68s)]

*  She was doing good man. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5411.68s)]
*  I said I got over there and I go to her house right. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5412.68s)]
*  And I'd never been there. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5416.68s)]
*  I've never been to the house that she lives in but she's only been there for maybe about a year and a half. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5417.68s)]
*  But so I go I'm knocking on the door and I'm like she's not answering. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5422.68s)]
*  I'm like oh man don't tell me like they'll finally come to see her. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5427.68s)]
*  You know and that would be my mom. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5431.68s)]
*  You know because that's how she is. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5433.68s)]
*  I finally come to visit and she goes and dies just to show me up. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5434.68s)]
*  I can see her doing that shit. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5438.68s)]
*  But I look through the window through the blinds and through the back blinds it's open and she's laying out in the back in the bikini right. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5440.68s)]
*  Because my mom will like the one time she would spend by herself she would get in her bikini and get herself a can of beer and go lay on the side. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5447.68s)]
*  How old is your mom now. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5455.68s)]
*  You don't mind me asking. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5456.68s)]
*  She's probably seventy four maybe. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5457.68s)]
*  Wow you're lucky man. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5460.68s)]
*  She's getting to see her a lot. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5461.68s)]
*  She's growing up. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5462.68s)]
*  I see her like probably twice a year. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5463.68s)]
*  I'm trying to do a little bit more. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5465.68s)]
*  This is the first time I'd ever went and like visited my mother in years. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5466.68s)]
*  You know like she never asked. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5470.68s)]
*  She never like says like I want you to come. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5472.68s)]
*  You know she doesn't she doesn't like to assert herself into things really. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5474.68s)]
*  You know she does. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5481.68s)]
*  She likes to kind of keep her distance I think in some ways. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5482.68s)]
*  But anyway she's a little bit older than me. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5486.68s)]
*  But anyway so I look through the thing and I see her in the back in that bikini in the chair and brought all the memories that when I was a kid sometimes like if she'd had enough she'd fucking go lay out in the side yard. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5489.68s)]
*  It would have fucking can of beer you know and if I look our whole apartment complex was always sinking in the mud. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5500.68s)]
*  We was always fucking fighting with the landlord. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5507.68s)]
*  It's like give us forty five bucks off. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5509.68s)]
*  We're fucking you know the dinner table is two inches lower than it was last week you know. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5511.68s)]
*  So mom's chair would be over there just slowly. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5516.68s)]
*  We thought that bitch was going to disappear. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5519.68s)]
*  Now who she lived with. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5522.68s)]
*  She lives by herself. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5523.68s)]
*  And who's down there with her. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=5524.68s)]

*  And I interrupted you. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6143.68s)]
*  I had to go to the bathroom. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6144.68s)]
*  But you were telling me that you used to call people and tell them celebrities died. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6145.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, dude. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6149.68s)]
*  And so we'd go like on Boy Scouts or whatever. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6150.68s)]
*  My buddy was in the Boy Scouts. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6152.68s)]
*  And so I remember one time we went on a camping trip with them. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6154.68s)]
*  And right when we started out, I told everybody, Jay Leno had died, right? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6157.68s)]

*  And I'd hear the dads out there talking when I'm telling the other one, you know, Jay Leno passed away. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6175.68s)]

*  And I don't know why stuff like that made me laugh so much. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6190.68s)]
*  I don't know if it was that I had control, like a hidden control or that I was affecting things without them knowing it. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6194.68s)]
*  Just there was nothing as good as that. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6200.68s)]
*  That kind of shit. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6204.68s)]

*  Wow. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6578.68s)]
*  Did moving to Jersey help you guys relationship you think? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6579.68s)]
*  One thing about me and my wife, I got to be honest with you. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6582.68s)]
*  We got into a fight in December in Nashville. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6585.68s)]
*  Yeah, good. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6588.68s)]
*  Beside that, me and my wife never really, we got into like, it was a little, a long awaited battle. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6589.68s)]
*  Her family, me, the whole thing. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6595.68s)]
*  I just went home. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6598.68s)]
*  I was in Nashville for Christmas. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6599.68s)]
*  I just went home Christmas day and she got mad at me for like two weeks. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6600.68s)]
*  We had a little problem at the house for two weeks. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6604.68s)]
*  But ever since then, it's been, and before then it was smooth, you know. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6606.68s)]
*  And we're fucking a great team. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6611.68s)]
*  And now we got this little girl and, you know, we bought this house. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6614.68s)]
*  We paid it off. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6618.68s)]
*  We did so many fucking things in three years, you know. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6619.68s)]
*  She's an accountant. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6622.68s)]
*  So I got pensions. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6623.68s)]
*  I got a pension for the pension, another pension. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6624.68s)]
*  Hopefully she's laundering money for you too. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6627.68s)]
*  Yeah, she's laundering too. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6629.68s)]
*  You know, I mean, she's a, it's great for me. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6631.68s)]
*  I never thought I would say something like this. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6635.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm on. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6637.68s)]
*  I would never in my life tell you. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6638.68s)]
*  For me, it was the best thing that happened at that time. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6641.68s)]
*  Was there a fear to do it? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6644.68s)]
*  Like, was there a fear to be like, okay, I this is... [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6646.68s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6648.68s)]
*  T.O., look at our lives. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6649.68s)]
*  We go on the road. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6651.68s)]
*  We bump into a girl. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6652.68s)]
*  You do things with them for three days. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6654.68s)]
*  Then you come back a year later and there they are. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6657.68s)]
*  And one time you come back and they obviously have a boyfriend. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6659.68s)]
*  And they bring them to the show. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6662.68s)]
*  And that's when the relationship ends. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6664.68s)]
*  And I was in Boulder before I went to LA. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6666.68s)]
*  And I had, honest to God, no lie, I probably had six girls on the rotation [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6668.68s)]
*  that would just come over to snort coke and have sex. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6673.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6676.68s)]
*  That's un-fucking-yeah. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6677.68s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing, but it's like you get used to it. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6678.68s)]
*  Right, and then it runs its course. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6681.68s)]
*  And then time changes. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6683.68s)]
*  And you come back and you're still living five years ago. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6684.68s)]
*  Five years ago and now they got chilled. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6686.68s)]
*  They got a fan. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6688.68s)]
*  So everything changes. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6689.68s)]
*  So like I was never going to get remarried. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6690.68s)]
*  I got the movie. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6693.68s)]
*  Then it took me two more years of struggling on the coke. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6696.68s)]
*  I mean, a horrid two years. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6699.68s)]
*  Heroin and then... [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6702.68s)]
*  And that was what was killing me, that I was hurting her. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6704.68s)]
*  And one day I go, you know what? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6707.68s)]
*  I got to stop this shit because listen, I'm old school. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6708.68s)]
*  I found my mother dead and I'm here. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6712.68s)]
*  I could find somebody dead, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6715.68s)]
*  but I never wanted her to find me dead because she couldn't handle it. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6717.68s)]
*  That would live with her for the rest of her life. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6721.68s)]
*  So that's what made me get clean off coke. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6724.68s)]
*  I didn't want her... [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6726.68s)]
*  There were two reasons I got off coke. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6728.68s)]
*  One, I didn't want her to find me. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6730.68s)]
*  And number two, if something happened to me, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6732.68s)]
*  I didn't want people telling Rogan he was wrong. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6735.68s)]
*  That meant a lot to me, that he had my back. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6738.68s)]
*  So now he's got my back 100% [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6741.68s)]
*  because... [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6743.68s)]
*  So I got clean and then two years later I proposed to her on the phone. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6744.68s)]
*  I just go, it's time. It's time. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6750.68s)]
*  No more shit. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6752.68s)]
*  I was going for a ride and I go, you know what? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6753.68s)]
*  I got to marry this girl. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6755.68s)]
*  And then two years later she got pregnant. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6756.68s)]
*  So it was all like... [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6758.68s)]
*  That's interesting, man. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6760.68s)]
*  Saying like, I don't want to hurt you, so I'm going to stop hurting me. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6761.68s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6764.68s)]
*  I don't want to hurt this person. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6765.68s)]
*  She could never handle waking up and finding me on the floor. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6767.68s)]
*  She doesn't have it. It's not in her DNA. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6771.68s)]
*  She's very sweet. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6773.68s)]
*  We were animals. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6775.68s)]
*  We could find anybody dead and the next day fucking go eat a pizza. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6777.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6781.68s)]
*  But she's from a different cloth, so... [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6782.68s)]
*  Hey, Rocky got that cock on him, dude. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6784.68s)]
*  What's that? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6787.68s)]
*  Rocky got that medium pepperoni on him, dude. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6788.68s)]
*  I'm telling you, dude. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6790.68s)]
*  Look, that's true, dude. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6791.68s)]
*  Sometimes I'll be sitting with somebody, I'll be like, if this person died, [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6793.68s)]
*  what would I do with him right now? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6795.68s)]
*  I literally would think that kind of shit. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6797.68s)]
*  It's fucking crazy, man. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6799.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm just in the backseat of an Uber [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6801.68s)]
*  and you're like, what the fuck would I do with this guy, you know? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6803.68s)]
*  Do you ever have tough moments, like when you think back on your own mom [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6808.68s)]
*  and that whole situation, like do you ever, like, on Mother's Day, [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6811.68s)]
*  do you do anything special? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6814.68s)]
*  Do you just say like a special prayer? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6815.68s)]
*  It's like these idiots celebrate 420 one day a year. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6819.68s)]
*  I do 420 every day. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6823.68s)]
*  There's not a day I don't think about my mom. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6825.68s)]
*  In fact, I didn't even bring flowers to a cemetery this time. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6828.68s)]
*  I went to a cemetery when I moved back to Jersey, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6832.68s)]
*  it looked like a fucking rat's nest. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6835.68s)]
*  I went, I complained, I brought some tools up there, I did some cleaning, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6837.68s)]
*  and it's like scared me now. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6842.68s)]
*  And it's like now I don't even want to be buried. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6844.68s)]
*  I don't want the people to have to come visit me and clean up my grave, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6847.68s)]
*  burn the shit out of me. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6850.68s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6852.68s)]
*  Well done. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6853.68s)]
*  The last bullet. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6854.68s)]
*  Well done. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6855.68s)]
*  Don't come visit me. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6856.68s)]
*  She lives in your heart, Dio. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6858.68s)]
*  They live in your heart and in your mind, and funny fucking stories, and you know. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6860.68s)]
*  Yeah, do you remember like a funny story that you, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6865.68s)]
*  do you have like a real fun memory that you remember with your mom? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6867.68s)]
*  Oh, I got 30,000 of those things where it's just, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6870.68s)]
*  I still remember a night where I was probably like in the eighth grade, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6874.68s)]
*  maybe in the seventh grade the second time, [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6880.68s)]
*  because I got left back in the second, seventh grade. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6883.68s)]
*  Real G's do it twice, son. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6885.68s)]
*  My mother used to fucking own a bar, and every night at three she'd come home, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6887.68s)]
*  3.15, and some nights she'd walk me up with food, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6891.68s)]
*  some nights she'd just walk me up to talk to me, to see how my day went. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6895.68s)]
*  This one particular night she woke up and she's like, get dressed. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6898.68s)]
*  There's a girl downstairs that wants to meet you. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6902.68s)]
*  That was my mother. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6905.68s)]
*  She's like, go downstairs. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6907.68s)]
*  And I went down like with warmups or something, [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6909.68s)]
*  and there were like three of my uncles, and there was all the women, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6912.68s)]
*  and fucking my stepdad, and this girl was dancing with me, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6915.68s)]
*  and I'm like, hold on, I got to go up and put on my suit. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6918.68s)]
*  At four in the morning I went upstairs and put on a suit, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6921.68s)]
*  and they're all like, go, Joey, and I'm dancing, Coquito, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6924.68s)]
*  they would call me Coquito, and I'm dancing with this girl, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6927.68s)]
*  I'm rubbing her tits and shit, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6930.68s)]
*  and finally somebody gives me like a shot of whiskey, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6932.68s)]
*  and I'm like in the seventh grade, [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6934.68s)]
*  and all of a sudden they're like, take her upstairs, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6936.68s)]
*  and I'm like, and my mom was there. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6939.68s)]
*  I didn't even make eye contact with my mom. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6941.68s)]
*  I just held her hand, and she took me upstairs to the attic, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6943.68s)]
*  not even to my bedroom. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6946.68s)]
*  We had an attic where she was going to spend the night. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6947.68s)]
*  And Theo, do you know, till this day, I cannot tell you if I fucked her, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6950.68s)]
*  ate her, kissed her, I think I just passed out from the fucking anxiety. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6954.68s)]
*  And that's the type of mom I had. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6959.68s)]
*  Like she brought a girl home for me. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6961.68s)]
*  She took me to fight somebody once. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6963.68s)]
*  She would pick fights for me. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6965.68s)]
*  She was my Dana White. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6967.68s)]
*  When I went to Catholic school and I come home, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6968.68s)]
*  she's like, you got to go home and change. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6970.68s)]
*  You got to fight at 3.30 in front of my boss. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6972.68s)]
*  Some guy cursed at me, and I told him, come back here Friday at 3.30, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6974.68s)]
*  you're going to fight my son. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6977.68s)]
*  I had to go up there and fight two fucking kids. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6978.68s)]
*  You know, it was never ended, man, with this lady. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6981.68s)]
*  But those years, this is what I'm trying to do with my daughter now, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6984.68s)]
*  because I remembered how my mom got to me. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6987.68s)]
*  And it was just real. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6991.68s)]
*  I finally had to tell my daughter a couple months ago that I smoked pot, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6993.68s)]
*  11 years old. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6997.68s)]
*  And she's looked at me like, dad, come on. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=6998.68s)]
*  I know. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7001.68s)]
*  Smoke coming out of your mouth, and you come out of the bathroom, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7003.68s)]
*  what do you think, I'm stupid? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7005.68s)]
*  She's like, everybody knows that. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7007.68s)]
*  She's like, we have smoke coming out of our house, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7008.68s)]
*  and we don't have a chimney, dad. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7010.68s)]
*  I fucking go in the garage with her sometimes. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7012.68s)]
*  She's like, dad, it smells in here. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7014.68s)]
*  She'll go, and I go, come on, you keep breaking into my house, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7016.68s)]
*  smoking dope. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7019.68s)]
*  And she's like, dad. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7020.68s)]
*  So I'm really being honest with her, little steps at a time. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7022.68s)]
*  Like, I got to break it to her. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7026.68s)]
*  She's got a sister soon, eventually. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7027.68s)]
*  Someday I got to tell her the story. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7030.68s)]
*  I don't want to tell her now because I don't want her to think, [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7032.68s)]
*  well, what if me and mommy break up? [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7036.68s)]
*  You'll never see us again. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7038.68s)]
*  So I got to be careful. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7039.68s)]
*  I thought when I put the book out, I would have to sit it down. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7040.68s)]
*  But it's been two years. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7043.68s)]
*  She didn't read it? [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7045.68s)]
*  No, she's not going to read it until I tell her to read it. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7046.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7049.68s)]
*  So things like that, you know, but I miss my mom. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7050.68s)]
*  I miss my childhood. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7054.68s)]
*  If it wasn't for my childhood, I would have never became the person [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7055.68s)]
*  I would have became. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7058.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7059.68s)]
*  Plain and simple. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7060.68s)]
*  Whether it's a criminal thing, everything I did in my childhood [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7061.68s)]
*  came to help me out later on, you know, like in some way or another. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7064.68s)]
*  So I have no fucking regrets at all, you know? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7068.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7073.68s)]

*  People were like, Joe Coco's going live, dude. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7093.68s)]
*  I would get texts from my friends back at home. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7095.68s)]
*  They're like, Coco's going live. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7097.68s)]
*  And I thought it was like a black stripper was going to do something. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7099.68s)]
*  You know, I don't know what was that. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7102.68s)]

*  Everything. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7222.68s)]
*  She's got everything for $2,200 a month. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7223.68s)]
*  Everything, weights, music, they cook in the building. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7225.68s)]
*  If I could find one of those down here, maybe get Troy Conrad in with me, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7229.68s)]
*  maybe Lee, just somebody, you know? [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7233.68s)]
*  If I'm not in town, they're in town, watching the joint. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7236.68s)]
*  You know, if they're not watching it, somebody else could come in. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7240.68s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7242.68s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking to do. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7243.68s)]
*  I can't buy a house down here. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7244.68s)]
*  I don't want to do that because I don't want to resettle. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7246.68s)]
*  I don't want to remove my daughter. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7249.68s)]
*  She's settled there now. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7251.68s)]
*  You know, for me to remove her again, fuck that. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7253.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7256.68s)]

*  And I think that's it. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7277.68s)]
*  But amongst those clubs, I did like... [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7280.68s)]
*  I mean, I probably did 12 sets at Mothership. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7283.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7291.68s)]
*  I went to get tacos after the second main room show. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7292.68s)]
*  And I wanted to do the bottom of the barrel again to get some other jokes. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7295.68s)]
*  But I was like, dog, I got to go home. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7299.68s)]
*  Yeah, I went home, dude. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7301.68s)]
*  Ended up jerking off. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7302.68s)]
*  Didn't want to, but... [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7303.68s)]

*  Oh, I hate that shit. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7312.68s)]
*  Ate breakfast, went for a nice walk, smoked a joint. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7313.68s)]
*  Went right back upstairs, watched the rest of some Clint Eastwood movie, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7316.68s)]
*  and I fucking slept from 10 to 2. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7321.68s)]
*  Oh, that's beautiful. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7323.68s)]

*  I took a long shower. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7327.68s)]
*  I shaved with one of those Puerto Rican bick razors. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7328.68s)]
*  I got skin missing. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7331.68s)]
*  I shaved my fucking ear. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7334.68s)]
*  I cut my ear. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7335.68s)]
*  You know, when you get out of the shower, you feel all these little things. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7336.68s)]
*  I could see myself as I was shaving in the shower, [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7339.68s)]
*  putting all those little cotton balls all over your face, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7341.68s)]

*  Yeah, like when he was old, old guys. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7407.68s)]
*  He was fucking old. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7410.68s)]
*  Was he still talking about fighting and stuff? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7411.68s)]
*  Was he still like... [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7412.68s)]
*  He was just, I remember his son. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7413.68s)]
*  He had a son that was a cop. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7415.68s)]
*  I think he's still in the town. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7417.68s)]
*  I think they still own the house. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7419.68s)]
*  The family still owns the house. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7420.68s)]
*  But I never saw him box. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7424.68s)]
*  He never coached me in boxing. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7425.68s)]
*  I wish he would have. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7428.68s)]
*  But you got to see him though. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7429.68s)]
*  Yeah, I got to see him. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7430.68s)]
*  And did people think he was like a hero? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7431.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7434.68s)]
*  At that time, I didn't know his full history. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7435.68s)]
*  I just knew he was a fucking boxer. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7437.68s)]
*  And there was somebody in our neighborhood [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7439.68s)]
*  that told us about him. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7441.68s)]
*  And then they said, if you ever go up there, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7443.68s)]
*  he'll give you money to shovel snow. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7446.68s)]
*  And I remember one time we went up there as kids [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7447.68s)]
*  and he was outside giving Danishers [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7449.68s)]
*  and 10 bucks if you shovel. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7452.68s)]
*  And that was it. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7454.68s)]
*  I never really saw him after that or spoke to him. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7455.68s)]
*  But you hear the legend. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7459.68s)]
*  And then it is what it is. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7460.68s)]
*  But my buddy... [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7463.68s)]
*  Well, we don't talk no more. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7465.68s)]
*  But my buddy's in charge of that park. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7467.68s)]
*  Wow. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7470.68s)]
*  He's a committee... [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7471.68s)]
*  He's like a... [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7472.68s)]
*  Groundkeeper? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7473.68s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7474.68s)]
*  He's a big time dude. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6T5E8jQwnU&t=7475.68s)]
