*  that often explores the issues that young men are facing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=103.4s)]
*  in the changing world. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=107.12s)]

*  It's one of the reasons that we're in New York City. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=111.24s)]
*  Today's guest is Mr. Scott Galloway. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  ["I'm On The Road To You"] [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=117.44s)]
*  Scott Galloway, thanks for coming, man. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=134.32s)]

*  I've never literally, when my chief of staff [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=139.46s)]
*  found out I was coming on, she wanted to come with me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=142.38s)]
*  I said, what is it about your content you like? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=144.82000000000002s)]
*  He said, no, I just think he's really hot. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=147.5s)]
*  Oh, hot? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=149.5s)]

*  And is it a man or woman? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=151.18s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=152.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=153.82s)]
*  No, Mary Jean Rebus, friends for 20 years, wonderful woman. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=154.66s)]
*  And my Prof G Markets co-host, Ed, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  who I can't get to come into an office, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=164.54000000000002s)]
*  decided he was coming to this with me. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  So you're a legend at Prof G. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=168.02s)]
*  Work from home, Ed, they always show up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=172.86s)]
*  Thanks, man, yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  I gotta get over to Prof G then, man. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=175.78s)]
*  The next time I come into this city, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=178.94s)]
*  we'll have to get over in- [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=180.34s)]
*  Yeah, we'd like that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=181.74s)]
*  And have some experience over there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=182.58s)]
*  That'd be cool, you know? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=183.62s)]
*  And I appreciate that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  And yeah, I feel lucky to have an audience, you know? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=185.74s)]
*  I think sometimes it kind of blows my mind, you know? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think I mostly just keep working. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=192.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=194.44s)]
*  You know, that's like the only feel like, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=195.28s)]
*  like the thing I know how to do best. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  Like my biggest relationship is probably with my work. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=198.48s)]
*  You know, I was thinking the other day, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=200.2s)]
*  somebody's like, you're gonna get a wife? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=201.16s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I have, you know, 40 hours a week, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=202.28s)]
*  I have this, you know, I have this, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=205.98s)]
*  work is like, feels like my wife, you know, a lot of times. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=208.48s)]
*  But I just did press positive there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=212.0s)]
*  I think that's, I think young people have to have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=213.76s)]
*  a sober conversation with themselves around trade-offs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=216.68s)]
*  And that is, I ask my kids, when I say my kids, my students, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=221.72s)]
*  where they expect to be economically [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  and in terms of influence, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=226.52s)]
*  and 70% of them expect to be in the top 1% within 10 years. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=228.08s)]
*  And what I have found is that if you want to be [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=232.24s)]
*  in the top 1% from an influence, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  from a real spiritual award from your work, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=236.28s)]
*  from a financial standpoint, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  you pretty much have to go all in for 10, probably 20 years. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=240.84s)]
*  The capitalist society is very good at figuring out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=244.28s)]
*  who's really in, you know, in it for the full 110%. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know anyone who's reached the level of success [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=251.96s)]
*  you've reached without pretty much going all in on work. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=254.62s)]
*  And it comes at a trade-off. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=258.6s)]
*  It comes at a trade-off for relationships. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=259.9s)]
*  Comes to the trade-off in terms of your own fitness, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=262.02s)]
*  your own mental wellbeing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=263.82s)]
*  But from the age of like 25 to 45, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  I really don't remember much else than working. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=267.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=269.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm not saying that's the right way. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=270.7s)]
*  Right, yeah, no. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=272.26s)]
*  But it was my way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=273.1s)]
*  And I don't regret it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=275.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny, cause I think I do, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=277.58s)]
*  I think I lament sometimes, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=279.52s)]
*  like it's so funny you say that, like this afternoon, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=281.42s)]
*  I know I have like about two hours, you know? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=283.66s)]
*  And I'm like, do I go to an AA meeting or do I stretch? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=287.3s)]
*  Right, those are like my two, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  like which one is gonna help me more for tomorrow? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=292.62s)]
*  Like, you know, like, but really like, it's like, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=296.26000000000005s)]
*  do I do some type of a fitness thing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  or do I do like a wellness thing? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=300.72s)]
*  You know, like a recovery thing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=302.94000000000005s)]
*  But yeah, it's funny, I just, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=306.26000000000005s)]
*  I thought about that a lot recently, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  cause work was like something that I think was like, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=311.34s)]
*  I knew what the return could be, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=313.7s)]
*  So it was a manageable relationship. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=315.73999999999995s)]
*  Whereas I think other relationships for me, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=318.06s)]
*  and I'm not getting into self pity, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=319.73999999999995s)]
*  those have been tougher to manage, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=321.94s)]
*  or I didn't have as much luck. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=323.17999999999995s)]
*  And not luck in meeting women, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=324.58s)]
*  but luck in actual managing relationships. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=327.32s)]
*  And so then I was like, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  well, but this relationship I can manage, you know? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  And I know what the return can be based on my investment. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=335.46s)]
*  And there's not a ton of emotional pain involved in it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=338.1s)]
*  for me or other people, you know? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  Unless you work for me, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=343.98s)]
*  sometimes I can get a little heady, you know? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=344.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and this is gonna sound crass, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=346.22s)]
*  but the opportunities, your selection set for mating [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=347.66s)]
*  will broaden as you become more successful professionally. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=351.98s)]
*  That's the cruel truth of capitalism. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  The trade off will become the relationships [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=357.3s)]
*  with your parents, your relationship with God, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=358.82000000000005s)]
*  I know you're a spiritual person, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=360.44s)]
*  the relationship you have with yourself. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=361.58000000000004s)]
*  But you'll, the world is unfair as it relates to men, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=363.72s)]
*  and that is as long as we, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=367.34s)]
*  our trajectory of success professionally [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  and economically is upward, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=370.78s)]
*  we are afforded a disproportionate number [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  of mating opportunities. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  So wait, so say that part again, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=376.14s)]
*  that the end part again, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=377.7s)]
*  if you have money, you can get laid. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=378.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=380.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=381.9s)]
*  Okay, yeah, if you have money, you can get laid. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  But then, but there's trade offs too. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=385.97999999999996s)]
*  Huge trade offs. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=387.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=388.82s)]
*  One of the things I wish I'd done, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=389.64s)]
*  I wish I had started with kids a little bit earlier. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=390.85999999999996s)]
*  I only, I have two boys. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=393.5s)]
*  One of my biggest regrets is I wish I had a third, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=395.62s)]
*  I wish I had a daughter. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=397.42s)]
*  I think a lot about like how much I'm enjoying it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=398.86s)]
*  And I was working so hard [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  that I didn't have a lot of time with them. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  And you know, they're gone. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=405.02s)]
*  You know, that eight year old that, you know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=406.06s)]
*  used to come in and sleep in my bed with me [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=408.14s)]
*  on a Sunday morning, she's gone. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=410.14s)]
*  And I see the kind of the gentleness my friends have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=411.86s)]
*  with some of their girls. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=414.14s)]
*  You know, I really messed up, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=415.9s)]
*  and I'm blessed to have two boys. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=418.86s)]
*  I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=420.1s)]
*  I look at stuff, I know rationally, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm blessed to have two boys, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=424.1s)]
*  but I look at it like I wish I'd had more kids. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=425.14s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=428.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm 44. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=428.86s)]
*  I need to have, I need to get some children. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=429.7s)]
*  I'd like to get some. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I don't know much about you, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=434.02s)]
*  but I would argue that I'm not one of these people [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=435.86s)]
*  that says you can't be happy without kids, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=439.02s)]
*  but I didn't want to have kids. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=441.38s)]
*  I wanted to be rich and awesome. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=443.38s)]
*  Those are my priorities in that order. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=445.02s)]
*  And what I found is all of that is a means to an end. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=448.38s)]
*  In a capitalist society, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=450.78s)]
*  you have to be able to be economically viable. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  Otherwise your kid's gonna feel that stress. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=454.34s)]
*  It's gonna put stress on your partnership. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  But for the first time in my life, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=458.17999999999995s)]
*  you know, there's these moments, Theo, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=460.78s)]
*  where you're watching Premier League football [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=462.41999999999996s)]
*  and your kids roll in, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=464.41999999999996s)]
*  and they jump on the couch and the docks come over, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=466.41999999999996s)]
*  and your kids just sort of naturally [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=468.78s)]
*  throw their legs on yours. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=470.38s)]
*  And it's the only time I've ever had this feel, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  and maybe you've had it other places [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=475.62s)]
*  where I'm like, this is enough. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, when I was your age, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=479.94s)]
*  coming to New York, staying at a hotel like this, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=481.17999999999995s)]
*  every afternoon I'd start thinking, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=483.58s)]
*  where am I going tonight that's cool? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=485.58s)]
*  I was at Equinox yesterday, is there a cooler gym? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm at Zero Bond, is there a more exclusive club? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=490.05999999999995s)]
*  I'm hanging out with this interesting, hot group of people. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=492.17999999999995s)]
*  Tomorrow, can I hang out with more interesting, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  more hot people? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=496.73999999999995s)]
*  This is how much money I made this month. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=498.02s)]
*  Can I make more? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  It was just like more, fuck it, I want more. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=500.38s)]
*  And the only- Where do I come from? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=502.9s)]
*  Sorry, go on. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=503.78s)]
*  And the only thing? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=504.61999999999995s)]
*  The only time I've ever been like, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=505.73999999999995s)]
*  okay, this might be enough, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  is usually in the presence of my kids. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=508.29999999999995s)]
*  That's interesting, man. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=511.58s)]
*  I have moments of, yeah, I think there was, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=512.7s)]
*  I do remember leaning against my dad [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=515.94s)]
*  when he was on the couch or something [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=518.02s)]
*  in a shirt that he would wear. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=519.38s)]
*  Or that's probably the fondest memory I have of him, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=521.4200000000001s)]
*  of just leaning in, and it didn't really matter [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=525.94s)]
*  what was going on, it was just being right there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=529.74s)]
*  Or of your dad touching you on the back of the neck, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=533.46s)]
*  that kind of stuff I think is very important for kids. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=535.6600000000001s)]
*  It's such a safe position [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=538.4200000000001s)]
*  that a dad can put their son in, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=541.1s)]
*  kind of like not choking, but just one hand. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=542.62s)]
*  And what made you create that first idea [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=545.0600000000001s)]
*  that more is the thing? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=549.62s)]
*  Because obviously you've seen that, guys, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=551.62s)]
*  we want to feel like the hunters that gathers, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=554.66s)]
*  you want to feel like the person [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=557.34s)]
*  who can put it together, the provider, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=560.78s)]
*  But what made it, you think, so crucial, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=562.94s)]
*  like in that next thing, like that hire? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=564.66s)]
*  Was it almost like an addiction kind of achievement? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=566.78s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=570.1s)]
*  I know the exact moment I got my act together [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=571.7s)]
*  and I got really motivated. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=574.86s)]
*  Growing up, I had, I described my childhood [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=576.34s)]
*  as remarkably unremarkable. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=578.62s)]
*  It wasn't especially good or especially bad. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=579.9s)]
*  I was raised by a single immigrant mother [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=582.46s)]
*  who lived and died a secretary. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=583.98s)]
*  Yeah, but it wasn't a bad life. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=586.5s)]
*  But the moment that changed everything for me [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=589.38s)]
*  was my mom got very sick when I was in graduate school [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=591.5s)]
*  and she called me and said, you need to come home. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=594.9s)]
*  My mom's not a dramatic person. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=597.22s)]
*  And so I flew home and went into a situation [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=600.18s)]
*  that was, she had been released early. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=602.5s)]
*  We were kind of underinsured. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=604.5s)]
*  She just had her second mastectomy. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=606.26s)]
*  She had been through chemo in the hospital. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=607.9399999999999s)]
*  Basically booted her out kind of prematurely. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=610.26s)]
*  And I walked into a situation [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=612.4599999999999s)]
*  I just did not know how to handle. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=613.74s)]
*  And I started calling nurses and nurses were 35 bucks an hour [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=615.66s)]
*  and we just didn't have that kind of money. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=619.18s)]
*  And that feeling, you'll feel this [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=621.3399999999999s)]
*  and maybe you feel it now with your staff [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=623.5s)]
*  and your parents. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=626.7s)]
*  But as a man, I think you have a very healthy instinct [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=629.7s)]
*  around protection. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=632.5s)]
*  And this woman who'd been so good to me, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=633.82s)]
*  I couldn't take care of her. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=636.0200000000001s)]
*  And to be honest, Theo was humiliating. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=637.46s)]
*  And that was when I said, okay, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=640.34s)]
*  I gotta get my act together. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=644.26s)]
*  I gotta be able to take care of my mom. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=645.6600000000001s)]
*  So that was really sort of my driving. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=647.62s)]
*  I thought, okay, I didn't wanna save the whales. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=650.6600000000001s)]
*  I didn't wanna be a good person. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=652.9000000000001s)]
*  I didn't want a close relation with God. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=653.9000000000001s)]
*  I wanted economic security for me and my mom. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=656.06s)]
*  And that was, and also the other flip side of it [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=659.3s)]
*  isn't nearly as noble. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=662.4599999999999s)]
*  I also noticed that my male friends [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=664.2199999999999s)]
*  whose parents had homes in Aspen and were driving BMWs [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=665.9s)]
*  were hanging out with higher character, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=669.7399999999999s)]
*  better looking women than I was. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=671.8199999999999s)]
*  And that women weren't drawn to men with resources, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=674.3s)]
*  not only because they could offer them a better life, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=677.8599999999999s)]
*  but because it reflected discipline and character [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=680.0999999999999s)]
*  and that they might be better dads. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=682.02s)]
*  But the bottom line is the thing that motivated me [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=685.58s)]
*  was women wanting to take care of my mom [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=690.5s)]
*  and wanting to be more attractive to a potential mate. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=693.9000000000001s)]
*  That's when I got my act together. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=696.26s)]
*  Yeah, and I guess that's really probably the truth [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=697.6600000000001s)]
*  for a lot of, and some of that's nature, right? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=699.94s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=702.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because women want to be felt safe. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=704.22s)]
*  Oh dude, I remember this dude, Mr. Willie, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=707.7800000000001s)]
*  put a fence up on his fucking house in our neighborhood. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=709.5400000000001s)]
*  And people were like, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=712.5s)]
*  what's this fucking hero over here? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=713.38s)]
*  Because nobody else had it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=716.14s)]
*  That's what takes a fence? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=717.5s)]
*  It was one of those double door fences. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  And we were like, this guy, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=721.4200000000001s)]
*  they think they live in a damn estate. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=722.82s)]
*  But yeah, I think there is something about that, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=727.58s)]
*  about being able to provide. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=729.4200000000001s)]
*  So it makes you feel, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=731.38s)]
*  especially if you don't know anything else, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=732.7s)]
*  I think it's the first and most, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=735.1s)]
*  I don't wanna say the easiest thing to do, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=738.1800000000001s)]
*  but it's something you can immediately start to do. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=739.62s)]
*  I think everybody needs a code, right? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=742.2199999999999s)]
*  It sounds like you get a few codes from different places, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=743.9399999999999s)]
*  whether it's your spirituality or your church. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=746.8199999999999s)]
*  I think AA has a nice code. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=749.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably my biggest one. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=750.66s)]
*  And it's a powerful one, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=752.18s)]
*  And it's a construct that works for millions of people. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=753.4599999999999s)]
*  And the thing I like about AA is, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=755.4599999999999s)]
*  it's both an opportunity to improve yourself, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=758.9s)]
*  but immediately move to how you help others. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=761.8199999999999s)]
*  Being in the service of something bigger than yourself. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=764.18s)]
*  It feels to me like a really strong code. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=766.6199999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out how, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=769.42s)]
*  if masculinity can be a code for young men. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=771.3s)]
*  I feel like a lot of young men now, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=773.86s)]
*  they're not attaching to church, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=775.26s)]
*  they're not attaching to school, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=776.42s)]
*  more single parent households than any country but Sweden. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=777.9s)]
*  They're not joining the service. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=781.42s)]
*  They're not in a relationship. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=783.9s)]
*  Only one in three men under the age of 30 [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=785.3399999999999s)]
*  is in a relationship, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=787.06s)]
*  whereas two in three women under the age of 30 [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=787.9399999999999s)]
*  is in a relationship. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=790.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=791.26s)]
*  Because women are dating older [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=792.18s)]
*  because they want more economically [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=793.4599999999999s)]
*  and emotionally viable men. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=794.66s)]
*  So if a guy has, is not going to church, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=796.54s)]
*  he's not playing sports, not in college, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=799.6999999999999s)]
*  not in a relationship, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=801.5799999999999s)]
*  and he doesn't have a male role model, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=802.5s)]
*  where does he get his code? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=804.3399999999999s)]
*  And I actually think that while masculinity [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=806.0999999999999s)]
*  has been conflated incorrectly in my view [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=808.02s)]
*  with toxicity or something bad, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=810.14s)]
*  how can we better define a modern form of masculinity [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=812.2199999999999s)]
*  such that it can serve as a code for young men? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=815.4599999999999s)]
*  A guiding light the same way kind of AA has for you. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=818.0999999999999s)]
*  And I think very loosely, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=821.26s)]
*  and I'm writing a book on this [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=822.54s)]
*  and I still haven't figured it out, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=823.4599999999999s)]
*  and I'm curious if you have any thoughts. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=824.5s)]
*  I think the kind of the three legs of the stool [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=827.34s)]
*  are provider. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=829.14s)]
*  We live in a capitalist society. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=831.14s)]
*  I'm not talking about the way the world should be, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=832.74s)]
*  the way it is. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=834.1s)]
*  Men are disproportionately evaluated [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=835.38s)]
*  based on their economic viability. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=836.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=838.5400000000001s)]
*  If your son lives in a, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=839.38s)]
*  or your daughter lives in a household [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=841.0600000000001s)]
*  that's economically strained, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=842.5s)]
*  he or she is going to have a higher resting [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  to stall like blood pressure. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=845.7s)]
*  Stress from economic stress invades everything [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=847.3000000000001s)]
*  in a capitalist society. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=849.98s)]
*  You're expected to be a provider. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=851.14s)]
*  And by the way, sometimes that means [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=852.3000000000001s)]
*  getting out of the way [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=854.4200000000001s)]
*  of your partner who happens to be better [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=855.82s)]
*  at this money thing than you. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=857.3000000000001s)]
*  More women are graduating from college, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=858.34s)]
*  two out of three jobs now need college degrees. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=859.82s)]
*  But you should start from a position [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=862.86s)]
*  of I need to be economically viable. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=864.34s)]
*  I need to learn to trade, to skill, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  get certified, show up, work hard, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=867.58s)]
*  and try and have some discipline around saving, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=870.7s)]
*  develop a savings muscle. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=873.46s)]
*  Don't be that idiot that orders bottle service. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=874.7s)]
*  Try to show you have your act together economically. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=877.98s)]
*  Two, protector. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=880.82s)]
*  I think a really nice default setting for a man [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=882.4200000000001s)]
*  should be an immediate movement to protection. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=884.5s)]
*  Like real men break up fights at bars, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=887.18s)]
*  they don't start them. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=889.82s)]
*  Real men protect their country, they don't shit post it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=890.66s)]
*  Real men don't complain, they're there to absorb. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=893.94s)]
*  They add surplus value. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=896.5s)]
*  They create more revenue for the government [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=897.9s)]
*  than they consume. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=899.62s)]
*  They help people more than maybe they require help. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=901.02s)]
*  And sometimes that can go off the rails [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=904.22s)]
*  because some men feel like it's not masculine [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=906.1s)]
*  to express vulnerability. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=908.78s)]
*  So there's a downside to that. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=910.54s)]
*  Maybe you don't understand the LGBT community, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=912.34s)]
*  maybe you don't believe in all this, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=914.34s)]
*  what's going on with the focus on trans rights, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=916.7800000000001s)]
*  but your first instinct should be, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=919.7800000000001s)]
*  if you see a community that's being demonized, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=921.98s)]
*  whether it's migrants, the LGBT community, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=924.34s)]
*  your first instinct as a man, I think, should be to protection. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=927.26s)]
*  You hear someone talking shit about someone behind their back, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=930.14s)]
*  your first instinct should be to protection. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=932.98s)]
*  So I like that notion of protection. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=935.5400000000001s)]
*  And the final one that's more controversial is procreator. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=937.1s)]
*  I think the desire, where I am now, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=941.02s)]
*  most rewarding thing in my life [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=946.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about is my boys. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=947.4200000000001s)]
*  If we reverse engineer it, it's them, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=948.82s)]
*  it's my partner having birth, it's us living together, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=951.86s)]
*  it's us getting a dog, it's us spending a lot of time together, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=955.3000000000001s)]
*  it's us having a relationship. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=958.46s)]
*  But if I reverse engineer it to the source code [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=960.02s)]
*  or the most rewarding thing in my life, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=962.26s)]
*  it's me seeing this very attractive woman [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=964.0600000000001s)]
*  at the hotel pool at the Raleigh Hotel, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=965.78s)]
*  and I didn't think, oh, she's going to be great [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=968.1s)]
*  at buying land and developing it, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=969.86s)]
*  and she's going to be economically viable [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=972.58s)]
*  and she's going to be a great mom, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=974.1s)]
*  it started with me really being physically attracted to her. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=975.5400000000001s)]
*  And I think men need to look at themselves and say, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=979.1800000000001s)]
*  how do I put myself in a position [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=981.5s)]
*  where I can be not only attractive to women [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=984.58s)]
*  but get the skills where I can express physical desire [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=986.1800000000001s)]
*  while making them feel safe? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=989.82s)]
*  And it's a very basic question. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=991.94s)]
*  Would you want to have sex with you? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=993.7800000000001s)]
*  Would you want to be romantic with you? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  Are you in good shape? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=997.3000000000001s)]
*  Are you a good person? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=998.62s)]
*  Are you kind? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=999.5s)]
*  Or do you have your act together professionally? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1000.94s)]
*  Do you listen? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1003.22s)]
*  Do you give notice to their life? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1004.06s)]
*  But protector, provider, and procreator, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1006.26s)]
*  I would like to figure out a way [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1008.9s)]
*  to develop a more aspirational model for masculinity [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1010.54s)]
*  that serves as a role model or a code for young men. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1014.22s)]
*  The book that you're working on now [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1018.86s)]
*  is something that you're saying [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1019.82s)]
*  that that kind of addresses some of that space, you know? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1020.98s)]
*  Like figure, like kind of almost giving a, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1023.62s)]
*  like kind of charting a course, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1026.1s)]
*  but adding some coordinates to a course for young men? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1027.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1030.3s)]
*  Young men, there's no group in the world [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1031.26s)]
*  that's ascended faster than women. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1033.62s)]
*  More women are seeking tertiary education globally [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1035.8999999999999s)]
*  than men now. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1038.46s)]
*  Twice as many women have been elected [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1039.58s)]
*  to some sort of form of parliament in the last 30 years. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1041.06s)]
*  More single women own homes in the US than single men. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1044.18s)]
*  In urban centers, women are making more money [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1047.6599999999999s)]
*  under the age of 30 than men. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1050.5s)]
*  And by the way, we should do nothing [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1051.86s)]
*  to get in the way with that. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1053.3s)]
*  Yeah, no, dude. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1054.46s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1055.3s)]
*  They're the league of their own fan, you know? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1056.14s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1057.6200000000001s)]
*  But the second order effect we were planning on, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1058.5800000000002s)]
*  and we don't like to talk about this, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1062.18s)]
*  is that 50% of women say [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1064.22s)]
*  they want data guys shorter than them. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1065.74s)]
*  I bet it's 80%, they're just embarrassed to admit it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1066.98s)]
*  And metaphorically, every year, women are getting taller [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1069.98s)]
*  and men are getting shorter. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1073.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1074.46s)]
*  So. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1075.3000000000002s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1076.14s)]
*  Well, metaphorically, if you look at how many, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1076.98s)]
*  oh, 100% women are killing it right now, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1080.42s)]
*  50% more women will get college degrees this year. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1083.02s)]
*  Right, so. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1086.66s)]
*  More than men? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1087.5s)]
*  They'll be, it's 60-40. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1088.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1089.7s)]
*  It used to be 40-60. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1090.54s)]
*  Got it, so that's it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1091.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's about the same. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1092.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's about 50% more in a couple years. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1093.06s)]
*  One in three men walking down the street [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1094.34s)]
*  under the age of 30 hasn't had sex in the last year. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1095.9s)]
*  So in mating, if we're gonna have an honest conversation [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1098.38s)]
*  about mating, we have to have an honest conversation. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1100.82s)]
*  Women mate socioeconomically horizontally and up. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1103.94s)]
*  Men horizontally and down. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1106.9s)]
*  Three out of four women say economic viability [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1108.82s)]
*  is key to a mate. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1110.94s)]
*  Only one in three men state that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1111.86s)]
*  So when the pool of horizontal and up of men is shrinking, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1114.2199999999998s)]
*  there's less household formation, there's less relationships. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1119.02s)]
*  And the weird thing about a lack of a relationship [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1122.3s)]
*  is that when a woman doesn't have a romantic relationship, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1124.4599999999998s)]
*  she finds more productive uses for that additional energy. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1126.6999999999998s)]
*  She'll channel it into work, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1129.9399999999998s)]
*  she'll channel it into her friends, into her family. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1131.1799999999998s)]
*  Guys come off the rails when they don't have [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1134.1399999999999s)]
*  the guideposts of a romantic relationship. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1136.9799999999998s)]
*  I know I did. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1139.26s)]
*  I was getting high every night. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1141.22s)]
*  I love marijuana. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1142.6599999999999s)]
*  And I remember my girlfriend saying to me basically, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1143.86s)]
*  what it came right down to is she said, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1147.1s)]
*  if you don't stop getting high every night, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1148.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna stop having sex with you. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1150.34s)]
*  And so I decided to stop getting high every night [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1152.4199999999998s)]
*  because I really enjoyed what we were doing [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1155.3799999999999s)]
*  and I enjoyed the relationship. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1157.54s)]
*  I think guys need that guidepost of a relationship. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1159.5s)]
*  And oftentimes when men don't have the guideposts [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1162.8999999999999s)]
*  of a relationship, they become insecure. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1166.02s)]
*  They start becoming more prone to conspiracy theory. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1171.66s)]
*  They start blaming women. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1173.86s)]
*  They start blaming other people. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1175.34s)]
*  I mean, some of the skills to maintain [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1177.26s)]
*  a healthy relationship are some of the same skills [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1180.6200000000001s)]
*  required to be professionally successful. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1182.54s)]
*  And so single men are basically [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1185.1s)]
*  the most dangerous thing in the world. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1189.02s)]
*  A young, single, broke man. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1190.66s)]
*  And I don't wanna pathologize every guy [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1192.18s)]
*  that doesn't have a girlfriend. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1194.34s)]
*  If you look at the most violent, unstable societies [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1196.14s)]
*  in the world, they have a preponderance of one thing [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1198.34s)]
*  and that is young men without a lot of economic [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1200.14s)]
*  or romantic opportunities. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1202.0600000000002s)]
*  And you're saying we're creating more of those now? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1203.66s)]
*  Oh, 100%. Wow. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1205.74s)]
*  Twice as many women under the age of 30 [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1207.94s)]
*  are in a relationship versus men under the age of 30. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1209.66s)]
*  Three million millennial men have given up on dating. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1211.66s)]
*  They're not even trying. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1214.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in groups with a lot of them. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1215.14s)]
*  Here's one thing I would, so how does it start? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1217.22s)]
*  So let's say like, how does it kind of start to, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1219.66s)]
*  if a lot of people are growing up, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1221.3000000000002s)]
*  because it feels like a lot of times [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1223.74s)]
*  that a lot of our media or our society [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1225.18s)]
*  has wanted to break up the nuclear family, right? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1228.38s)]
*  And I don't know if that's sometimes like, I buy into that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1233.42s)]
*  I grew up outside of a regular family like you did. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1237.74s)]
*  And so, you definitely see the side effects of that. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1239.66s)]
*  Like I have siblings that went kind of errant ways [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1243.46s)]
*  and found hope and purpose and friendship [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1247.3000000000002s)]
*  and people that were making poor choices. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1252.1000000000001s)]
*  I got kind of lucky and found some friends [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1254.1000000000001s)]
*  that were doing the opposite kind of, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1256.46s)]
*  but not having that role model, I think, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1258.98s)]
*  in the home probably is probably a big start. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1260.74s)]
*  So if that's something big that's going on, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1264.82s)]
*  how do we, like, where do we even start with that? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1266.38s)]
*  Like, how do you start to fix the family first, I guess? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1271.42s)]
*  I mean, what do you fix first? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1275.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, like role models? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1277.74s)]
*  You've exactly zeroed in on the ground zero of it. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1279.66s)]
*  If you look at, so first off, let's look at the problem. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1283.82s)]
*  If you go into a morgue and you have five young people [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1287.4s)]
*  who've died by suicide, four of them are men. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1289.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1292.1200000000001s)]
*  But women aren't, I mean, women aren't, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  women don't wanna, they would rather have somebody [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1296.92s)]
*  kill them, I think, or you know what I'm saying? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1300.44s)]
*  That's crazy to say, but it's like. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  I agree with you, that was crazy to say. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1303.92s)]
*  But they love Dayline, you know what I'm saying? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  Like women, there's something. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1306.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, they like crime dramas. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1307.92s)]
*  There's a difference between like crime drama. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1309.04s)]
*  Yeah, but they want a guy to unexpectedly [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1311.0800000000002s)]
*  come over type of shit. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1312.56s)]
*  There's some weird shit. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1313.8s)]
*  So for example, women are just as prone [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1315.0s)]
*  to try to commit suicide. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1317.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, men are more comfortable with gunplay [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1318.44s)]
*  and are more successful at it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1320.72s)]
*  But if you look at where a guy comes, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1322.48s)]
*  a boy comes off the tracks, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1325.04s)]
*  it's when he loses a male role model. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  More single parent homes than any country [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1330.04s)]
*  except for Sweden. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1333.14s)]
*  And the interesting thing is that a girl [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1334.0800000000002s)]
*  in a single parent home, when we say single parent, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1336.18s)]
*  we mean 92% of the time headed by mom. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1338.48s)]
*  Right, because usually children stay with the mom. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1341.8s)]
*  The family court is very biased towards women [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1344.04s)]
*  for a lot of good reasons, some less good reasons. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1346.0s)]
*  So a girl in a single parent home, just living with mom, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1349.32s)]
*  has the same college attendance, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1352.96s)]
*  the same levels of self-harm and depression, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1354.56s)]
*  the same likelihood of depression. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1356.36s)]
*  She's fine. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1359.62s)]
*  Once a boy loses a male role model, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1361.52s)]
*  he becomes dramatically more likely to be incarcerated, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1363.26s)]
*  less likely to go to college, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1365.76s)]
*  more likely to engage in self-harm. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1367.08s)]
*  What most of the studies show is that [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1369.04s)]
*  while boys are physically stronger, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1370.6s)]
*  they're mentally and emotionally much weaker than girls. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1372.8s)]
*  They mature later. I can see that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1375.72s)]
*  They mature later, they're more prone to violence, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1377.2s)]
*  they're more prone to self-harm. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1380.8s)]
*  They're literally 18 months behind [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1382.68s)]
*  their prefrontal cortex, they're biologically less mature. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1384.12s)]
*  And without the male role model, the deep voice, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1388.44s)]
*  the admiration, the virtuous role model of a man, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1391.6399999999999s)]
*  they come off the tracks. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1395.76s)]
*  And when you look at a lot of our communities [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1396.9199999999998s)]
*  with how many single parent homes they have, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1399.2s)]
*  when you look at a lot of kids [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1401.36s)]
*  aren't in afterschool programs, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1402.52s)]
*  kids are obese, not playing sports as much, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1403.8799999999999s)]
*  so they don't have as much interaction with a coach. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1405.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe they don't know a pastor [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1408.36s)]
*  because they're not going to church or temple. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1409.6399999999999s)]
*  There are millions of young boys who grow up [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1411.76s)]
*  and the first male role model they have is a prison guard. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1415.04s)]
*  And so the solution, if you were to try and win with programs, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  it's all right, I think of another, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  I think of, I go back to masculinity. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1426.4799999999998s)]
*  The first circle of masculinity is you take care of yourself. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1429.0s)]
*  You're in good shape, you have good self-care, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1431.48s)]
*  you are economically viable, right? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1434.68s)]
*  You take care of yourself. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1436.88s)]
*  Next ring out, you can start taking care of your family. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1437.88s)]
*  Help out your parents, help out your siblings. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1440.48s)]
*  You can start taking care of people at work. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1442.96s)]
*  You overpay them. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  You're concerned about them, you're empathetic with them. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1447.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1448.88s)]
*  Yeah, don't listen. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1449.72s)]
*  Because there are two of them in here. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1450.56s)]
*  You start taking care of your community. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1452.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1454.16s)]
*  And then. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1455.0s)]
*  Yeah, things that make you feel good, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1455.8400000000001s)]
*  things that make you feel purpose. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1457.2s)]
*  Surplus value. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1459.28s)]
*  And then I think also we need to create [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1460.48s)]
*  a kind of a gestalt or a default or a zeitgeist [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1462.64s)]
*  in our society where one of the ultimate expressions [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1464.88s)]
*  of masculinity is you take an interest [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1467.4s)]
*  in the well-being of a boy that's not yours. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1471.04s)]
*  And unfortunately, because of some very unfortunate instances [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1473.92s)]
*  in the Catholic Church or well-publicized stories about. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1476.44s)]
*  Chuck E. Cheese's. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1480.04s)]
*  Or Michael Jackson. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1481.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1483.0s)]
*  I was on Bill Maher and I said, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1484.0s)]
*  more men like you, Bill, need to get involved [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1485.52s)]
*  in a young man's life. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1487.4s)]
*  He's a single guy. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1488.24s)]
*  He's a good role model. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1489.08s)]
*  And he's like, I can't get involved [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1490.52s)]
*  in a 15 year old boy's life. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1491.64s)]
*  Do you know what they'd say about me? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1492.88s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1494.4s)]
*  Because there's a lot of men out there [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1495.4s)]
*  with a lot of love to give [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1496.72s)]
*  who feel a lot of fraternal and paternal love. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1498.48s)]
*  And if you just did a quick survey [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1501.44s)]
*  of the people in your work and your neighbors, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1504.64s)]
*  you're gonna find single mothers or a lot of your friends [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1506.32s)]
*  whose sons are struggling. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  And you don't have to be a baller. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1512.2s)]
*  You just need to be a virtuous guy [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1513.68s)]
*  trying to live your life. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1515.04s)]
*  And my mom was really good at that. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  I had a guy down the hallway come over with his girlfriend [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1518.72s)]
*  and say, we're going horseback riding. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1521.3999999999999s)]
*  And he took me and he would start taking me. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1523.44s)]
*  My mom, a couple of my mom's boyfriends [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1525.76s)]
*  stay involved in my life after they were broken up. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1527.3999999999999s)]
*  I had a stockbroker, Theo, when I was 13, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1529.52s)]
*  I walked into Dean Witter Reynolds with $200 [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1533.1599999999999s)]
*  my mom's boyfriend had given me. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1535.72s)]
*  And I bought 12 shares of Columbia Pictures [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1537.76s)]
*  for 16 bucks a share. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1540.32s)]
*  And every day for two years, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1541.72s)]
*  I'd go to Emerson Junior High Pay booth, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1543.24s)]
*  put in two dimes and call him. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't a very popular kid. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1546.9199999999998s)]
*  Two or three times a week after school, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1548.1599999999999s)]
*  I'd go to the stock brokerage. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1549.4399999999998s)]
*  If you're buying stocks at lunch, yeah, you're not popular. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1550.56s)]
*  Hey, you're forward thinking. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1553.84s)]
*  Sure, sure, it's paid off now. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1554.9199999999998s)]
*  I get that part. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1557.4399999999998s)]
*  It made me cool later in life. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1558.28s)]
*  Yeah, at a certain point, yeah, for sure. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1560.52s)]
*  This guy, Sy Sarrow, this 30 year old guy [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1562.4399999999998s)]
*  we're gonna Dean Witter and 46 years later, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1565.6399999999999s)]
*  I got a text from Sy yesterday. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1569.32s)]
*  We're still close. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1571.12s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1571.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we were out of each other's lives [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1572.8s)]
*  for 30 years and then we reconnected. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1575.68s)]
*  I actually asked my class to try and track them down [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1576.52s)]
*  and they did. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1578.32s)]
*  But if you're, I love the statement. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1579.6s)]
*  I think the true expression of manhood [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1582.8s)]
*  or being a good person is planting trees, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1584.84s)]
*  the shade of which you'll never sit under. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1587.36s)]
*  But I think more specifically for men, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1588.96s)]
*  well, I'll ask you straight up. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1591.2s)]
*  Are you mentoring any young men or boys? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1593.36s)]
*  Let me think about that. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1595.72s)]
*  Maybe one of my nephews, but I mean, he has his father, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1599.36s)]
*  but I think I keep a constant relationship with him [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1603.36s)]
*  because I want to be a part of his life. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1605.52s)]
*  But in a more local environment in my community, no. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1607.72s)]
*  Do you realize in New York, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1611.24s)]
*  there's big sisters and big brothers. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1612.1599999999999s)]
*  There are three times as many applicants for big sisters [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1613.6s)]
*  than there are for big brothers. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1616.08s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1617.56s)]
*  Because young men, mothers don't get there [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1618.3999999999999s)]
*  or the kids, the male, the boys don't apply? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1620.6s)]
*  I think men have been told that if you take an interest [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1623.96s)]
*  in the life of a boy, that there's something wrong [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1626.32s)]
*  and people need to be suspect of it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1628.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people would definitely question it. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1632.08s)]
*  I remember this started maybe about 10 years ago. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1633.44s)]
*  If I saw somebody's kid or something [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1635.0s)]
*  and I wanted to give them a compliment, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1637.1200000000001s)]
*  you feel like you couldn't. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1639.3200000000002s)]
*  You gotta be careful. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1640.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and then suddenly, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1641.4s)]
*  You gotta be careful. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1643.44s)]
*  everything, there's a legal issue or you can't. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1644.28s)]
*  Or people are suspicious. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1647.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a famous case of this kid, Greg Kelly. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1648.3600000000001s)]
*  Can you bring that up? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1650.72s)]
*  His mother was watching children. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1652.64s)]
*  She ran a home in their afterschool care in their home. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1654.3600000000001s)]
*  And one of the kids accused him of something [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1658.44s)]
*  and it seemed very flippant, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1661.44s)]
*  but he ended up going to jail for three years [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1662.9199999999998s)]
*  and it seemed like a witch hunt. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1665.08s)]
*  Yeah, there was that childcare place in California [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1667.1599999999999s)]
*  where it ended up it was all made up. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1669.32s)]
*  But Theo, what you were talking about with your nephew, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1672.04s)]
*  you can still play a huge role because I can attest to this. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1675.32s)]
*  There's research showing your nephew right now, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1678.04s)]
*  especially once he hits 15 or 16, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1680.56s)]
*  he's more inclined to listen to you than his dad. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1682.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1685.1599999999999s)]
*  So I noticed this. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1686.08s)]
*  Yeah, did you notice things? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1687.56s)]
*  Yeah, who were some people that, yeah, when you, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  because sometimes I do, I think about a voice [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1690.24s)]
*  that could be just like, dude, sometimes it was like, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1691.96s)]
*  I remember one of my mom's boyfriends bought me [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1695.48s)]
*  and my brother tickets to go see a Saints game, right? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1698.04s)]
*  And we were so excited. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1700.56s)]
*  It was like a big adventure for us. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1701.72s)]
*  So it is funny how little things [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1704.92s)]
*  that somebody shares with you or moments that they have. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1706.76s)]
*  I remember there was a teacher that would sit outside [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1710.68s)]
*  with me and talk to me sometimes after class. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1712.64s)]
*  That was huge to me. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1715.32s)]
*  So yeah, it's amazing the effect that you can have, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1716.92s)]
*  I guess, that you don't realize. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1721.52s)]
*  Who were some of those people for you? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1723.76s)]
*  I was really lucky. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1725.52s)]
*  I had, I played sports, so I had coaches, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1726.76s)]
*  a couple of my mom's boyfriends, like I said, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1729.64s)]
*  after they broke up, stayed involved in my life. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1731.48s)]
*  I had Cy, the stockbroker. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1733.5600000000002s)]
*  And also I'm a big fan of the Greek system at colleges. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1736.3200000000002s)]
*  I joined a fraternity. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1739.44s)]
*  And while people talk about, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1741.16s)]
*  everyone's gotta find their tribe. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1744.0s)]
*  You gotta find your brothers or your sisters. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1745.72s)]
*  You gotta shrink the world down to a small group of people. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1747.5600000000002s)]
*  And for me, I don't think I would have graduated [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1750.48s)]
*  from UCLA had I not joined a fraternity. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1752.76s)]
*  I merely got something called a big brother. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1754.96s)]
*  I had roommates. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1757.5200000000002s)]
*  We all kept tabs on each other. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1758.6000000000001s)]
*  We all gave each other a tremendous amount of shit, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1759.92s)]
*  but it was sort of like a guiding guidepost. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1761.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1764.0s)]
*  Oh dude, there's so much fun. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1765.44s)]
*  There's nothing better than when you think about the times [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1767.2s)]
*  you were on a team of some sort, right? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1770.24s)]
*  100%. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1772.0800000000002s)]
*  Just like the feeling. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1772.92s)]
*  Did you play sports growing up? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1773.76s)]
*  Until I was like 11 years old, I didn't do much sports. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1775.72s)]
*  I played a little bit of baseball, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1779.6s)]
*  but the field was uneven in our town. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1780.96s)]
*  And so the fucking, every ball went to the same guy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1784.28s)]
*  The field was uneven. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1787.44s)]
*  Yeah, we had a bad field over there. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1788.68s)]
*  And so all this dude, and I was- [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1791.2s)]
*  You couldn't get the guy with the radical, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1793.44s)]
*  the amazing fence to give you the new field. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1795.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bad idea, right? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1798.28s)]
*  But it doesn't have to be sports. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1801.28s)]
*  It can be band, it can be chess club, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1802.36s)]
*  it can be church, but everyone's gotta find your tribe. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1804.44s)]
*  Right, so now we're looking at some solutions [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1807.0800000000002s)]
*  to some of the things you're talking about for young people [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1808.96s)]
*  and even for mothers that have single, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1810.8400000000001s)]
*  because a lot of times with moms, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1812.96s)]
*  it's hard to find that space. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1813.96s)]
*  Like how do I put my kid in a place that's gonna be safe [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1815.16s)]
*  or what's the type of thing to get them involved in? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1818.2800000000002s)]
*  And yeah, I think that was one thing [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1820.8000000000002s)]
*  that was tough for my mom. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1821.88s)]
*  She just didn't have as much time. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1822.72s)]
*  I was fortunate I had a basketball coach [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1824.16s)]
*  that would give me rides home from practice. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1825.64s)]
*  And so that changed a lot of things [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1827.24s)]
*  because then as long as I could get to practice [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1828.64s)]
*  and I could get home. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1830.68s)]
*  So that was like an amazing role model [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1832.6000000000001s)]
*  that I had this guy coach Steve that was really awesome. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1835.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think, and yeah, you're right. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1838.92s)]
*  Like how can I do that in my own community? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1840.68s)]
*  Like what are ways that I could start to do that? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1842.36s)]
*  But yeah, so creating a group for your kid, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1844.76s)]
*  finding a group for your kid to be in. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1846.92s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1849.16s)]
*  and there's a lot of more systemic things we could do. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1850.0s)]
*  So for example, I'm a big fan of vocational programming. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1851.8s)]
*  In America, we have this kind of zeitgeist [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1855.84s)]
*  that if your kid doesn't go to Dartmouth [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1858.16s)]
*  and end up at Google, then not only has the kid failed, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1860.1200000000001s)]
*  but you failed as parents. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1862.28s)]
*  Our kids are not gonna end up with a college degree. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1863.44s)]
*  3% of LinkedIn profiles in the USA apprentice, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1866.44s)]
*  it's 11% in the UK and Germany. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1869.6000000000001s)]
*  We need more of an apprentice culture [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1871.24s)]
*  and we need to stop shaming kind of trades jobs. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1872.72s)]
*  I think we should start boys, we should redshirt them. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1876.44s)]
*  We should start them a year later in kindergarten [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1879.88s)]
*  because they're literally biologically less mature [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1883.52s)]
*  than their female counterparts. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1885.64s)]
*  You don't notice this as much because you don't have kids, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1887.52s)]
*  but I have a 14 year old. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  My 14 year old just had a Halloween party, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1891.76s)]
*  15 boys, 15 girls, the boys are 14. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1893.52s)]
*  A couple of the girls look like they could be [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1896.24s)]
*  the junior senator from Pennsylvania. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1897.62s)]
*  They look 35 and they act that way. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1899.72s)]
*  They act that mature, they literally mature faster. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1902.48s)]
*  I think if a college isn't growing its freshmen seats [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1905.46s)]
*  faster than population, it should lose its tax free status [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1907.68s)]
*  because it's no longer a public service. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1911.4s)]
*  It's a hedge fund with classes. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1913.2s)]
*  I'm a big fan of the idea of mandatory national service. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1915.3s)]
*  I've spent some time in Israel recently, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1918.44s)]
*  despite the existential threats and the problems in Israel. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1920.88s)]
*  There's less young adult depression in Israel [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1924.4s)]
*  than almost any Western country. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1926.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think it's because of national service. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1928.4s)]
*  They're serving the agency of something bigger [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1930.1200000000001s)]
*  than themselves, they're outside, they're in great shape. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1931.96s)]
*  They're learning how to handle weapons, equipment. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1934.8400000000001s)]
*  It's where they meet co-founders of businesses. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1937.7600000000002s)]
*  It's where they make lifelong friends. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1940.0s)]
*  It's where they meet potential mates. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1941.3200000000002s)]
*  So I think mandatory national service would be huge for us. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1943.2800000000002s)]
*  Many of you know that I used to have a job in my hometown [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1946.96s)]
*  and it was off the books. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1950.32s)]
*  I would clean the coins out of wishing wells [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1952.24s)]
*  for the city of Covington. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=1954.76s)]

*  then you're not even gonna be welcome at school. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2141.4399999999996s)]
*  No, there's. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2143.6s)]
*  And I don't know if that's true, I don't talk to kids. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2144.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't know that, but it's like, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2147.04s)]
*  you know, you get this feeling sometimes like, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2149.04s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2152.72s)]
*  Well, to your point, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2154.72s)]
*  did you have the presidential fitness awards [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2156.4399999999996s)]
*  when you were in? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2158.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2159.04s)]
*  I got badge one, you got a number on. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2159.96s)]
*  I got badge one, badge two, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2162.12s)]
*  and I had a growth spurt and I couldn't do the pull-ups. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2163.2s)]
*  And I trained for a year, pull-ups, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2165.8399999999997s)]
*  and I got strong again. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2168.12s)]
*  And now the awards were done away with [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2169.6s)]
*  because it was sauce fat shaming. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2171.96s)]
*  So, and if you walk down the halls of NYU, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2174.08s)]
*  you're gonna see all these support groups for women. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2179.08s)]
*  You know, black women in consulting, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2179.92s)]
*  golden seeds, women in venture capital. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2181.48s)]
*  There are no support groups for men. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2183.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2185.12s)]
*  And I don't think men have a place in our political world. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2185.96s)]
*  I think the far right is kind of telling men to be, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2188.52s)]
*  quite frankly, a little bit coarse and cruel. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  It's toughness and strength gone a little bit overboard. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2194.52s)]
*  But on the far left, their definition of masculinity [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2197.4s)]
*  and their advice to men is to be more like a woman. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2201.04s)]
*  That doesn't work either. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2204.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2205.52s)]
*  So we need to re-embrace the notion. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2206.36s)]
*  I mean, I say jokingly, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2207.6s)]
*  when Russian troops come pouring over the Ukrainian border, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2209.44s)]
*  you want some of that big dick energy. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2212.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2214.6s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being physically strong. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2215.8s)]
*  I think any man under the age of 30, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2219.8s)]
*  our bone structure and that double twitch muscle [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2221.88s)]
*  with this amazing substance called testosterone [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2225.4s)]
*  poured over it is a fucking amazing thing. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2228.48s)]
*  You're gonna look back on your physique right now [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2230.4s)]
*  and your strength, and you're gonna wish, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2232.52s)]
*  and you kind of look this way, that you were a monster. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2234.6s)]
*  Any man under the age of 30 should be able [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2236.52s)]
*  to walk into any room and know that if shit got real, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2238.2s)]
*  they could either kill and eat everybody or outrun them. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2241.04s)]
*  And that is a wonderful feeling. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2244.24s)]
*  It'll make you less prone to mental illness. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  It'll make you more attractive to mates, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  less likely to be depressed. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2249.0s)]
*  And you'll be that guy that breaks up fights at bars, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2250.52s)]
*  not that's insecure, right? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2253.6s)]
*  This is strength, re-embracing strength, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2255.8s)]
*  re-embracing protection, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2258.68s)]
*  re-embracing, initiating relationships. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2260.48s)]
*  I forced my kids, I don't do this anymore [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2262.84s)]
*  because I've had enough of it, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2265.72s)]
*  but when we left the house, I used to say, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2266.68s)]
*  I'm not gonna let them back in [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2268.0s)]
*  unless they talk to a stranger. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2268.84s)]
*  And it was easy for one of them. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2270.92s)]
*  It was hard for the other. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2272.96s)]
*  I'm like, just go up to them and pet their dog [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2274.12s)]
*  and say what kind of dog it is. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2275.96s)]
*  Because your ability to initiate contact [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2277.72s)]
*  is key to finding a job. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2280.96s)]
*  It's not easy to email strangers [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2283.4s)]
*  or go into a strange interview. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2285.72s)]
*  Your ability to express interest, romantic interest, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2287.2s)]
*  while making someone feel safe, right? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2289.84s)]
*  Demonstrating excellence. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2292.76s)]
*  Where does a guy demonstrate excellence right now? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2294.04s)]
*  Doesn't go into work, doesn't go to church, right? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2296.4s)]
*  Isn't playing sports, right? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2299.4s)]
*  Isn't going to college. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2301.2400000000002s)]
*  So where do men demonstrate excellence [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2302.28s)]
*  and attach to relationships? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2304.28s)]
*  But there is, we talk a lot about misogyny. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2306.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a huge problem. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2309.84s)]
*  It has been for a long time. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2310.92s)]
*  What we don't talk about is misandry. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2312.08s)]
*  And that is- [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2315.2000000000003s)]
*  What is misandry? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2316.04s)]
*  A hate of men. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2316.88s)]
*  There's generally- [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2318.7200000000003s)]
*  If you were to talk, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2320.56s)]
*  have you ever heard the term toxic femininity? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2321.4s)]
*  People don't use that term. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2323.52s)]
*  But toxic masculinity, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2324.88s)]
*  it's almost like it's become one word. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2326.16s)]
*  Oh, I feel, there are places I feel embarrassed even being [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2328.52s)]
*  because I feel like people look at me and think like, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2331.08s)]
*  oh, this guy thinks he's some kind of man or something. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2333.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2336.44s)]
*  That would be true. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2337.7599999999998s)]
*  But that happens to me in New York City sometimes. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2339.24s)]
*  You feel that way here. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2341.48s)]
*  Yep, there's certain places I'll walk in [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2342.48s)]
*  and just by the ambiance of like, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2344.16s)]
*  the people that work there or something, I'll think that. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2346.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm not saying that that's real, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2348.88s)]
*  but it could just be perceived in my head. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2351.4s)]
*  But I'll feel like I almost have to play down being a man [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2353.7200000000003s)]
*  or to probably be like accepted in this space, you know? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2356.36s)]
*  Or feel welcome here. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2360.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely, but there's definitely, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2363.08s)]
*  and if you look at the stats though, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2366.2400000000002s)]
*  men are really struggling. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2369.96s)]
*  Like we don't have a male homeless problem. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2371.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, we don't have a homeless problem. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2372.8s)]
*  We have a male homeless problem. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2374.1600000000003s)]
*  We have an opiate problem, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2375.76s)]
*  but we really have a male opiate problem. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2377.36s)]
*  Three out of four homeless, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2379.1200000000003s)]
*  three out of four addicts are men. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2380.4s)]
*  And if you had four out of five people kill themselves, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2383.48s)]
*  they were in any one special interest group, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2386.84s)]
*  we would do something about it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2389.04s)]
*  And there's a lack of empathy. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2390.2400000000002s)]
*  Because of the 2000 year head start we've had on women, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2391.6000000000004s)]
*  there's a lack of empathy for men. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2394.6800000000003s)]
*  Who had it mended? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2395.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, we've been. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2396.92s)]
*  How? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2397.76s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2398.6000000000004s)]
*  Even when I grew up, Theo, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2399.44s)]
*  when I came of professional age in the 90s, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2402.2000000000003s)]
*  98% at least of venture capital [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2404.8s)]
*  went to the 24% of the population [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2407.8s)]
*  that were white heterosexual males. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2410.28s)]
*  Okay, so men had that, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2412.4s)]
*  I see what you're talking about. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2413.7200000000003s)]
*  Until the last 30 years, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2414.6800000000003s)]
*  men have had literally a 2000 year head start. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2416.2400000000002s)]
*  But because of my advantage, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2419.1600000000003s)]
*  does that mean a 19 year old male should be punished for it? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2421.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2423.5600000000004s)]
*  There just isn't a recognition that a 19 year old male [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2424.4s)]
*  with a single mother in Appalachia, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2427.32s)]
*  he's got no advantage. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2430.0800000000004s)]
*  As a matter of fact, he's kind of disadvantaged right now. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2431.7200000000003s)]
*  There's certainly an attack on white males, it feels like. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2434.88s)]
*  And then if you're white, you can't be like, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2437.48s)]
*  hey, can we do a white help group? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2439.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2441.84s)]
*  Because suddenly you're racist. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2442.7599999999998s)]
*  There's definitely this shaming of being in white skin. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2444.32s)]
*  And it's like, we're constantly doing that. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2449.16s)]
*  Reliving the past or refocusing on the past [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2451.52s)]
*  and using it as a scope to aim at the present. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2454.56s)]
*  And it's not very fair. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2457.88s)]
*  And I definitely see it as a lot of people feel embarrassed [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2460.0s)]
*  to be white. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2463.2s)]
*  And that's a shame, because you didn't choose to be white. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2466.04s)]
*  And a lot of people, white people, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2469.64s)]
*  we didn't have shit, dude. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2470.9199999999996s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2472.0s)]
*  Like at least when I was growing up, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2472.8399999999997s)]
*  I felt like if you were black, people like, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2473.8799999999997s)]
*  you at least had the like, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2476.7599999999998s)]
*  well, I'm fucked because of society. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2479.08s)]
*  But if you were white, you're just like, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2481.7599999999998s)]
*  people were like, you didn't even have an excuse. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2483.24s)]
*  If you weren't doing good. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2486.08s)]
*  You're like, well, how'd you not do good? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2487.48s)]
*  You know, you're like, I don't know. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2489.3999999999996s)]
*  It's a nuanced conversation though, Theo, because. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2490.64s)]
*  I know it's nuanced. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2493.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm kind of generalized [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2494.0800000000004s)]
*  and I'm not trying to correlate anything. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2495.36s)]
*  I'm just saying, yeah, you can't make a, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2496.6400000000003s)]
*  hey, white people need help also group. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  But we're talking about the bias against males. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2501.1200000000003s)]
*  Our education system, the business I'm in [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2503.6000000000004s)]
*  is highly biased against men or boys. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2505.36s)]
*  70 to 80% of primary school teachers are women. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2508.1600000000003s)]
*  Who are they gonna naturally champion? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2511.8s)]
*  Someone who reminds them of themselves. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2513.1200000000003s)]
*  What are the behaviors we promote in school? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2514.6400000000003s)]
*  Be organized, be a pleaser, sit still. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2517.4s)]
*  You're basically describing a girl. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2519.76s)]
*  They're more per capita female fighter pilots [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2521.24s)]
*  than there are male kindergarten teachers. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2523.4799999999996s)]
*  We don't need male kindergarten teachers, I don't think. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2526.04s)]
*  Oh, sure we do. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2528.12s)]
*  You think so? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2529.08s)]
*  Young men need male role models. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2529.9199999999996s)]
*  Right, I agree with that. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  I think we need a PE teacher with some short shorts, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2532.56s)]
*  you know, those hands kind of, you know, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2535.08s)]
*  who doesn't wanna go home to his wife. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2537.2s)]
*  But I don't know if we need, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2539.6s)]
*  if I'd have walked into a kindergarten, you know. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2541.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, but I still keep in touch with a lot of my teachers. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2544.56s)]
*  I had a lot of affinity for them, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2546.3599999999997s)]
*  whether they were male or women. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  I did have male middle school teachers. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2548.96s)]
*  I don't know what I'd be alarmed [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2551.48s)]
*  if there was a male kindergarten teacher. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2552.68s)]
*  But an example of that, the bias. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2553.92s)]
*  A boy is on a risk, on a behavior adjusted basis [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2556.0s)]
*  is twice as likely to be suspended. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2559.16s)]
*  You have a girl and a boy two different times, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2561.2400000000002s)]
*  same infraction, cheating on the chemistry test. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2563.92s)]
*  The boy is twice as likely to be suspended as the girl. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2566.68s)]
*  The black boy is five times as likely to be suspended. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2570.16s)]
*  So a lot of the issues we're talking about, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2572.88s)]
*  self-harm, depression, lack of success in school [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2575.04s)]
*  is really difficult among young boys [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2581.28s)]
*  and it's even more acute among non-white. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2583.96s)]
*  Now, when you get to college, the whole DEI thing, right? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2586.44s)]
*  60 years ago, there were only 12 black people [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2591.2s)]
*  at Princeton, Harvard and Yale combined. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2593.76s)]
*  That was a problem. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2595.6s)]
*  So giving them the advantage or a lift up [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2597.0s)]
*  with race-based affirmative action [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2600.08s)]
*  was the right thing to do 60 years ago. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2602.08s)]
*  Now, this year, two thirds of Harvard's freshman class [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2604.08s)]
*  identifies as non-white. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2607.68s)]
*  70% of those people, however, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2609.96s)]
*  come from dual parent upper income homes. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2611.88s)]
*  So when you're letting in the daughter [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2614.48s)]
*  of a private equity Taiwanese billionaire, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2616.4s)]
*  that's not diversity, that's not helping anybody. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2618.64s)]
*  So what I would argue is affirmative action [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2621.56s)]
*  is a wonderful thing, but it should be based on color, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2623.88s)]
*  but that color is green. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2625.88s)]
*  And that as a white kid from Appalachia, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2627.72s)]
*  I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2631.2s)]
*  I got Pellgrant's in 1994. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2633.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, I got him. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2635.96s)]
*  There you go. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2637.16s)]
*  I think that's the way to go [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2638.0s)]
*  because the wonderful thing about America today, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2639.2400000000002s)]
*  and we don't celebrate America's progress enough, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2641.4s)]
*  young people want to shitpost it [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2643.76s)]
*  as if we've made no progress. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2645.12s)]
*  We've made extraordinary progress. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2646.6s)]
*  And as fucked up as we are, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2648.64s)]
*  we're less fucked up than I believe any nation in the world, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2650.04s)]
*  you would rather be born in America, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2652.8s)]
*  and this is a good thing. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2654.52s)]
*  You'd rather be born today, and the stats show this, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2655.36s)]
*  you'd rather be born gay or non-white than poor. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2658.12s)]
*  The people who need a hand up, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2661.4s)]
*  the best way to identify who is most screwed [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2663.96s)]
*  and is gonna face the biggest obstacles [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2665.9199999999996s)]
*  and deserves the most additional resources [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2667.64s)]
*  and kind of unfair help is a poor kid. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2670.24s)]
*  We need to get out of identity politics [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2673.56s)]
*  and focus on economics. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2675.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2677.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point, man. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2678.68s)]
*  I don't know how, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2679.9199999999996s)]
*  I know we're looking at a lot of the issues. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2682.68s)]
*  It's like, how do we get into solution [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2685.24s)]
*  and also keep it positive? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2690.7999999999997s)]
*  Because sometimes I'll get in this space [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2693.48s)]
*  where I'm just looking at the problems, right? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2694.32s)]
*  So how do I start looking at the solutions to like, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2696.8s)]
*  I mean, I guess you said like, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2699.1200000000003s)]
*  you can get involved in your community. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2700.44s)]
*  You can try to take care of yourself as a young man, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2702.08s)]
*  but then it just also feels like a ton of pressure [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2705.08s)]
*  on young men, you know? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2707.08s)]
*  Yeah, but you feel that pressure, right? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2708.96s)]
*  I mean, you're here in New York, you gotta get gas. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2710.6800000000003s)]
*  You gotta, you feel pressure, I'm sure. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2712.7200000000003s)]
*  That's part of it. Oh yeah, I definitely feel pressure. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2715.1600000000003s)]
*  I guess I'm thinking like as a young man, you know? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2716.6800000000003s)]
*  Like how do you start to create masculinity [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2719.2400000000002s)]
*  if you were just a young, if you're, you know, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2721.28s)]
*  say you're 20 years old and you were raised [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2723.6400000000003s)]
*  by a single mother and you're out in college right now, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2726.6800000000003s)]
*  how do you start to, I guess, define your world of, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2729.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, staying, feeling masculine [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2732.6800000000003s)]
*  and creating more masculinity in your life? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2734.4s)]
*  And maybe you've outlined some of those things already, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2736.1200000000003s)]
*  you know? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2737.88s)]
*  I think again, it's come back, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2739.0s)]
*  masculinity is a social construct. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2740.44s)]
*  We get to decide what it is. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2742.28s)]
*  And by the way, it's not sequestered to people [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2743.36s)]
*  just born as males. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2745.88s)]
*  I used, before my shoulders got all fucked up, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2747.0400000000004s)]
*  I used to get a CrossFit. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2749.5600000000004s)]
*  And I noticed over 20 years, more and more women showing up. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2751.92s)]
*  Some women demonstrate wonderful masculinity. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2754.72s)]
*  I'm drawn to men. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2757.68s)]
*  My closest friends are more feminine. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2758.52s)]
*  They're more caring. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2760.2799999999997s)]
*  I have male friends who kind of take care of me. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2761.36s)]
*  So, but I think using those things as a code [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2764.12s)]
*  could be a great guidepost for young men, right? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2768.04s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with wanting to make money. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2771.08s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with wanting to be strong. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2773.72s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with wanting to have sex [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2775.48s)]
*  to find romantic and sexual partners. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2778.2s)]
*  And using that as a guide, why are women, for example, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2780.6s)]
*  why are women drawn to men? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2783.56s)]
*  What are they attracted to in reverse order? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2786.0s)]
*  And there's research around this. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2788.6s)]
*  Number three, kindness. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2789.6s)]
*  They want a guy that's nice to his parents. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2791.3999999999996s)]
*  They want a guy that treats strangers well. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2793.2799999999997s)]
*  They want a guy that thinks about other people [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2795.56s)]
*  even when they're not in front of them, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2797.44s)]
*  that treats them well even though [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2798.56s)]
*  they'll never see them again. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2799.6s)]
*  Number two is intellect. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2801.2s)]
*  And this goes way back anthropologically. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2802.92s)]
*  The guy who makes good decisions for the tribe, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2804.8399999999997s)]
*  the tribe's more likely to survive. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2807.48s)]
*  At some point, typically throughout history, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  women are much more vulnerable because they give birth [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2811.76s)]
*  and they're much more physically vulnerable. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2814.0s)]
*  So a woman wants a man who is smart [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2816.2s)]
*  and makes good decisions. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2818.12s)]
*  By the way, the fastest way to communicate intellect [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2818.96s)]
*  is humor. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2822.04s)]
*  I jokingly say my impression of a woman is, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2824.0s)]
*  I'm laughing, I'm laughing, I'm naked. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2826.0s)]
*  If you can make a woman laugh. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2827.76s)]
*  If you can make a woman laugh. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2830.04s)]
*  Look at you, you're looking guilty. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2832.16s)]
*  No, I'm thinking this, I'm laughing, I'm laughing, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2833.64s)]
*  and then, oh, you're missing. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2835.64s)]
*  That's more, because it's like, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2839.64s)]
*  I'll always won't close a deal. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2840.6s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2842.16s)]
*  I'll literally be fucking. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2843.0s)]
*  I don't buy that from her. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2844.6s)]
*  I'll stand on the curb and I will not get in the Uber, dude. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2845.44s)]
*  I just, I mean, I get afraid. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2848.24s)]
*  The other day I talked to some girl, right? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2851.4s)]
*  I saw her at the freaking Whole Foods, dude. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2852.7799999999997s)]
*  She was getting, I thought it was spaghetti or something. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2855.52s)]
*  I was like, oh, you like spaghetti? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2857.7999999999997s)]
*  But I had looked at the wrong thing or whatever [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2859.48s)]
*  and she was buying flowers, right? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2860.92s)]
*  And she's like, what is this guy talking about? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2862.08s)]
*  But I guess she thought it was cute or whatever. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2863.64s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, do you know [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2866.32s)]
*  if there's a hot bar around here? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2867.36s)]
*  And she goes, it's on the other side. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2869.28s)]
*  So I went, then I'm like, fuck, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2870.68s)]
*  now I have to go to the other side, away from her, right? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2872.08s)]
*  Then she comes over there and I'm like, this is it. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2875.04s)]
*  And then I just kept looking at her [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2878.6s)]
*  and then she left. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2880.88s)]
*  Yeah, but this is a good segue to the number one thing [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2883.68s)]
*  and that is the ability to signal resources. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2886.32s)]
*  And it's not necessarily you have to be a baller [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2889.18s)]
*  at that moment, but you have to have a plan. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2890.72s)]
*  You have to be the guy that's disciplined. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2893.36s)]
*  One of the reasons women are attracted to men [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2894.98s)]
*  who are in good shape is it shows you show up. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2897.02s)]
*  It shows you have discipline. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2899.42s)]
*  So if I could give you any advice [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2900.54s)]
*  in that specific situation, it would be, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2902.86s)]
*  oh, hi, are those flowers? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2904.82s)]
*  By the way, I have one of the 10 biggest podcasts [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2906.22s)]
*  in the world. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2908.1s)]
*  Boss, that's how, anyways, but you get my meaning. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2910.3s)]
*  Three, kindness, two, intellect, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2914.5s)]
*  and one, your ability to signal resources. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2916.38s)]
*  I see. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2918.62s)]
*  Would you like to go to Holland [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2919.46s)]
*  where they have tulips year round? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2920.5s)]
*  I could say that. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2922.9s)]
*  I'm leaving tomorrow. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2923.7400000000002s)]
*  And then I'm not, but still. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2925.34s)]
*  Take her to holland.com. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2928.44s)]
*  I already got that. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2930.2999999999997s)]
*  But still, yeah, that could be interesting. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2931.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think there is that, but yeah, that confidence. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2933.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a good point to signal [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2935.58s)]
*  that you just have confidence in yourself. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2938.02s)]
*  That's really what that is, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2939.62s)]
*  is just saying I have some confidence enough in myself. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2941.8199999999997s)]
*  And sometimes I will make the extra step, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2944.2999999999997s)]
*  but it's just like, I have to just practice it more. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2946.52s)]
*  And I have to realize that if that one girl says no, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2948.7s)]
*  it's not that every girl's saying no, man, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2950.7799999999997s)]
*  that this is just a- [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2952.38s)]
*  Huge point. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2953.58s)]
*  It's just a momentary challenge. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2955.74s)]
*  What would you say to mothers who have children, right? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2957.46s)]
*  Single mothers who have children, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2960.66s)]
*  how can they do that for their kids? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2961.7799999999997s)]
*  One thing that I will think is put your kid [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2963.62s)]
*  into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu class. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2965.8199999999997s)]
*  I think it was the best place that I ever went. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2968.7799999999997s)]
*  I trained for maybe a year and a half, right? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2971.34s)]
*  It was the first place I ever went [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2974.08s)]
*  where you would be wrestling one second, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2976.14s)]
*  but then having an emotional conversation [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2979.22s)]
*  with somebody the next second. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2981.06s)]
*  Because it was very- [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2982.5s)]
*  You and Lex Friedman, you're both really into Jiu-Jitsu, right? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2983.34s)]
*  No, he's really, he's still doing it, practicing, right? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2985.98s)]
*  I just kept getting hurt so bad [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2988.66s)]
*  and it was affecting my ability to work. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2990.22s)]
*  But it was like, you were like monkeys, you know? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2993.06s)]
*  Like you would be battling against somebody, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2995.46s)]
*  but even if you lost, they still cared about you. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=2999.28s)]
*  So there was this element of safety [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3001.3s)]
*  that you started to learn, right? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3002.94s)]
*  And that felt like years of manhood [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3005.0s)]
*  in months that I was learning. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3008.16s)]
*  But you said something really important, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3009.82s)]
*  and that is I was asked, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3011.34s)]
*  so I'm an entrepreneur, I've registered some success, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3015.34s)]
*  and I get a lot, what's the secret to your success? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, one, it was being smart enough [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3019.1000000000004s)]
*  to be born in America. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3021.38s)]
*  There's just more opportunity. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3022.58s)]
*  You'd rather be good in America [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3023.7000000000003s)]
*  than great in almost any other country. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3024.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3026.54s)]
*  There really is, you have more agency here [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3027.38s)]
*  if you work hard and you're a good person [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3030.38s)]
*  to be successful than any place in the world. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3031.94s)]
*  And none of that was my fault. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3034.86s)]
*  It was my parents' fault. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3036.34s)]
*  They got on a ship, a steam ship in the 60s from Europe, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3037.34s)]
*  take a huge risk, which paid huge benefit for me. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3040.58s)]
*  I came of professional age in California [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3043.5s)]
*  where I got free education that was accessible. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3045.18s)]
*  Came of age in the internet. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3047.34s)]
*  And when I was your age, I was like, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3049.22s)]
*  all my success in my mind was because of my character [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3050.46s)]
*  and my grit. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3053.1s)]
*  And then as you get older, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3054.02s)]
*  you realize a lot of your success isn't your fault. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3054.84s)]
*  But if I've done one thing well, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3057.12s)]
*  it's what I call failure. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3059.1s)]
*  And that is I ran for sophomore, junior, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3061.94s)]
*  and senior class presidents. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3065.54s)]
*  I lost three times. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3066.74s)]
*  And based on my track record, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3068.1s)]
*  I decided to run for student body president [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3069.34s)]
*  where I went on to wait for it, lose. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3071.26s)]
*  I've started nine businesses, seven have failed. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3074.26s)]
*  I can't tell you how many women in Whole Foods [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3077.86s)]
*  and other places and other retail establishments [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3079.98s)]
*  I've been rejected by. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3081.78s)]
*  But the reason I get to live the life I lead, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3083.6600000000003s)]
*  the reason I'm with a very high character attractive person [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3086.7400000000002s)]
*  is because I have always been able to endure rejection. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3090.42s)]
*  And that is the key. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3094.58s)]
*  That is the skill. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3095.54s)]
*  Because one of the great things about America [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3096.38s)]
*  is we don't embrace failure. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3097.98s)]
*  That's bullshit, but we tolerate it. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3099.86s)]
*  If your business fails, but you're a good person, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3101.3399999999997s)]
*  usually your investors will back you again. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3103.6s)]
*  And if you approach a woman and express interest [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3105.8199999999997s)]
*  and she's not interested, you're both gonna be fine. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3108.2999999999997s)]
*  And show me a guy, show me a guy. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3111.94s)]
*  We all know that guy. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3115.2599999999998s)]
*  You think, okay, he's a nice guy. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3116.2999999999997s)]
*  He's modestly successful. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3118.46s)]
*  He's not that attractive. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3120.2999999999997s)]
*  And he's with just such a high quality woman. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3121.86s)]
*  That guy is not afraid of rejection. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3125.2799999999997s)]
*  That guy cycled through nine women who said, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3127.74s)]
*  get the fuck away from me, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3129.8599999999997s)]
*  before he found that one woman who gave him a chance [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3131.7799999999997s)]
*  to be funny, kind. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3134.74s)]
*  She was drawn to his smell. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3136.9399999999996s)]
*  She liked the way he treated his parents. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3138.3399999999997s)]
*  The key to success in America [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3140.8199999999997s)]
*  is what Winston Churchill said. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3143.22s)]
*  And that is the willingness to fail [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3144.58s)]
*  or your ability to fail [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3147.14s)]
*  and not lose your sense of enthusiasm. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3148.4199999999996s)]
*  And the one thing about Jiu-Jitsu and about sports [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3150.8599999999997s)]
*  is quite frankly, it teaches you how to lose [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3153.02s)]
*  and show up the next day. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3155.74s)]
*  So I think you gotta put your kids [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3158.22s)]
*  and mothers gotta put their sons in an environment [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3160.5s)]
*  where they- [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3163.4599999999996s)]
*  This is off and it's ringing. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3164.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's the government. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3165.12s)]
*  That's the government. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3166.4599999999996s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3167.2999999999997s)]
*  It happens a lot. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3169.2999999999997s)]
*  Go on. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3170.5s)]
*  Anyways, your willingness or your resilience, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3171.3399999999997s)]
*  your ability to move through rejection [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3174.3399999999997s)]
*  without losing your sense of enthusiasm. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3176.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3178.4199999999996s)]
*  A lot of times when I would, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3179.2599999999998s)]
*  if I felt rejection, it attached to some old feelings [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3180.08s)]
*  inside of myself that were of rejection. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3182.7s)]
*  And that would be, it felt demoralizing at times. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3185.02s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3189.02s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen those guys who are like, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3190.46s)]
*  how did that guy do it? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3192.14s)]
*  How did he figure it out? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3193.7s)]
*  How was he able to just show up for himself [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3195.94s)]
*  in the face of rejection? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3198.82s)]
*  But I bet rejection does get easier [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3199.86s)]
*  the more you start to swim in it. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3201.92s)]
*  You realize that, I mean, here's the thing. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3204.46s)]
*  So I know you're religious. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3206.88s)]
*  I'm an atheist. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3208.06s)]
*  I think at some point I'm gonna look into my kid's eyes [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3209.14s)]
*  and know our relationship is coming to an end. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3211.58s)]
*  And it's empowering. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3214.32s)]
*  It's one of the biggest unlocks in my life [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3215.88s)]
*  because I realize if I fuck up on this podcast [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3218.0800000000004s)]
*  and you don't think a lot of me, I'm bummed, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3221.92s)]
*  but you're gonna be dead soon. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3224.36s)]
*  And so am I. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3225.96s)]
*  It really doesn't matter. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3227.1200000000003s)]
*  Everything we're worried about, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3228.96s)]
*  we're a group of mites on an unremarkable rock [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3230.8s)]
*  in one of a billion universes in 10 billion galaxies. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3233.6800000000003s)]
*  We're not even here for the blink of an eye. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3237.32s)]
*  So why on earth wouldn't you squeeze as much lemon [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3238.88s)]
*  or juice out of this lemon as possible? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3243.8s)]
*  Because the moment you think [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3246.44s)]
*  you've done something embarrassing, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3247.88s)]
*  the moment you're worried about approaching [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3249.2000000000003s)]
*  that woman at Whole Foods, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3250.7200000000003s)]
*  everyone who saw you, everyone you're worried about, she, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3252.76s)]
*  they go on to thinking about themselves right away. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3256.0600000000004s)]
*  And it doesn't matter [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3259.2200000000003s)]
*  because you're both gonna be dead soon. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3260.1000000000004s)]
*  I find that liberating. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3262.2000000000003s)]
*  Why wouldn't you go up to someone [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3263.76s)]
*  and tell them you admire them? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3265.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's also an unlock for me emotionally. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3266.2000000000003s)]
*  I started telling people I love them. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3268.28s)]
*  I started telling people I care about them. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3269.94s)]
*  I started, when I was single, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3272.2s)]
*  going up to people outside of my weight class [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3273.72s)]
*  and telling them I was interested in them romantically. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3276.08s)]
*  Most of the time they'd say no. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3279.04s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3280.16s)]
*  We're both gonna be fine [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3281.0s)]
*  because we're both gonna be dead, Theo. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3281.8199999999997s)]
*  It doesn't really matter. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3283.3599999999997s)]
*  So this ability to get back your embarrassment, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3285.2s)]
*  get over your fear, for me, that sounds strange, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3287.6s)]
*  but it comes from a recognition [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3291.7599999999998s)]
*  that I'm just not gonna be here that long [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3294.16s)]
*  and either or they, it's this enormous unlock. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3296.16s)]
*  Because if you think about what you said about, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3299.5s)]
*  I mean, for God's sakes, you're like this baller. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3302.26s)]
*  You're a handsome guy who's got a top 10 podcast [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3304.62s)]
*  and you're intimidated by some woman at Whole Foods. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3307.78s)]
*  Can you imagine how most men feel? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3310.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3312.6s)]
*  So what you gotta do is, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3313.44s)]
*  what I'm trying to do with my sons [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3314.62s)]
*  is I'm trying to encourage them to say, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3315.98s)]
*  okay, get up, talk to strangers, talk to strange women. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3317.34s)]
*  Also, kind of a segue here, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3322.8s)]
*  try and modulate your use of porn [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3325.1s)]
*  such that at some point you become so fucking horny [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3327.1s)]
*  that you're willing to take those risks. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3330.26s)]
*  Yeah, now that's it. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3331.1s)]
*  We can definitely go there, brother. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3331.94s)]
*  Because yeah, I think that was something [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3334.5s)]
*  that I got sidetracked with pornography for sure, man. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3336.1s)]
*  And I'll tell you why too. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3339.58s)]
*  For pornography, for me, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3341.9s)]
*  it was a relationship that I could manage. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3343.1800000000003s)]
*  It was the first kind of interaction with women, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3345.3s)]
*  it felt like, that I could manage this. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3347.26s)]
*  It's like- [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3349.3s)]
*  It's low risk. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3350.1400000000003s)]
*  It's low risk. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3350.98s)]
*  It's available when you need it to start [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3351.82s)]
*  and when you need it to stop. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3354.1400000000003s)]
*  It was like, that was something [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3355.58s)]
*  that was very manageable for me. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3357.86s)]
*  But then over time, it starts, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3359.3s)]
*  you realize that it kind of devalues women. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3360.6600000000003s)]
*  It makes you think of sex [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3362.58s)]
*  in just like still frames and instances, right? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3363.6600000000003s)]
*  And you would see sex as individual scenes of things. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3366.58s)]
*  I would have a date set up, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3370.1800000000003s)]
*  then I would end up masturbating [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3371.9s)]
*  and then I wouldn't even go on the date. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3374.2200000000003s)]
*  Because I was like, well, now I don't feel [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3375.86s)]
*  any fire inside of me. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3376.9s)]
*  Who's your mojo? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3378.34s)]
*  Yeah, and then you do that for a decade [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3379.1800000000003s)]
*  and your mojo is a ghost. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3381.98s)]
*  We were talking about school and society [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3384.58s)]
*  and a bias against men that hurts men, right? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3388.18s)]
*  And what I would say is [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3393.98s)]
*  that one of the biggest obstacles men face right now [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3396.2999999999997s)]
*  is the most talented, deepest resource companies in the world [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3399.14s)]
*  that attract the brightest minds [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3402.62s)]
*  and the most capital and have the best technology [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3404.06s)]
*  are all trying to do the same thing. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3406.42s)]
*  They're all trying to give men the false impression [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3408.3799999999997s)]
*  they can have a reasonable facsimile of life [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3410.3399999999997s)]
*  on a screen with an algorithm. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3412.7s)]
*  You don't need friends. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3414.3399999999997s)]
*  With a facsimile, I'm sorry. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3415.18s)]
*  They can have a fake life. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3416.2999999999997s)]
*  They can have a life on a screen with an algorithm. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3418.06s)]
*  So you don't need friends. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3421.7799999999997s)]
*  Having friends is hard. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3422.9399999999996s)]
*  Remember making your posse of friends [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3423.8199999999997s)]
*  in elementary and junior high, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3426.06s)]
*  trying to break into the right pecking order of friends. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3427.8199999999997s)]
*  It was high barriers of entry, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3431.2599999999998s)]
*  but it was high barriers of exit, right? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3432.5s)]
*  And you learned a lot together. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3434.7799999999997s)]
*  And we used to take off, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3436.02s)]
*  I think parents overprotect their kids now. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3437.98s)]
*  I used to leave my mom's house at nine in the morning [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3439.58s)]
*  on a Saturday with a Schwinn bike and Abba's Abba bar [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3441.78s)]
*  and 35 cents and she wouldn't see me for 14 hours. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3445.0600000000004s)]
*  But what are tech companies? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3448.38s)]
*  What are the brightest companies in the world [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3449.98s)]
*  that are the most well-resourced? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3451.42s)]
*  You don't need friends. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3452.6600000000003s)]
*  You got Reddit and Discord. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3453.98s)]
*  You don't need to go through the humiliation [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3455.5400000000004s)]
*  of trying to get a job and buying a suit [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3457.1000000000004s)]
*  and showing up on time. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3459.3s)]
*  Trade crypto or stocks on Coinbase or Robinhood. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3461.2200000000003s)]
*  You don't need to go through the humiliation, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3464.78s)]
*  the rejection, the perseverance [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3466.94s)]
*  of trying to establish a romantic relationship [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3469.34s)]
*  going on dates, being funny, trying hard, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3471.54s)]
*  enduring rejection, following up. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3474.3s)]
*  Why? Why would you do that? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3476.38s)]
*  You got you porn. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3478.02s)]
*  And what we got to tell men, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3479.46s)]
*  what we got to convince them of is over the longterm, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3480.7s)]
*  nothing wonderful is going to happen to you on a screen ever. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3483.34s)]
*  And also you porn is a distant second to your porn. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3486.86s)]
*  I'm convinced I wouldn't have graduated from UCLA [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3491.5s)]
*  if I didn't think there was a reasonable probability [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3494.2599999999998s)]
*  that if I went to class and went on campus at UCLA, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3497.62s)]
*  I might meet someone. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3500.94s)]
*  That was my far. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3502.42s)]
*  And I quite frankly, if I had you porn at home [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3503.7000000000003s)]
*  and I had these new AI girlfriends, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3506.62s)]
*  I'm not sure I would have ever gone on campus. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3510.18s)]
*  So this is what young men are facing. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3513.2200000000003s)]
*  They're facing a low risk, low barrier of entry, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3515.1s)]
*  reasonable facsimile of life, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3519.18s)]
*  that over time they get depressed and lonely [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3521.54s)]
*  because the reason romantic comedies [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3524.18s)]
*  are two hours and not 15 minutes is this shit is hard. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3525.82s)]
*  But here's the good news. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3529.58s)]
*  It's worth it. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3530.58s)]
*  It's absolutely worth it. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3531.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, right now I think you have like, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3533.42s)]
*  even with like elections, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3534.94s)]
*  like you're almost people are trying to vote that back into, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3537.22s)]
*  I think there's a little bit of like, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3540.34s)]
*  well, we need to get something masculine going on, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3541.8199999999997s)]
*  because it's definitely this world, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3545.2999999999997s)]
*  it has a big labia on it, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3547.2599999999998s)]
*  and we need to, and that's fine. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3550.1s)]
*  You say that like it's a bad thing. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3552.7799999999997s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3553.9s)]
*  Look, we're happy with a decent amount of labia, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3554.94s)]
*  but we need to make sure it's, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3557.34s)]
*  hey, are you buying flowers? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3559.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3560.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3561.62s)]
*  Oh, that's pasta. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3563.02s)]
*  But here's what I think. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3565.54s)]
*  I think people are expecting the government to rescue them. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3566.5s)]
*  That's what I mean with some of the voting, right? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3570.18s)]
*  We want the, but how much of that [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3572.62s)]
*  is us having to govern ourselves [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3575.1s)]
*  and how much of that is, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3576.98s)]

*  like laws and stuff like that? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3581.18s)]
*  Like what is realistic of one to expect? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3582.86s)]
*  Well, does that make sense? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3585.7799999999997s)]
*  I've been thinking about this election. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3586.94s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3588.62s)]
*  But I've been thinking a lot about this election, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3590.18s)]
*  and I was vocal, I supported Harris. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3592.14s)]

*  She went seven of the, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3599.1s)]
*  she lost seven of the seven swing states. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3600.7s)]
*  As I looked at the data, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3602.7s)]
*  I would describe this election as the testosterone election. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3603.58s)]
*  And what do you have? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3607.94s)]
*  You have men doing more poorly, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3609.3399999999997s)]
*  men under the age of 30 doing more poorly [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3612.18s)]

*  And it all, the election all zeros down [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3616.3s)]
*  to one piece of data for me, or the results. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3618.7000000000003s)]

*  Not only your self-esteem, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3651.1s)]

*  and podcast clips and stuff like that more. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3864.5s)]
*  But it's also, you look at, Rogan used to be a Democrat, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3866.7400000000002s)]
*  he was a leftist. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3869.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm a Bernie fan. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3870.0600000000004s)]
*  It's like these people fucking alienated my heroes [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3871.02s)]
*  in the Democratic Party. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3874.34s)]
*  It's gotten like, you know, it's very bizarre. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3875.66s)]
*  I mean, the political part of it is very bizarre to me. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3879.3399999999997s)]
*  But I do think there's a lot about what you're saying [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3883.3399999999997s)]
*  is like, yeah, a man wants to feel like it's okay [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3885.1s)]
*  to be a man. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3887.1s)]
*  And you're like, sometimes you leave the house, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3888.74s)]
*  like, is it okay to be a man? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3890.5s)]
*  Do I have to put my, do I have to check my dick [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3891.7s)]
*  at the door of this restaurant or whatever? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3893.62s)]
*  Like, it feels like that sometimes, you know? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3895.3399999999997s)]
*  And it's not how somebody should feel. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3898.02s)]
*  So yeah, I think it's great that we're talking about this [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3900.18s)]
*  and that we're thinking about that stuff, you know? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3902.7s)]
*  What do you think of the effects of like social media [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3904.86s)]
*  are on young men? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3906.9s)]
*  Oh, it's a disaster. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3908.78s)]
*  There's my colleague at NYU, Jonathan Heide, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3910.6200000000003s)]
*  he wrote this book called The Anxious Generation. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3913.1400000000003s)]
*  Jonathan Heide? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3915.6200000000003s)]
*  Heide, Jonathan Heide, H-A-I-D-T. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3916.78s)]
*  Essentially, there's a lot of peer reviewed research, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3919.6200000000003s)]
*  including research that just came out of Oxford [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3921.58s)]
*  showing that there's about a 60% increase [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3923.3s)]
*  in self-harm, eating disorders, and anxiety for people [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3926.26s)]
*  who spend too much time on social media. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3930.42s)]
*  Imagine, did you have social media when you were in school? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3932.06s)]
*  No, dude, you had to yell at somebody, right? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3935.38s)]
*  But imagine the cafeteria. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3938.46s)]
*  Graffiti, that was the only social media you had, dude. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3940.34s)]
*  Graffiti? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3942.18s)]
*  You know, Larry likes dudes. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3943.02s)]
*  It was like, whoa, who knows, bro? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3944.58s)]
*  But it never told you their last name, it was very, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3946.9s)]
*  and it would be like, but now even graffiti, dude, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3949.58s)]
*  especially like in Brooklyn, it's so, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3952.2599999999998s)]
*  it's like Larry likes dudes, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3953.78s)]
*  but only if he's okay with it, I read that. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3955.18s)]
*  And I was like, that's not, what is it? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3957.2599999999998s)]
*  Everything's fucking confusing, dude. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3960.82s)]
*  Nobody cared if Larry liked dudes or not. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3962.5s)]
*  It was just the fact that somebody got to say it, you know? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3964.14s)]
*  And then now it's like, only if he's cool with it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3966.58s)]
*  It's like, who's right? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3968.66s)]
*  Anyway, what are you gonna say? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3970.1s)]
*  The bottom line, social media is bad. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3971.62s)]
*  It's bad for teen girls and it's bad, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3974.7400000000002s)]
*  really bad for young men. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3976.82s)]
*  There's a direct, there's a linear correlation [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3978.02s)]
*  between anxiety, eating disorders with young women, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3979.82s)]
*  anxiety with men, because it's like, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3982.7400000000002s)]
*  you never get to leave the high school cafeteria. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3984.86s)]
*  And it's especially hard on girls in high school [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3987.8199999999997s)]
*  because boys bully physically and verbally, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3990.7s)]
*  girls bully relationally, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3993.22s)]
*  and we put these nuclear weapons in their hands. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3994.54s)]
*  They're actually a little bit, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3996.46s)]
*  it can be a little bit meaner. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3997.8599999999997s)]
*  And so, and then you take online dating, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=3999.66s)]
*  anytime you digitize a sector, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4003.06s)]
*  it becomes a winner take most environment. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4005.7s)]
*  So- [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4008.14s)]
*  Okay, say that one more time. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4008.98s)]
*  Anytime you digitize a sector, like what does that mean? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4009.7999999999997s)]
*  Anytime a sector becomes all about the internet. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4012.14s)]
*  So retail used to be stores. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4015.2999999999997s)]
*  It becomes online. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4018.5s)]
*  Amazon now controls 50% of all e-commerce, right? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4019.34s)]
*  We used to go to the Encyclopedia Britannica [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4023.58s)]
*  to the library to Microfiche or to different newspapers. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4026.42s)]
*  Now we go to Google. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4028.62s)]
*  Google has 93% of search. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4029.86s)]
*  Facebook and Meta owns two thirds of all social media. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4033.98s)]
*  Online dating, everyone has access to everyone. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4037.62s)]
*  You think that's good? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4040.1s)]
*  It's not, because women all want the same dude. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4040.94s)]
*  And if you have 50 men on Tinder and 50 women, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4045.38s)]
*  46 of the women will show all of their attention [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4048.42s)]
*  to just four men. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4052.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4053.1400000000003s)]
*  So that leaves 46 men fighting over four women. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4053.98s)]
*  And the reality is those women can have sex [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4057.1600000000003s)]
*  with the top 10%, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4059.62s)]
*  but they're usually not gonna have a relationship. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4061.1s)]
*  And because that top 10% of men [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4062.78s)]
*  get 80 to 90% of the opportunities, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4064.96s)]
*  they can engage in what I refer to as Porsche polygamy. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4067.82s)]
*  And that is, it doesn't encourage long-term good behavior. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4070.58s)]
*  It doesn't encourage them to settle down. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4073.86s)]
*  Whereas when we were kids, you went to your church, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4075.78s)]
*  your temple, your high school, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4077.94s)]
*  and you kind of figured out your weight class. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4079.82s)]
*  There were eight single women at your temple, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4081.6200000000003s)]
*  eight single men, and you sort of paired off. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4083.78s)]
*  And men had an opportunity to demonstrate excellence [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4086.42s)]
*  at some point. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4088.78s)]
*  If you talk to married couples [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4089.6200000000003s)]
*  that have been together longer than 30 years, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4090.58s)]
*  75% of them say one was much more interested in the other [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4092.26s)]
*  and was always the man who was much more interested. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4095.6600000000003s)]
*  But over time, she saw that he was kind. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4099.14s)]
*  She worked with him. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4101.42s)]
*  He was good at what he did. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4102.42s)]
*  So where do men demonstrate excellence now? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4103.44s)]
*  And then a man goes online. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4105.919999999999s)]
*  Check out this stat. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4107.599999999999s)]
*  On Tinder, a man of average attractiveness [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4108.679999999999s)]
*  has to swipe right 200 times [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4111.879999999999s)]
*  to get one swipe back for one coffee. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4113.9s)]
*  And then four of five of those coffees will ghost him. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4116.599999999999s)]
*  Her screen will come up again, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4120.32s)]
*  and she'll decide not to show up for a coffee. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4121.679999999999s)]
*  So a guy of average attractiveness on a dating app [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4123.879999999999s)]
*  has to swipe right 1,000 times to get a coffee. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4127.0s)]
*  So he feels rejected by women. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4129.839999999999s)]
*  He becomes much more prone [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4132.08s)]
*  to misogynistic content online, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4133.44s)]
*  prone to conspiracy theory, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4135.48s)]
*  less likely to believe in climate change. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4136.96s)]
*  And he's hopped up on caffeine too, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4138.72s)]
*  because he's been fucking sitting there [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4140.2s)]
*  sipping by himself, you know? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4141.28s)]
*  In sum, he becomes a shitty citizen. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4143.2s)]
*  So social media and online dating [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4145.44s)]
*  have been really bad for young men and women. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4147.16s)]
*  I think online dating has been especially rough on men. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4149.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4153.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like to be online dating. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4153.92s)]
*  I haven't been on, I'm like seven years off of it. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4156.48s)]
*  Raya won't let me on there [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4159.72s)]
*  because I told an awesome joke on Twitter [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4160.82s)]
*  that they got offended by, I guess. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4162.58s)]
*  But I also, I didn't want somebody to be able to say no [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4165.86s)]
*  to me when I wasn't there in person. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4168.54s)]
*  That's how it felt to me. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4170.139999999999s)]
*  I just didn't want to give somebody that pleasure [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4171.54s)]
*  that they could say no. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4173.219999999999s)]
*  And even though it's not a real no, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4174.0599999999995s)]
*  it's all very hypothetical, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4176.0599999999995s)]
*  but I just didn't want to allow somebody to have that. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4177.219999999999s)]
*  But then also by not doing that, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4180.179999999999s)]
*  it is hard, you have to meet people in real time, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4181.98s)]
*  in real life, you know? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4184.78s)]
*  And so it is more of a challenge, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4186.099999999999s)]
*  but it's also, you know, it is, I guess, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4187.46s)]
*  you just feel like you're not getting rejected. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4191.42s)]
*  When I started podcasting and online stores, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4194.66s)]
*  the furthest thing from my mind, the last thing, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4197.46s)]
*  I was thinking about other stuff, hot air balloons [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4199.86s)]
*  and making love and different stuff like that, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4201.74s)]
*  and mostly women and other stuff, that's good, desserts. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4203.78s)]
*  Now we have an online store [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4208.5s)]

*  these young men by themselves? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4372.700000000001s)]
*  Like what would you say to a young couple [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4374.1s)]
*  that's starting out, if the male is listening or the female, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4376.62s)]
*  to help give them the best chance to stay together, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4380.9800000000005s)]
*  which it seemed like would help affect other [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4382.9800000000005s)]
*  positive things along the way? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4386.06s)]
*  So again, we have a tendency in our society [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4388.1s)]
*  to assume that all divorce is the man's fault, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4390.5s)]
*  that the man is either a predator or not a good person [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4392.620000000001s)]
*  and the woman has no agency and she's the victim. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4395.54s)]
*  And the reality is 70% of divorce filings [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4399.02s)]
*  are filed by women. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4401.1s)]
*  And the majority of those divorce filings, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4402.58s)]
*  if you look at why the woman is filed for divorce, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4404.3s)]
*  it's not infidelity, it's not a lack of shared values, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4407.38s)]
*  it's the man has something happens [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4410.06s)]
*  that makes him less economically viable. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4411.660000000001s)]
*  A mental breakdown, a loss of a business, a bankruptcy. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4414.06s)]
*  Women still look at men primarily as being providers. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4417.54s)]
*  And once a man, a man going through divorce, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4422.18s)]
*  so young men are four times as likely to kill themselves, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4424.82s)]
*  a man two years after divorce is eight times as likely. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4427.5s)]
*  He no longer serves a role in his church, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4430.58s)]
*  he no longer serves a role in his primary relationship, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4432.54s)]
*  he might lose his kids. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4435.82s)]
*  One out of three men have no contact with their children [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4437.46s)]
*  after six years. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4439.7s)]
*  So he has literally no role. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4441.38s)]
*  After six years of a divorce, you mean? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4443.1s)]
*  After six years of divorce, one out of three men [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4444.34s)]
*  has absolutely no contact with their children. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4446.54s)]
*  No way. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4447.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh man, that's heartbreaking. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4448.78s)]
*  Well, it's hardly not around a lot. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4450.3s)]
*  So what I would suggest is that, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4451.86s)]
*  one, I think we need to level up young people economically. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4455.74s)]
*  And I don't think you can just target men [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4459.18s)]
*  for economic programs, I think it's too political, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4460.5s)]
*  but I think we need to restore the child tax credit, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4463.42s)]
*  I think we need a massive program to build more housing, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4465.62s)]
*  I think we should have national nuclear energy projects [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4468.82s)]
*  similar to what Truman did in the 50s [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4471.900000000001s)]
*  with the National Highway Act, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4473.900000000001s)]
*  that'll create hundreds of thousands of good, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4476.46s)]
*  millions of good paying jobs for young men. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4478.58s)]
*  So what do you mean talking about, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4480.5s)]
*  like Space Mountain going everywhere, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4481.339999999999s)]
*  like what do you mean? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4484.58s)]
*  You mean like a train system? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4485.419999999999s)]
*  No, so if you look at what's happening in our economy [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4487.78s)]
*  with AI and some of the innovations around digital, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4490.78s)]
*  the choke point or the friction is energy. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4493.9s)]
*  We're not gonna have enough energy. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4496.299999999999s)]
*  We're not gonna. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4497.62s)]
*  So nuclear energy is, in my opinion, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4498.46s)]
*  the cleanest form of energy, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4502.179999999999s)]
*  and we're gonna need a massive number [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4503.54s)]
*  of nuclear power plants built, those are good jobs. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4505.18s)]

*  70% of those jobs are for young men, that's a good thing. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4510.1s)]
*  In sum, let me back up, biggest innovation in history [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4512.5s)]
*  is not the microchip or the smartphone, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4515.62s)]
*  it's the American middle class. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4517.86s)]
*  And the way the American middle class happened, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4519.74s)]
*  it's an accident, it's not normal throughout history [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4521.66s)]
*  to have a middle class. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4524.14s)]
*  The way the American middle class formed in America [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4525.42s)]
*  was we had seven million men returned from World War II, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4528.34s)]
*  and they had demonstrated excellence in uniform, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4530.98s)]
*  they were in good shape, they were strong, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4533.02s)]
*  they had demonstrated real heroism. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4534.900000000001s)]
*  And then Truman put in place a variety of programs [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4537.660000000001s)]
*  that leveled them up economically, right? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4540.18s)]
*  The GI Bill, FHA, or Subsidized Home Loans, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4542.26s)]
*  National Transportation Act, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4545.740000000001s)]
*  he created millions and millions of men [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4547.14s)]
*  who were quite frankly, were really solid citizens [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4549.9400000000005s)]
*  who were attracted to women. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4552.740000000001s)]
*  There was huge household formations, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4554.26s)]
*  and it gave rise to the baby boom. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4555.860000000001s)]
*  And this created a number, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4558.22s)]
*  millions of American households that thought, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4559.780000000001s)]
*  I wanna give other people this opportunity, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4562.26s)]

*  I wanna bring non-whites into this opportunity, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4565.820000000001s)]
*  eventually I wanna bring gay people in this opportunity. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4567.7s)]
*  It created a more loving, generous, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4570.1s)]
*  what I'll call liberal society. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4572.3s)]
*  We have to feed the middle class. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4574.820000000001s)]
*  And the part that's failing the middle class right now [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4577.14s)]
*  is young men. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4579.58s)]
*  So the question is, how do we level up young men, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4580.58s)]
*  quite frankly, economically? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4582.58s)]
*  And I think it's a variety of programs, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4584.66s)]
*  national service, more job programs, more apprenticeship. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4586.34s)]
*  What does national service mean? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4589.820000000001s)]
*  To your mandatory national service, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4591.46s)]
*  you get out of high school. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4592.9s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4593.9s)]
*  You serve either in the armed services, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4594.74s)]
*  maybe you go into senior care, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4596.78s)]
*  maybe you help the, whatever it might be. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4598.42s)]
*  Right, it could be like digging dam, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4601.9400000000005s)]
*  installing stuff like that. Fighting fires, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4604.3s)]
*  whatever it might be, helping seniors. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4606.42s)]
*  Wow, cause then first of all, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4608.62s)]
*  you're gonna feel a attraction to your own country, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4609.62s)]
*  you're gonna feel like you contributed. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4612.86s)]
*  And once you feel like you contributed something, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4614.82s)]
*  it means something to you. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4616.22s)]
*  It's like whenever you used to, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4617.1s)]
*  your dad would drive you through the neighborhood, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4619.06s)]
*  or your grandfather, and he'd be like, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4620.62s)]
*  I built that house, or I painted that, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4621.46s)]
*  or I used to eat sandwiches over there or something. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4623.38s)]
*  It just makes you feel connected to an area, right? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4627.34s)]
*  But rather than you and me seeing each other, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4629.34s)]
*  you go, okay, Scott's a libtard. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4630.9s)]
*  And I go, oh, this is a Republican [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4633.22s)]
*  pretending to be an independent. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4634.62s)]
*  We just say we're Americans. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4636.26s)]
*  The greatest legislation in history, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4638.0199999999995s)]
*  or at least in America in the 50s and 60s, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4639.98s)]
*  and the reason we had such a productive Congress, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4643.0599999999995s)]
*  and they got along was cause they served [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4645.14s)]
*  in the same uniform. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4646.46s)]
*  They weren't blue or red, they were Americans, right? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4647.46s)]
*  Yeah, you go through those grave cemeteries, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4649.74s)]
*  you go through them, and it's different ethnicities, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4651.74s)]
*  different religions, different. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4653.7s)]
*  There's no red or blue. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4654.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4655.9s)]
*  It doesn't say Democrat or Republican. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4656.74s)]
*  So a massive leveling up economically of young people. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4659.099999999999s)]
*  I'd like to do what Portugal did. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4663.42s)]
*  Portugal has said, we're turning into this retirement place [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4664.82s)]
*  for hedge fund managers, and the brightest young people [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4668.26s)]
*  in Portugal have one thing in common, they leave. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4670.7s)]
*  So you know what they've done, Theo? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4673.099999999999s)]
*  They've decided no taxes age 20 to 30. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4674.0599999999995s)]
*  And it actually doesn't cost them that much [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4677.26s)]
*  because most people age 20 to 30. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4678.9s)]
*  Aren't making much money. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4680.58s)]
*  Don't make much money. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4681.42s)]
*  Right, it's beyond that, you make your money. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4682.259999999999s)]
*  We need, 40% of our budget goes to seniors, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4683.86s)]
*  which leaves less money for education, programs, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4687.86s)]
*  investment in R&D, which are more productive investments. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4690.339999999999s)]
*  We have a political system where old people keep voting [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4693.219999999999s)]
*  and more old people who vote themselves more money, right? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4695.82s)]
*  The $120 billion cost of living adjustment increase [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4699.78s)]
*  for social security flies right through. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4702.86s)]
*  The $40 billion tax credit to help young families, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4704.46s)]
*  that gets stripped out of the Inflation Reduction Act. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4707.42s)]
*  We need to massively economically lift up young people, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4710.06s)]
*  which will disproportionately benefit young men [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4713.86s)]
*  who have fallen further faster, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4716.66s)]
*  and quite frankly make them more attractive. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4717.86s)]
*  And people are gonna start having kids again. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4720.26s)]
*  40 years ago, 60% of 30 year olds had a kid, now it's 27%. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4721.900000000001s)]

*  40 years ago was 36. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4729.66s)]
*  Are people not buying homes and not having kids [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4731.58s)]
*  because they don't want them? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4733.26s)]
*  No, they can't afford them. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4734.34s)]
*  And guess what? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4735.22s)]
*  When a guy shows up and says, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4736.14s)]

*  The woman doesn't want to pair with this guy. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4744.22s)]
*  We need a massive lift up of young people. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4747.18s)]
*  And everything we do is nothing [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4750.06s)]
*  but a thinly veiled transfer of wealth [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4752.700000000001s)]
*  from your generation to mine. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4755.700000000001s)]

*  It went into the stock market. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4765.58s)]

*  We need economic responsibility [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4799.58s)]
*  and we need to transfer wealth back from the incumbents [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4801.26s)]
*  to the entrance and level up young people [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4804.18s)]
*  which will disproportionately benefit the group [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4806.86s)]
*  that has fallen furthest fastest and is young men. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4809.62s)]
*  We need to make young men more economically viable again [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4812.14s)]
*  such that they can form households. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4815.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4817.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, yeah, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4818.22s)]
*  almost if you're a young man these days, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4819.9800000000005s)]
*  you just wanna just hide sometimes I think. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4821.82s)]
*  You know, and it's not even their own fault. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4825.34s)]
*  That's one thing I wanna say like some of it is [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4826.86s)]
*  the society that we're in [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4829.179999999999s)]
*  isn't really doing its best to support you. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4830.38s)]
*  Is that okay to say that? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4832.82s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4834.46s)]
*  One of three. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4835.7s)]
*  Yeah, I just want, I don't want young men to hear this [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4836.54s)]
*  and feel like I'm a loser. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4838.38s)]
*  Young men have it, I mean, on one level [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4842.0199999999995s)]
*  people have more agency in our nation [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4845.259999999999s)]
*  than they've had in a long time. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4847.42s)]
*  Young men, there's definitely in our society [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4849.1s)]
*  a bias against them. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4852.54s)]
*  If you go to the Democratic National Committee's website, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4853.42s)]
*  there's a section that says who we serve. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4857.46s)]
*  They actually spell out, we're the Democratic Party, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4859.5s)]
*  this is who we serve and it lists 16 demographic groups [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4863.1s)]
*  from Asians and Pacific Islanders to black Americans, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4865.9800000000005s)]
*  veterans, the disabled, immigrants. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4868.46s)]
*  I added it up, it's 76% of the population. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4871.26s)]
*  So when you're purposefully advantaging [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4874.740000000001s)]
*  76% of the population, you're not advantaging them. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4876.62s)]
*  You're discriminating against the 24%. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4880.54s)]
*  And who are the 24% that aren't mentioned? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4882.74s)]
*  Young men. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4885.42s)]
*  The Democratic National Convention was a parade [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4886.86s)]
*  of every special interest group, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4889.26s)]
*  but they never once mentioned the group [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4891.0199999999995s)]
*  that has fallen furthest, fastest, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4893.34s)]
*  and quite frankly, in my view, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4894.98s)]
*  needs the most help right now, and that is young men. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4896.14s)]
*  So we need a more productive conversation [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4899.18s)]
*  that looks at the stats. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4901.1s)]
*  Four times as likely to kill themselves, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4902.54s)]
*  three times as likely to be addicted, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4904.22s)]
*  12 times as likely to be incarcerated. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4905.74s)]
*  If that was happening to any other special interest group, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4907.94s)]
*  it would be through the roof insane. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4910.82s)]
*  We'd be weighing in with programs, with empathy, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4912.139999999999s)]
*  and here's the thing, empathy is not a zero sum game. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4915.42s)]
*  Gay marriage didn't hurt. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4918.38s)]
*  What does zero sum game mean? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4919.54s)]
*  Well, there's a feel. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4920.9s)]
*  When I talk about young men, people go to, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4922.46s)]
*  well, that's gonna hurt women. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4926.22s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4927.62s)]
*  You know who wants more economically [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4928.46s)]
*  and emotionally viable men? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4929.74s)]
*  Women. Women. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4931.099999999999s)]
*  Yup. Women. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4932.139999999999s)]
*  God. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4933.42s)]
*  Civil rights didn't hurt white people. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4934.78s)]
*  No. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4937.0199999999995s)]
*  Gay marriage, in my opinion, didn't hurt heteronormative men. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4937.86s)]
*  It didn't get in the way of me marrying a woman, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4939.94s)]
*  and having empathy for men isn't gonna hurt women. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4942.34s)]
*  Women in the United States are not gonna flourish [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4947.3s)]
*  if men are flailing, and they are, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4950.34s)]
*  and because it's men and because of the privilege [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4953.3s)]
*  I recognized, there's a lack of empathy for them, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4955.5s)]
*  and quite frankly, because some, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4958.3s)]
*  I would argue fairly unproductive voices [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4960.5s)]
*  entered that void about five, 10 years ago. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4963.06s)]
*  A lot of people had sort of a gag reflex [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4966.02s)]
*  when you started talking about men, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4968.34s)]
*  and you know who's leading the charge [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4969.660000000001s)]
*  around this topic right now, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4971.14s)]
*  who I get the most emails from? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4972.22s)]
*  Mothers. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4974.14s)]
*  And it goes something like this. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4976.54s)]
*  I have three kids, two daughters, one son. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4977.700000000001s)]
*  One daughter is in Chicago in PR, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4979.580000000001s)]
*  the other's in graduate school at Penn, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4981.740000000001s)]
*  and my son is in the basement [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4983.740000000001s)]
*  vaping and playing video games. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4985.34s)]
*  And if you look at the election, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4987.740000000001s)]
*  the two groups that swung most viciously [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4989.5s)]
*  away from blue towards Trump were two groups. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4992.66s)]
*  People under the age of 30, young people aren't doing well. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4996.54s)]
*  And the second group and the most surprising, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=4999.78s)]
*  45 to 64 year old women, or put another way, mothers. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5002.46s)]
*  So this was, in my opinion, the kids are not all right, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5007.86s)]
*  or kind of the testosterone election, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5012.42s)]
*  and that is if your kids aren't doing well, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5014.9s)]
*  you wanna blow everything up. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5017.26s)]
*  You don't just want change, you want chaos. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5020.1s)]
*  And one guy was the chaos candidate. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5023.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5026.22s)]
*  Well, I think also though, one great thing that Trump did [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5027.14s)]
*  was when he brought RFK Jr. in, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5031.06s)]
*  because RFK Jr. was also a very, was a rogue. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5033.02s)]
*  Remember when people were like, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5036.62s)]
*  this guy is like a crazy guy or whatever? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5037.46s)]
*  Like he's eating, you know, he's, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5040.26s)]
*  you know, he didn't believe in, you know, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5043.02s)]
*  he just got so labeled by the media. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5044.5s)]
*  And so I think bringing him in was a great point. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5046.66s)]
*  A great idea. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5048.98s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you that he's crazy. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5049.82s)]
*  Yeah, you do? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5051.94s)]
*  He's bat shit crazy. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5053.46s)]
*  Oh, he's a great guy, man. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5054.5s)]
*  Oh dude. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5055.86s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5056.7s)]
*  Give me, I don't know if you're holding vaccines, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5057.54s)]
*  but let's shoot up. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5059.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5060.3s)]
*  There's nothing I love more than being high [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5061.14s)]
*  than not being sick. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5062.26s)]
*  Vaccines are the best thing to happen in modern society. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5063.18s)]
*  I don't disagree that they are. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5065.86s)]
*  I just think that they just need to make sure [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5066.94s)]
*  that they are. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5069.0599999999995s)]
*  He's great on the environment. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5070.38s)]
*  I'll give you that. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5071.46s)]
*  I think he's great on the environment. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5072.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5073.38s)]
*  We don't have to agree on it. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5074.22s)]
*  So I know you're a professor here at NYU. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5077.18s)]
*  And why do you talk about, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5080.74s)]
*  I've heard you talk about advising your students [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5082.38s)]
*  not to follow their passion, but to follow their talent. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5084.62s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5088.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5089.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5090.3s)]
*  I think anyone who tells you to follow your passion [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5091.12s)]
*  is already rich. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5092.0599999999995s)]
*  I think this is your job. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5093.66s)]
*  I think your job is to find what you're really good at. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5094.98s)]
*  Because I think a lot of times young men [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5098.22s)]

*  If you're a parent and your kid is on social media, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5392.8s)]
*  you don't have any choice. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5396.92s)]
*  The kid doesn't have any choice. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5398.04s)]
*  He's gonna be on a platform. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5399.160000000001s)]
*  And these companies are so powerful [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5401.4800000000005s)]
*  that they're able to, and they make so much money, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5402.92s)]
*  that they're able to kind of weaponize government. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5404.64s)]
*  We've had 40 congressional hearings [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5406.8s)]
*  talking about child safety. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5408.96s)]
*  We've had zero laws passed. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5410.64s)]
*  And I think competition as a whole [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5413.0s)]
*  is a great way of bringing down costs. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5414.64s)]
*  I think the best way to handle inflation is competition. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5416.200000000001s)]
*  And you have one company with 93% share of search, Google, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5419.6s)]
*  66% share of social, Meta, 50% share of e-commerce. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5423.68s)]
*  Two companies control 93% of AI, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5428.88s)]
*  AI LLMs and the GPUs. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5434.52s)]
*  That's OpenAI and Nvidia. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5436.96s)]
*  So there's already monopolies forming in AI. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5438.6s)]
*  And I- It's unbelievable. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5441.68s)]
*  Here's Australia wants to ban kids. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5442.96s)]
*  I saw this other day on 16th from social media. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5444.4800000000005s)]
*  As world government see to crack down on the addictive apps, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5446.04s)]
*  I think that that's a great idea. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5448.72s)]
*  I don't think that kids, so, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5450.72s)]
*  and also especially if kids aren't gonna be protected. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5452.360000000001s)]
*  Like, did you see that moment where they had Zuckerberg [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5454.72s)]
*  with all the parents of children who were killed [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5457.16s)]
*  by adults on Facebook [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5459.240000000001s)]
*  and they were allowed to contact them? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5461.92s)]
*  Like, why should an adult be allowed to contact a child? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5463.88s)]
*  You should easily, if you have all the data, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5467.0s)]
*  you should easily know this is a child and this is an adult. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5469.320000000001s)]
*  There's no reason for them to contact each other [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5471.88s)]
*  without going through the parent. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5474.76s)]
*  There's no reason anyone under the age of 14 [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5475.84s)]
*  should have a smartphone. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5477.88s)]
*  I mean, I've said this. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5479.4800000000005s)]
*  I think Cinder Pichai and Tim Cook [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5480.52s)]
*  are basically crack dealers outside of junior high school. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5482.96s)]
*  No one under the age of 14 should be on a smartphone. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5485.92s)]
*  Could you have at 14 handled a casino, a bedding, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5488.56s)]
*  you know, an IMAX theater, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5492.92s)]
*  a porn site in your pocket all day long? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5495.84s)]
*  I could handle it at 34, 37. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5499.4800000000005s)]
*  Right? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5501.08s)]
*  So, and then no, I don't think anyone should be [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5502.04s)]
*  on a social media app under the age of 16. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5504.24s)]
*  And parents are stepping in. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5506.48s)]
*  And a lot of this, again, is because of the inspiration [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5508.16s)]
*  of my colleague, Jonathan Haidt, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5510.44s)]
*  but entire countries are banning phones and social media. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5512.16s)]
*  There's just, there's so much evidence around the mental. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5515.639999999999s)]
*  Think about what a place of perversion, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5518.799999999999s)]
*  Instagram, begins with. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5521.2s)]
*  It encourages 15-year-old girls to pose provocatively [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5523.599999999999s)]
*  and sexualize themselves such that their peers [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5527.959999999999s)]
*  and strange men around the world [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5530.679999999999s)]
*  can evaluate and contact them. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5532.4s)]
*  Imagine, imagine there was a park [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5535.64s)]
*  and there were 15-year-old girls and they said to the park, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5538.64s)]
*  we'd really like it if you showed up in halftube tops [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5541.280000000001s)]
*  and miniskirts and then your peers get to sit around you [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5544.6s)]
*  and comment out loud and strange men from anywhere [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5549.240000000001s)]
*  can come and comment and then contact you. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5552.64s)]
*  Would we allow that? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5556.96s)]
*  Not a chance. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5558.320000000001s)]
*  That's Instagram. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5559.160000000001s)]
*  Why do we allow that then? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5560.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, do we expect our government to save us or who's, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5561.72s)]
*  or do we have to save ourselves? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5564.8s)]
*  Well, I think at the end of the day, I think it's our fault. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5567.08s)]
*  We haven't voted in the people who understand [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5570.08s)]
*  these technologies are willing to stand up [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5571.6s)]
*  to these companies. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5573.04s)]
*  They're very savvy. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5573.88s)]
*  They spend a lot of money on lobbying. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5575.12s)]
*  And I also think in the back room, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5577.12s)]
*  they're probably doing deals around national security [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5578.400000000001s)]
*  to help us kind of hunt down the bad guys. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5580.56s)]
*  I think it's a nuanced argument, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5583.16s)]
*  but at the end of the day, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5585.08s)]
*  our government has really let us down. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5585.96s)]
*  When we look back, Theo, on this era around big tech, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5587.24s)]
*  I think we're gonna regret the concentration of power, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5590.68s)]
*  the monopoly power, the weaponization [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5593.4s)]
*  of some of our elections, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5595.599999999999s)]
*  some of the misinformation that's come out. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5596.5199999999995s)]
*  But more than anything, we'll look back on this era [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5598.839999999999s)]
*  and think, how did we let this happen to our kids? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5601.679999999999s)]
*  We don't have kids. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5603.839999999999s)]
*  I should know better. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5605.48s)]
*  My son developed device addiction. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5607.0s)]
*  My kid hides in the bathroom so he can be on TikTok. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5610.32s)]
*  I don't know what he's on on TikTok. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5613.0s)]
*  There's been some instances of bullying, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5615.16s)]
*  both him being bullied and bullying others. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5617.0s)]
*  And I think we're probably not as bad as some households. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5619.839999999999s)]
*  This is literally, there is no addiction in America. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5622.92s)]
*  24%, two thirds of teens are on social media. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5626.4s)]
*  24% qualify as addicts. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5630.4s)]
*  Can you imagine any, we age gate pornography, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5633.0s)]
*  the military, motorcycles, weapons, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5636.0s)]
*  but we don't age gate social media. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5638.6s)]
*  And 20, what other substance, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5641.16s)]
*  what other company could get away [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5643.08s)]
*  with getting two thirds of kids on that substance [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5645.36s)]
*  and then having a quarter of them be identified [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5648.36s)]
*  clinically as addicts? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5650.72s)]
*  We wouldn't and haven't put up with it anywhere else. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5653.52s)]
*  But these guys are so smart, have so many lobbyists. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5656.92s)]
*  There are more full-time lobbyists. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5659.4800000000005s)]
*  And there are representatives and senators. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5661.320000000001s)]
*  Just at Amazon. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5664.240000000001s)]
*  Amazon has more full-time paid lobbyists living in DC [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5665.8s)]
*  than there are sitting US senators. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5670.0s)]
*  We've been overrun. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5671.360000000001s)]
*  Our government's been overrun by money. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5672.8s)]
*  And we haven't been able to vote in people [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5674.72s)]
*  that are able to stand up and pass laws. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5676.96s)]
*  This shit is difficult and complicated. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5679.4400000000005s)]
*  And these companies have taken advantage of it. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5682.2s)]
*  Also, they have the propaganda to turn up the dials. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5683.72s)]
*  Because they own the information that's going out. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5687.68s)]
*  They can manage it. 100%. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5690.32s)]
*  God, God, I don't even know if I can fucking [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5693.96s)]
*  get out of this room today. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5697.08s)]
*  Let's go to Whole Foods. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5698.28s)]
*  Right before you leave, you said one of the biggest choices [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5701.64s)]
*  is the person that you will marry. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5703.72s)]
*  I've heard you say that. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5705.32s)]
*  Have kids with. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5706.28s)]
*  Have kids with. 100%. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5707.16s)]
*  And that goes back to a willingness to endure rejection [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5708.88s)]
*  such that you can find someone who's really high character [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5711.2s)]
*  that you're attracted to. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5714.24s)]

*  are really successful. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5720.2s)]
*  Smart, talented, ballers professionally, a lot of money. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5722.04s)]
*  But they don't really have a partner. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5725.88s)]
*  And I find that their life has an unnecessary amount [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5728.12s)]
*  of stress and disappointment in it. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5730.639999999999s)]
*  And at the same time, I have a lot of other friends [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5732.08s)]
*  who are not as economically successful, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5734.599999999999s)]
*  but they have a real partner. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5738.36s)]
*  And everything burns a little bit brighter. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5739.68s)]
*  And I hope, oh, I hope I'm around, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5742.200000000001s)]
*  but I hope we have the chance in 10 or 20 years, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5745.04s)]
*  I'm confident you're going to find someone to have kids. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5746.96s)]
*  All of this, right? [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5750.08s)]
*  Podcast, AI, social media, GDP growth, Trump. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5751.200000000001s)]
*  It's all bullshit. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5756.6s)]
*  It's all a means. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5758.200000000001s)]
*  The ends, the whole shooting match [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5759.72s)]
*  is finding someone you care about and having kids. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5761.84s)]
*  That's what I found. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5766.08s)]
*  I didn't want to have kids. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5766.92s)]
*  I didn't want to get married. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5768.16s)]
*  So that actually disproved [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5769.64s)]
*  what your original thoughts and feelings were. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5770.88s)]
*  I got it wrong. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5772.4s)]
*  And you can't, no one who doesn't have kids [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5773.5599999999995s)]
*  can fully understand it. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5776.36s)]
*  And by the way, I want to be clear. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5777.24s)]
*  There are other ways to find and receive love. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5778.36s)]
*  I don't think you have to have kids to be happy. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5780.2s)]
*  What I can tell you is that the majority of people I know [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5781.76s)]
*  who've had kids who've said, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5784.04s)]
*  it's a tremendous amount of stress, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5785.5599999999995s)]
*  but it's the first time in my life [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5787.44s)]
*  I felt like I had real purpose and real meaning. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5788.72s)]
*  And that's what our economy is supposed to do. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5791.76s)]
*  It's supposed to give young people, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5793.599999999999s)]
*  specifically more young men right now, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5794.88s)]
*  the opportunity to engage in loving, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5796.52s)]
*  supportive relationships and have kids. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5798.96s)]
*  That's the whole shooting match. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5801.320000000001s)]
*  Everything else is the means. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5802.92s)]
*  That's the ends. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5805.040000000001s)]
*  The G-PROF podcast at your... [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5809.080000000001s)]

*  Thanks for coming and just thinking with us, man. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5827.04s)]
*  And yeah, we don't wanna look down on young men. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5829.44s)]
*  We don't wanna do that. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5831.36s)]
*  We're just looking at stuff [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5832.28s)]
*  because part of it is to let young men know [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5833.5199999999995s)]
*  and men know that some of the system that we're in [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5836.08s)]
*  and the environment that we're in is not set up to help us. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5839.44s)]
*  So don't feel ashamed of yourself. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5842.0s)]
*  That's something I don't wanna push that at all. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5845.599999999999s)]
*  At 24, I was living with my mother. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5849.2s)]
*  No economic prospects, no romantic prospects. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5852.08s)]
*  I was broke at 34, then I was broke again at 42. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5856.24s)]
*  And the first thing, the first emotion I felt [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5859.28s)]
*  when my oldest son had the poor judgment [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5861.679999999999s)]
*  to come marching out of my girlfriend, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5864.12s)]
*  it was 2008, great financial recession. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5866.36s)]
*  I'd lost everything was I felt shame and humiliation. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5868.96s)]
*  Forgive yourself. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5873.32s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5892.120000000001s)]
*  And work your ass off and try and show, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=882GY0ozn9k&t=5892.96s)]
