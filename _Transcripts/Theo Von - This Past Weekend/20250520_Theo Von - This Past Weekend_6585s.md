*  That's funny [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=245.04s)]
*  Do you feel like it was probably when you look at the at the players today? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  It was do you feel like it was easier for them to be able to uh, pick up stats? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean the game has changed the game has evolved a lot [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=254.0s)]
*  Obviously from a receiver standpoint they they throw the ball much more much more the era [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=257.48s)]
*  I played in it was it was more about running the ball to open up the pass [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=261.4s)]
*  So they definitely I mean it's different average they have added game too [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=265.04s)]
*  so it was a much more difficult in the game is a little more lenient in favor of the offensive side because [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=268.64s)]
*  Defensive defenders really can't do anything. You can't hit you can't it's they throw flags for everything. You get fine for everything [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  I think you know my era and the era before me football in general back then was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=279.8s)]
*  The true definition of football. I mean, it's a gladiator sport. Yeah [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. What why do you think they softened up the rules like that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=289.56s)]
*  Why do you think they made it like that? Honestly the truth? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  Um, I forgot what era it was when they sued the nfl for um, all the injuries. Um [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=294.76s)]
*  All the trauma that players have suffered in the past. Yeah, and they won the lawsuit [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=301.64s)]
*  It might have been a billion or something like that and they had no choice but to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=305.88000000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=310.68s)]
*  The national football league was sued for failing to protect players from head injuries which can lead to cte starting in 2011 [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=311.0s)]
*  In 2012 a class action lawsuit was filed. Yeah consolidate number 4,500 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  former player cases [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=322.12s)]
*  So they settled that huh? Yeah, they won [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  Damn those players won and that's why the rules are what they are today [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  I know they always preach about player safety, but that's I mean player safety is is cool. It's understandable [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=329.32000000000005s)]
*  But the players have gotten faster stronger bigger the dimensions of the field haven't changed at all [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=334.12s)]
*  So therefore injuries are still going to happen [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=339.23999999999995s)]
*  Concussions are still going to happen. There's no way to prevent that. Yeah, it's impossible [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=342.26s)]
*  Yeah, what? Yeah, because that's part of it. You can't just stop that. It is part of you know [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=346.52s)]
*  What you signed up for? Yeah, you know what you signed up when when you when you make it, you know [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=349.64s)]
*  As a one percent in nfl [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=353.64s)]
*  It's a gladiator sport. It's barbaric [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  It kind of is a little bit of a bummer because you don't really get [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=358.28s)]
*  As meant there's not a lot enough [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=362.2s)]
*  Defensive cornerbacks and safeties [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=365.96s)]
*  They don't really get enough love then because you don't even get to know them as much because they can't play as much defense [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=367.88s)]
*  Does that make sense? Uh a little bit but but some of them some of them have made a name for themselves [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=372.44s)]

*  It just seems uh [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=499.08s)]
*  I don't know you would almost rather [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=501.32s)]
*  Don't do this play or somebody get hit. Well, not not really it just slide early [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=503.96s)]
*  You know the guys are coming they're much faster than you especially quarterbacks [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  They're much faster than you and mahomes is one who's really tricky is he'll purposely slide late to get a penalty [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't know he does it on purpose sometimes they'll pretend like he's going down [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=518.04s)]
*  Or going to step out of bounds and stay in just a little bit just a tad second longer [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just left flag thrown so god he's lingering the offensive players are using the rules to their advantage [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=525.0s)]
*  And it puts it puts the defensive players in a pickle. Yeah [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  But it builds it up for people want stats people want to see the scoring. Yeah [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=534.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=538.04s)]
*  So I guess it's just a sign of the times [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=538.76s)]
*  Do you think it can ever swing back the other way or do you think that the legal issues and stuff are going to keep it? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  Out of that it will never swing back the other way because the nfl they have to protect themselves [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=545.0s)]
*  They got to protect the shield and protect the players, you know on the back end [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=548.76s)]
*  Was it tough on your team when you play with the bangles like I know you play with a couple of different teams [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=552.6s)]
*  But was it or with any team is it fun for a receiver if they're running bro? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  Is it even fun? Yeah, like you have to pretend that they're gonna pass [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=560.36s)]
*  No [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=564.12s)]
*  Because I would I like to call myself an all-around player outside of just catching the balls because there were certain things [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  I already knew I would have two people on me every time so that opened up the running game [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  So I had no problem [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=574.04s)]
*  If you open up the running game and the running game is doing well [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=574.84s)]
*  Then they have to take a safety and get him up off of me and bring him down in the box [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=577.8s)]
*  Now I get to now I get to cook [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=581.56s)]
*  So I look I look I look at it that way [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=583.72s)]
*  Do you think a lot of players look at it that way like probably not? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=586.12s)]
*  I knew I knew I would get mine no matter what because I was the number one I was the number one receiver [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  So at some point the ball was going to get to me [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=592.92s)]
*  But then you have some games you go into and a team will say you know what today 85 is not beating us [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=595.08s)]
*  You're gonna have to be somebody else in those games, you know, you do the best you can to keep your composure [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=601.64s)]
*  It gets frustrating at times you do out there just getting cardio in. Yeah, but you're gonna have games like that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  So if somebody if they're if you know your team is running, right? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=611.56s)]
*  But you still have to pretend like they're gonna pass right because yeah, yeah always always and I i'm rarely rarely [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=614.12s)]
*  Ever was lackadaisical because I understood what I mean to us offensively even when I wouldn't get the ball [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=620.68s)]
*  Right, like even if you're saying if they think they're gonna have to keep an eye and if his eyes over here [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=626.12s)]
*  It's not over here in the box. Yeah, most definitely most definitely so I run them off [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=630.28s)]
*  Um, and was that still fun too even on those plays is still fun. I made it fun [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=635.16s)]
*  I had to because I used that time to talk shit. Yeah, can you curse? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=639.0s)]
*  Huh? Okay. I'm sorry. Okay, cool. You can talk shit dude [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=642.8399999999999s)]

*  You know, they put some other shit in it at the house or whatever [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=885.64s)]

*  That you stay away from you have the discipline to do it most people say oh you're so disciplined [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=937.3199999999999s)]

*  Family members never call especially like that back to back from different family members [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=963.8s)]
*  And I kind of already knew what it was [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=968.92s)]
*  Because my brother had already called so I already know nothing's wrong with him, right? And I I had a feeling what it was and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=971.16s)]

*  I didn't know which mom was going to show up and I didn't want her to to embarrass me in those moments [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=1309.42s)]
*  Moments that would be we're supposed to be celebrating whatever achieving it may be [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=1314.94s)]

*  But it's just me kind of from the outside perspective is even if things are chaotic and crazy for other people [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=1348.78s)]
*  You're still able to have this sense of humor that things aren't even not that it doesn't matter [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=1353.26s)]

*  Yes, think about during my time playing. Yeah, I was very chaotic [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=1384.0600000000002s)]
*  I purposely tried to piss the nfl off purposely because I understood the game is an entertainment sport [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=1388.38s)]
*  So therefore i'm going to bring just that the entertainment value part to it [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=1395.0200000000002s)]

*  Yeah, but I think we just get caught up in the moment most of the time and I think our counterparts on the other hand [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2501.02s)]
*  um [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2506.38s)]
*  They have a little bit more a little bit more discipline in that area [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2509.1s)]
*  But I think they they they're not as bad as us but also they're what do you mean our counterparts? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2512.86s)]
*  I mean white white guys. Okay, so white guys versus black guys [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2517.5s)]
*  I'm not even looking at it like in a yes. I am looking at obviously in culture, right? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2520.78s)]
*  I'm not really looking at it in race, but I'm looking at it in culture, right? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2525.02s)]
*  So i'm thinking in black culture. Is it more of a thing to have it happens? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2527.7400000000002s)]
*  It happens a lot because we get caught up in the moment. Okay, we get caught up in a moment now [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2531.26s)]
*  I'm one who's one of those but y'all like to fight the ball. Yeah, but for me [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2535.34s)]
*  Everything i've done was strategic and not done on purpose. There was a method to my madness [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2540.0600000000004s)]
*  It was a method nobody's i'm not having kids. Nobody's running to child support and oh chet [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2544.0600000000004s)]
*  No, no because we all had one end goal. You understood what it was [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2548.94s)]
*  And I also had kids with people that i've known before I even made it [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2552.78s)]
*  So there were no ulterior motives like most have when you meet them once you've already had money [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2556.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, you need some thought of the equinox or something and you have a child and the first thing you wonder [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2560.6200000000003s)]
*  Why things don't work out? Yeah, not things most time don't work [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2565.34s)]
*  But no, it's like yeah, you don't know who you're you don't you're putting yourself at risk [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2568.38s)]
*  Yeah, so you're saying instead of risk straight you have more strategy. Yeah. Yeah, most definitely most definitely most definitely [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2572.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because I just wonder sometimes I wonder in black culture. Do they view do black men view the world differently? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2577.58s)]
*  Like is there a do they view it more as like a i'm a king and this is my castle. No, I don't [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2584.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't you know, that's just how I wonder sometimes or like [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2590.86s)]
*  Yeah, like is there a strategy sometimes? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2594.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, I gave you mine right and i've always lived by that no matter who it was [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2596.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't care how fine you are. I'm not here to raise models. I want athletes [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2600.14s)]
*  So therefore i'm going to procreate with those who give me just that [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2603.9s)]
*  Now you listen you'll have yeah have fun and go on dates and yeah for those who who are [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2607.8199999999997s)]
*  Not that but when it comes to having kids. Oh, oh honey. Uh-uh [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2614.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, how fine you are? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2619.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you got a kid your kid walking at three weeks [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2621.2599999999998s)]
*  Running yeah [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2625.58s)]
*  Yeah, but for his first birthday you get him a hurdle [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2627.66s)]
*  Um, do you think what else am I thinking about? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2632.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you think uh [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2638.46s)]
*  Do you think there's a lot of gay they just had a guy they were talking about a gay gentleman in an nfl [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2641.58s)]
*  Do you think there's more gay men in the nfl that we just don't know about absolutely and they're afraid to say [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2645.74s)]
*  They probably don't want to it make it make people uncomfortable and immediately make it a big deal [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2652.14s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I'm sure it is. I'm sure it is and listen I wouldn't I wouldn't have a problem with it [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2657.1s)]
*  You know, because i'd be the one making jokes. Oh, yeah [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2662.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'd listen i'd be the one making jokes. I don't care what you are gay trans abc. I don't care [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2665.1s)]
*  I'm accepting of all yeah, and I would I would have but yeah, I'm still gonna cut up on them. Oh, yeah [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2670.7799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely and it's probably for the best because if you get some good jokes going [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2676.36s)]
*  That's the thing about joking all the time [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2680.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like they tried to make joking a crime over the past like 10 years. Everything is everybody's very sensitive [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2681.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's one reason I like ab is because he just [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2687.18s)]
*  You know in his heart [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2691.5s)]
*  That he probably don't have a lot of malice in that world, right? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2693.2599999999998s)]
*  But he likes to have fun, you know [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2697.1s)]
*  That's one thing I think that black culture does better than white culture does is tell jokes [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2698.7799999999997s)]
*  If you get around and you start clouting on somebody, but you're right there with them. They know you were supported [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2703.5s)]
*  Yeah, but man that's and then you know, the next bullet is coming right the next time they get a chance [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2709.2599999999998s)]
*  It's coming for you. Yeah, most definitely that's the most fun, dude [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2715.1s)]

*  Call it homophobic, you know, I think and um, I think that's one of the reasons a lot of players don't want to come out [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2721.5s)]
*  You know or people in general that might swing the other way. I mean shoot. Fuck it [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2727.18s)]

*  Yeah, it's funny it's funny especially where we are in the world right now [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2782.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2785.8199999999997s)]
*  That's some people based on occupation and based on what you do [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2786.06s)]
*  You really can't come out because it can jeopardize what you have going on [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2789.58s)]
*  But it feels like the only place that is kind of well, maybe this i'm sure there's probably like some like [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2792.86s)]
*  probably farming communities like [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2797.66s)]
*  uh [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2799.98s)]
*  You know, I bet there's probably farming communities and maybe the end and maybe athletics, but I don't know in women's athletics [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2801.9s)]
*  It's accepted. Oh, it's accepted. Yeah, it's probably just in men's athletics [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2807.66s)]
*  Do you think that there's a if you took the gay players from all the team you think you could make a you think you could [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2810.7s)]
*  Make a gay team in the nfl. No, probably not. So you don't think there's enough gay men to make a team [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2816.46s)]
*  No, no, not that many which division you think in the nfl probably have the most gay players [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2820.94s)]
*  I have no idea. That's a good that's a good one. I have no idea because I don't know [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2825.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know everybody's preference, right? But if you had to guess even just by looking at some let's pull up the just pull up the uh, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2828.86s)]
*  That's the funny thing about you can't look at somebody until no you can't but i'm just saying look at some of these records though [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2835.5800000000004s)]
*  the cowboy [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2840.78s)]

*  Oh, okay [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2845.82s)]
*  Hey, that's a that's a good one. I mean to be able to statistically rate [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2847.18s)]
*  How many people would be you you would never know right? You would never know but it's fun to guess with your friends [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2852.22s)]
*  But I will say this, uh [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2858.62s)]
*  I think it would be great if they had a gay team [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2862.06s)]
*  You think so? Yeah, because you know how many people would support them. Yeah people want oh they it would be huge people always want the underdog [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2865.58s)]
*  Right. Yeah, they always want the underdog would they really be the underdog? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2871.98s)]
*  I that's a good point. Would they really be done the dog, right? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2875.34s)]
*  But I think they would be billed as the underdog right just in general, right in general. That's a good point [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2878.54s)]
*  Now that's a fair statement. Would they actually physically capability be the underdog? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2883.26s)]
*  No, we have no idea right because we don't know what the team is but [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2888.62s)]
*  I think they would get billed as this underdog which would give them a chip on their shoulder type of mentality [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2892.94s)]
*  Right now. I think it's one of the same reasons why you see like oh they have a a national game [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2897.9s)]
*  They got a squad already i'm telling you about we're getting close [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=2902.8599999999997s)]

*  But even then i'm not sure the jets obviously look bad last year ain't no telling [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3013.18s)]
*  Ain't no telling how they're gonna be this year now that they have a quarterback in justin fields [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3019.18s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. That's a good question. I would like to see that. I like that hypothetical. Thank you, sir [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3023.2599999999998s)]

*  um [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3044.78s)]
*  How tough is it for a player if you're going to a new team? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3046.06s)]
*  If you know that the quarterback hasn't had a ton of success, is that a tough spot to be in? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3048.78s)]
*  How do you manage your expectations? Like [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3053.42s)]
*  you know, you're going to a team where [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3056.06s)]
*  You know, maybe you leave in a team that had like a drew breeze or a tom brady, right? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3058.94s)]
*  And you know the balls are coming, right? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3062.86s)]
*  You know, they're going to be in a vicinity where you can catch them and you know [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3064.7s)]
*  There's going to be 30 passes a game and then you you get into a spot where um [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3067.8199999999997s)]
*  You're at a quarterback that's going to throw 22 passes a game and he's maybe going to get 170 yards out of 140 yards [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3073.66s)]
*  You know, it all depends on the quarterback and the offense you go to and how much they're going to use you [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3080.14s)]
*  It's all about how good you are. Obviously if you're going to another team [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3085.02s)]
*  Most of the time you're not who you thought you were [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3089.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh most of the time [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3092.2999999999997s)]
*  So you have to think about that if you weren't if you weren't regarded that much that they are keeping you [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3094.3799999999997s)]
*  You're not who you thought you were unless you're on the back end of your career [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3098.46s)]
*  Normally once a player hits year 10 they move on from regardless of who you are no matter how good you are [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3101.5s)]
*  You know jerry rice to rainy moss at some point teams moved up even moved on from them and we talk about some of the greats [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3107.1s)]
*  You know greats ever but when it happens early, you know you're in year three or year four [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3113.66s)]
*  It is time to look in the mirror and say how can I make myself more valuable [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3118.78s)]
*  If they were willing to move on from me [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3125.1s)]
*  And what are ways you think that players can do that? Like what can you do to make yourself got to work on your craft? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3127.9s)]
*  You got to you got to work on your craft how? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3132.94s)]
*  There are players coming in year in year out always but how can I continue to main make sure my value stays at a high level? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3135.58s)]
*  Yeah [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3142.78s)]
*  Where to where no matter who's coming out you won't be able to get this kind of production from anyone else [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3143.26s)]
*  And that's that's that's the fight every year. You got somebody coming behind you [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3149.82s)]

*  We all look, you know, because i'm critical of myself, right? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3374.94s)]

*  I don't know what it is sometimes but I want to do my best and sometimes I'll look at certain interviews like [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3380.62s)]
*  I interviewed mark zuckerberg a couple weeks ago from um [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3385.18s)]

*  I should have done. I knew I could have done better [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3392.22s)]
*  I think I had like a little bit of a plan [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3394.22s)]
*  But I think I got nervous and so when I look back on that i'm like man [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3396.14s)]
*  I wish I would have asked some things that were more important, right things [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3399.58s)]
*  I really wanted to ask what I was afraid to right? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3402.46s)]
*  Um, do you look back in certain years of your career like yeah [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3405.3399999999997s)]
*  I could have done some things differently at this time either I was younger or I was [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3408.54s)]
*  I mean when I look back at my career, I would have done everything I did plus more [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3411.74s)]
*  Because I had some great ideas that I didn't get you didn't get a chance to do [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3415.66s)]
*  You know, like what do you mean by that? I mean just the fun [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3419.5s)]
*  The fun [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3422.78s)]
*  I would I would have pushed the envelope even more really just having a good time having a good time because listen [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3424.3s)]
*  NFL is not for long and I had a short window to maximize as much as I could not out of myself [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3429.1800000000003s)]
*  And out of the nfl and I did I did just that which is one of the reasons why i'm still going to this day [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3435.42s)]
*  Pushing forward but looking back you're like man if I didn't know what I know now [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3440.86s)]
*  If I'd have known then what I know now and then I could have done even more right? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3445.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, most definitely but that like is that what you mean or yeah, I mean like physically training more like do you know [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3449.02s)]
*  No, no, no, just my approach to the game in general just on field stuff [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3453.9s)]
*  So what do you why do you feel like your attitude was different at certain years? No, I was the same always [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3457.42s)]
*  I was always authentic myself what you see right now off camera or on camera. It's the same way I was on field [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3461.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know that wasn't it that that wasn't a character [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3467.5s)]
*  That was really me and I just chose not to conform and not to behave the way they said I should [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3469.98s)]
*  Yeah, the way I played in the nfl the same way I played when I was in high school [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3475.8199999999997s)]
*  It was the same way I played when I was in pop Warner just because you paid me millions of dollars [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3478.86s)]
*  I'm not changing who I am just for that. Absolutely not [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3483.42s)]
*  Did you ever have team starters like tell you to pipe like no they loved it never they loved it [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3486.46s)]
*  The referees loved it opposing teams coaches loved it opposing teams players loved it everything everything I did [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3490.7s)]
*  I could see that because there's this kind of a thing like even if somebody's the enemy if they're an enjoyable enemy [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3496.38s)]
*  Do you kind of just thankful to have somebody around that's going to keep you entertained that's going to keep things fun [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=3502.3799999999997s)]

*  And so y'all had to be by the end of the day [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4466.64s)]
*  Y'all were friends because right you were right here the whole time and the other kids would get out of class and have to walk by [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4468.56s)]
*  And so by the end this person became your yeah [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4474.16s)]
*  You had to get over whatever it was because you had to be right there next to each other [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4476.5599999999995s)]
*  I like that. Um, what's a part that you missed about playing? I mean, I know it's kind of a general question [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4479.36s)]
*  What's something you missed about playing that people wouldn't even think about? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4482.96s)]
*  For me, it was competing in practice [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4486.16s)]
*  Even just in practice was fun. I miss it. I miss competing practice. That's what you got. That's that's what's difficult [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4489.04s)]
*  The games on sunday, that's fun. That's the easy part [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4494.799999999999s)]
*  practice and competing preparation [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4498.0s)]
*  I missed that I miss watching film [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4500.16s)]
*  I really I really do I miss watching film [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4502.639999999999s)]
*  Especially on defenses and and in defense of backs and knowing what they were going to do before it even happened [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4505.12s)]
*  I knew it was coming whether it be down in distance first down second down third down [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4510.88s)]
*  All that shifting in motion that they like to do playing around in the secondary. I know what you're doing before you even do it [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4515.36s)]
*  And I missed that I missed being prepared. So the entertainment value I bought. Oh, yeah [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4521.2s)]
*  Was only done because I studied to a t [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4527.280000000001s)]
*  I studied to a t, you know, it's not like i'm just getting up out there. So you weren't there just goofing around [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4530.160000000001s)]
*  No [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4534.4800000000005s)]
*  It looks like it right. There's no way to have that kind of success [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4535.360000000001s)]
*  With without knowing what you're doing without knowing what i'm doing or knowing what you're doing before I even go do it [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4539.280000000001s)]
*  What do you think the nfl could do differently now to make it more exciting? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4544.72s)]
*  Or to make it a better product if anything, I mean listen, it is the best product. It's really there's really nothing else [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4548.240000000001s)]
*  I think nfl's going down man. No, I don't think it's I think people like college better [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4553.84s)]
*  Hell some people like damn wmba better. I don't like absolutely not some people do some young men do [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4558.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't a couple guys do yeah, the nfl will always be the cream of the cream of the crop [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4563.52s)]
*  You think so always I don't there's something about it. Sometimes. I don't know if [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4568.16s)]
*  The field should be bigger. I don't know what should happen [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4573.12s)]
*  It's sometimes I feel like it like the guys have almost gotten too fast where I feel like sometimes with the running backs [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4576.08s)]
*  Is what I do feel like you don't get to see enough good moves because there's not enough space for them to do them in [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4581.6s)]
*  Because everybody's so fast now [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4586.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's true or not [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4588.56s)]
*  But I feel that way sometimes like I don't know if you could have a barry sanders now not because you couldn't have the same guy [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4590.56s)]
*  You just will never have another barry sanders that ain't happening. That might be fair. That is not happening [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4595.76s)]
*  Absolutely, not that might be fair [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4601.040000000001s)]
*  not even close [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4603.76s)]
*  Yeah, it just looked like the you know, like it used to be once you got around the defensive end [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4605.52s)]
*  Wasn't going to get out there to get you. You know most of the time players back then were not as fast now [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4609.52s)]
*  We have you know d lineman even d tackles at running four or five, right? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4614.56s)]
*  But i'm saying does that does that make it tougher for some of these backs to get out of the backfield? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4618.88s)]
*  Not at all. You just have to be that much better [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4624.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4626.72s)]
*  You got to be that much better [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4627.68s)]
*  Yeah, i'm wondering why sometimes it feels like it's not the same as it used to be [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4629.4400000000005s)]
*  It's amazing. I'm not saying that i'm not saying that the guys aren't extremely talented there, right? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4633.280000000001s)]
*  But sometimes I just wonder as a fan [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4637.280000000001s)]
*  Are you a wmba fan? Yeah, absolutely [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=4640.240000000001s)]

*  I think we're having less children now. You see that they're just about to give people money to have more children. You seen that [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5116.08s)]

*  Right the average of it. Yeah [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5171.28s)]
*  That's a good one. That's a good question. It was that was a good one [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5174.719999999999s)]
*  Well, because sometimes it's like I got to do a show or something and i'm like, I don't feel like today's just not my day [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5178.24s)]
*  But I still have to do it right or you just you just wonder at that level because it's [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5183.36s)]
*  You know, it only comes down to 16 sundays. Yeah. Yeah, and suddenly out of that 16. You're gonna have a bad one [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5188.08s)]

*  Consistent as possible [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5195.9s)]
*  But being perfect you strive for perfection. So even if you do fall short, but you're gonna have bad days [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5197.68s)]
*  Do you worry with a lot of these young people that now they have all this max preps and all this video footage and stuff [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5203.92s)]
*  So early do you think that that's a positive or a negative? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5208.32s)]
*  How do you even look at some of that because you have a child now who's nine years old, right? Who's watching himself? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5210.96s)]
*  Either do well or not do well on a on a film, you know [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5217.36s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5221.04s)]
*  Well as a part of it as a part of it you have to evolve with the times the parents have to evolve with the times [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5221.36s)]
*  That we're in now understanding that we're in a social media era. Yeah, and everything's magnified times 10 [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5226.0s)]
*  everything's magnified [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5231.84s)]
*  Yeah, I just wonder like [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5234.4s)]
*  If that's good for a child's psyche or not, either way, it's not going anywhere. It's gonna be here [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5236.32s)]
*  That's your point. It's gonna be you can't romanticize the past because that's not gonna come back exactly [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5240.96s)]
*  So that that at that point at all, it's on the parent [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5246.0s)]
*  helping the child understand [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5249.28s)]
*  Water off a duck's back no matter what it is. Some goes bad [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5252.0s)]
*  In one ear out the other [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5256.16s)]
*  next play [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5258.16s)]
*  What about what the the like? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5259.44s)]
*  NIL is real popular right now [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5261.92s)]
*  Like you have players who will have do you have players that will do get an nil deal [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5263.36s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's like a couple of windows for the nil bring up how many windows are there? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5267.68s)]
*  Because there's some before the season even ends or how many transfer portals in the college? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5272.88s)]
*  season [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5278.64s)]
*  Typically two main transfer portal windows right a window a winter window and a spring window [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5281.52s)]
*  So you can have a guy coming during the winter window and I think they've had this get a deal and then he leaves [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5286.8s)]
*  During the spring window or he wants a better deal, but he just he hadn't even done anything yet [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5292.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's that's the game it is now. It's a pay to play [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5297.04s)]
*  Do you think that helps college football though over time? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5300.72s)]
*  I mean, you think it helps keep players in college for a longer amount of time. I think the fact that [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5302.88s)]
*  colleges in general are [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5306.96s)]
*  Billion dollar institutions or entities in general and have made so much money off players likeness [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5309.42s)]
*  For so long and the players really had nothing [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5315.76s)]
*  So I like the fact that players are now able to take advantage of their likeness and get get paid early [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5318.4800000000005s)]
*  Because everybody's not making it to the nfl right everybody's not gonna get get there [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5324.08s)]
*  So them being able to make some make some change make some cash now while they're playing i'm all for it [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5328.0s)]
*  i'm all for it [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5334.32s)]
*  But do you think there will be players who don't make it because they get money early that it damages them [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5336.24s)]
*  No, absolutely you don't think so. Well, it it could you tell me but getting that getting that kind of money [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5340.4800000000005s)]
*  Early you want more and he's spending it in the club or he buying a uh, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5346.24s)]
*  Wagon we or jeep a jeep wrangler. Well, you're gonna tell me he's not gonna want to well your end goal is nfl [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5350.4800000000005s)]
*  So your end goal is always nfl getting money in college shouldn't change [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5359.28s)]
*  Shouldn't change your long-term vision in your childhood dream of making it to the but you don't think that is it could somebody could suffer [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5363.52s)]
*  Absolutely not because that little bit of that little bit of money is to help family [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5369.4400000000005s)]
*  That's help family. I don't these guys are using it for that though me some of them. No, trust me [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5374.24s)]
*  They're using they're you're using it for family because you don't you know based on where some of these individuals are coming from [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5377.76s)]
*  This is a huge help a huge jump start [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5383.6s)]
*  To being able to help their family, but the end goal the real money. Yeah, is an nfl not nil [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5386.88s)]

*  maybe five [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5398.24s)]
*  But you got people doing dog food commercials and shit in their small town and stuff [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsEsf8R5E3E&t=5400.72s)]
