*  I don't know if you rest with the crack. I don't know. I never really like, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=392.0s)]
*  I feel I have known people that have done crack. I haven't talked to them about it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=395.2s)]
*  When I say I know that I was probably a kid and there was people that worked around where I live [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=399.6s)]
*  with my, and I think they did crack. That was a rumor. Wow. But I don't really, I don't really [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=402.96s)]
*  know what crack does. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=407.04s)]
*  It's a functional, like the my pillow guy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=408.16s)]
*  He does crack? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=411.28s)]
*  He did it his whole building the pillows, you know? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Oh, so good things can come out of it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=416.88s)]
*  There are crack success stories. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=420.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Oh, wow. Is that what the secret is? Is like crack in there. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  They dust a pillow with crack before they ship it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  People are like, oh, this is the best pillow I've ever had in my life. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=431.44s)]
*  This is my pillow. You can't have that shit. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=434.0s)]
*  It's like crack bay, that guy like this, you know? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=436.0s)]
*  He just. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=439.68s)]
*  There's a guy on the assembly line just like as they pass. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=440.88000000000005s)]
*  No, but like crack is like crack. Like is that crack like cocaine or is it like heroin or is it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=445.36s)]
*  like both? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=449.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's bring up a little bit of crack if you can. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=449.92s)]
*  Yeah. And, and, and. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  Bring up a crack rock. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  Crack, I think crack was, it hasn't been as big as it was when we were younger. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=456.88000000000005s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=462.8s)]
*  When we were younger, it was like, you know, sleep breathing crack. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  Like it was in the black population too. I think they, and I think there's documentaries [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=467.6s)]
*  and I haven't seen this, but I believe there's documentaries that they [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  believe it was unleashed on the black community or whatever. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  Oh, is that right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't know if it's true. And I'm not saying that it isn't true. I just haven't seen, I didn't [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=478.56s)]
*  go down. I've never gone down that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=483.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  But. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=485.6s)]
*  How do you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=486.24s)]
*  How do you make it? Can you give me some information on it? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=487.04s)]
*  Yeah. What's the. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  There's a beautiful picture, not beautiful. I mean, there's different images. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=490.0s)]
*  There's an assortment. It looks like crack had a photo session. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=493.12s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=496.64s)]
*  Cause those are all like how you shoot eBay items, you know? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=497.28s)]
*  It's not like in the wild crack. It's like crack in a studio. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=500.32s)]
*  Yeah. It looks like somebody made a charcuterie board. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=503.28s)]
*  I bet you there's been a drug party before where it's been laid out like charcuterie. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=509.28s)]
*  Oh. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=513.2s)]
*  Like in the high end, the high end drug parties, like in the hills and stuff. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=513.52s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=517.44s)]
*  It was like a little Brejute and like a little bit like. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=517.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. A little Camembert. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=519.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=521.84s)]
*  A little Sauvignon Crock. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=522.48s)]
*  Really appealing too. Like people went to the party and they never did drugs before, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=526.96s)]
*  but then they were like, looks good though. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=530.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. They're like, oh, there's no way that crack rock doesn't go with that fig jam. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=533.36s)]
*  Fig jam is my favorite thing on that charcuterie board. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=538.56s)]
*  It's not always on there, but it is. It's only it gives you the sweetness [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=540.96s)]
*  that you need to cut through. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=544.96s)]
*  Yeah. I love a good fig jam. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=546.24s)]
*  You know, it's undervalued. I think it's kind of the, it's underappreciated. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=548.48s)]
*  Yet it's costly, which is really the dichotomy about fig jam. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=555.6s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=559.36s)]
*  Undervalued, but overpriced. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=560.08s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  When was the last time you had fig jam? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=564.72s)]
*  I think when you're saying it, when someone is, when I've been at someone's house that has, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  that has, I guess, rich or whatever, and they have fancy wine corkers or whatever, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=572.72s)]
*  like that bottle of the wine, like. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=579.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=581.44s)]
*  And then they'll have a charcuterie board sometimes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=581.84s)]
*  But I got a charcuterie board for the Super Bowl. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  You did it, had fig jam on it? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=587.68s)]
*  Yeah, had fig jam on it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=588.88s)]
*  Really? But it also had jalapeno poppers on it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=590.24s)]
*  It did. Well, I did have wings as well. I had wings. I had other things. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=593.28s)]
*  Normally we'll make it, but then my lady found someone who did it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=597.52s)]
*  She went to a party and they had it and she was like, whoa. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=602.72s)]
*  And she got the number and then we ordered it and they bring it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  It was like on a four foot board. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=607.52s)]
*  And you know, you got to pay the lecture for it, but for the guests, you know. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  It's almost a level of like how rich you're willing to be when you go down the charcuterie [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=612.8s)]
*  boards, because there's also different sizes. There's the Noah's Ark. There's the, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=617.04s)]
*  and you can go all the way down to like the Titanic. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=622.24s)]
*  The Santa Maria. Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. There's like the Nina. Sorry. And that's your joke, dude. I stepped on it, but. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  And yeah. And you can go all the way down to like Titanic door, like the small little. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=632.24s)]
*  Yeah. Don't ever let go. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=635.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You never want to let go. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=636.88s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=639.04s)]
*  I thought I would, but I will tell you though, I, I stood there calculating [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  how much the woman actually paid, like the actual wholesale costs. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  Cause I was like, there was some, there was some things on there that there are some things on [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  that that make you go, oh, okay. But they're like, you know, they're throughout, but then [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=653.52s)]
*  there's also like, you know, grapes, just cheap, you know? So I'm like looking at it and I'm like, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=657.68s)]
*  man, I guess it's labor intensive. I'll give her that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=662.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=665.12s)]
*  Cause I felt like she probably could have got away with everything on there for like under 200. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=665.52s)]
*  And it was probably like 450 or something like that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=669.04s)]
*  Oh wow. 450. It was like four feet. Well, we had like 35 people. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's fair. Yeah. Oh yeah. If it feeds 35, dude, I'll fucking get one of those every. Yeah. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  But then like not every, we had so much food, not everyone ate it. And then I have like [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=680.16s)]
*  so much excess charcuterie and then I feel guilty because I'm like, I have to eat this. I can't [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  piss away money like this. Yeah. So I'm just, I was eating charcuterie for like six, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  seven days past the soup bowl. Really? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Just having olives and pecans and just what? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=694.24s)]
*  Yeah. But you know what? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=697.04s)]
*  11 pistachios. Like they always have like seven or eight like things. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. There's unidentified things all the time. I gotta like Google photo it. I don't even know. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=702.32s)]
*  I'm like, what is this? It's like, I don't even know if it's cheese. It's a cream. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=707.36s)]
*  There's nuts. I never seen them on there before. Oh, it gets twigs. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  Very vague towards the end. Like there's like, sometimes there'll be like a hoof meat. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  There will be like something called a neighborhood sausage. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=720.24s)]
*  They give you like a legend, like a key. You're like, oh, you got to try. That's a neighborhood [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=728.08s)]
*  sausage. But it's so much more depressing eating it the week after because it's bagged in like [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=732.64s)]
*  sandwich bags in the fridge. And so now I'm just pulling out different bags of unidentified meats [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=737.76s)]
*  and like tasting it. And like the sodium levels that week were probably through the roof really. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=742.96s)]
*  I retained a lot of water that week. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's another big issue. I think is one of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=748.24s)]
*  the side effects of charcuterie, charcuterie boards is gout probably and severe salt retention. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=753.12s)]
*  My buddy's daddy, if he had too much salt, he couldn't talk. And, and so I miss you, man. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=761.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. So he'd get his fucking dad, like that would be drunk and he'd get him. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=767.92s)]
*  He'd get a bunch of fucking like, he'd keep giving him potato chips. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=773.12s)]
*  If you know, he's going to like steal the car that night the day before, if you like give his [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=778.64s)]
*  dad just like a family, like a Costco bag of ruffles. So he wouldn't chew them out when he got home. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=782.24s)]
*  He would just look at them like furrowed. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=790.96s)]
*  You ever have gout? No, I never had. I'm a stepdad, had it. I think it's basically salt builds up like [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  in the bins of your body, huh? I self-diagnosed gout. You just said you had it? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=805.44s)]
*  Yeah, I just said I was trying to will it. Thank you for admitting it. A lot of people [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=812.0s)]
*  will have fucking like I had like a stepdad probably couldn't even move his arms or anything. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=816.56s)]
*  He's like, I don't have anything wrong. And meanwhile, it's like Randy and a Christmas story. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=820.4s)]
*  No, I was getting these sharp pains. Is that gout stuff? Yeah, right there, right there. Oh wow. I [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=831.36s)]
*  never even googled gout and that's where I had it. Gout happens when you rate a URAT. That's like a [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=836.8s)]
*  t-shirt. Gout happens. Gout happens. Yeah. I didn't mean to cut you off. No, and that is definitely a [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=842.24s)]
*  market that as we age we can get into. I think gout happens. Gout happens, right? Oh, my stepdad [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=847.76s)]
*  would wear that every day. He'd wear the helmet. He's got it so bad, dude. He's a fucking, he shows [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=854.4s)]
*  up on the periodic table at elements. That dude has so much salt in him. That dude's fucking probably [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=861.2s)]
*  got iodine in him. That's not good. You ever talk to him about it? We mentioned it. You should cut [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=866.0s)]
*  his sodium down, you know? We mentioned it. Anything you do for him? He's born free. He wears a shirt that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=871.12s)]
*  says born free all the time. So that's not the kind of guy you can approach about their self. I think [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=875.2s)]
*  born free essentially means gout happens. Yeah, that's an interchangeable shirt. No, I had this [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=878.6400000000001s)]
*  shooting pain. In your foot? Out of nowhere. Out of nowhere. But I mean like your foot locks up and [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=887.04s)]
*  you can't, you would have to tip toe and put your weight on the other foot. Out of nowhere, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=892.56s)]
*  And then what happened, could happen for two minutes, could happen for like five minutes, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=897.5999999999999s)]
*  ten minutes. And then it would just magically, like a charley horse, it would just go away. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  And I didn't really know what it was. I thought I kind of, I thought I broke my toe or I had [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  something wrong with the actual like infrastructure in there. And it would [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=912.08s)]
*  reoccur and go away and reoccur. And I was like, I gotta talk to my dad. So I went and I got x-rays [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=916.72s)]
*  and they were like, it's fine. There's nothing wrong with it. Like you're full of shit. And I [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=921.76s)]
*  realized, God, because it's not just salt. I heard like, well it is meats and stuff. So I guess that [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=925.44s)]
*  is salt. Yep. Salt shrimp I know have it. Shit, that's the seafood. Seafood is high in sodium. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=930.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't really, really know that. And I eat seafood thinking like, oh, it's lean. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=936.48s)]
*  It's good protein, you know? And yeah, it's the lean cuisine of the ocean kind of. It is. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=941.44s)]
*  And then I realized, I realized I guess you can have it. You can have flare ups and it goes away. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=950.0s)]
*  Cause I haven't now, not going to, what this is going to be, this is going to suck. Cause I know [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=955.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to bring it back now by saying it, but I haven't really had it in like a year or a year [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=959.36s)]
*  and a half. But there was times where I would get it like every few days and it would strike [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=964.32s)]
*  anywhere at the most inopportune times. Yeah. Thank you though. You know, prayers, you know, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  anything you could do for me. I love how like you really, you actually really just got empathy for [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=974.88s)]
*  them from my mouth. Oh, well I watched my stepdad. He would have so much like flare up or whatever. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=980.72s)]
*  He couldn't even, my stepmom would go put a blanket on him. He couldn't even like, even an [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=985.2800000000001s)]
*  Afghan or whatever, couldn't touch his skin. It would fucking hurt him too much. Let's give [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=991.04s)]
*  this information though. Gout happens when urate, a substance in your body builds up and forms [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=996.0s)]
*  needle shaped crystals in your joints. I didn't even know what that was. God. Yeah. I got, I [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1000.64s)]
*  had, I guess I had needle shaped crystals. This leads to pain, swelling, redness and changes in [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1007.12s)]
*  the movement and use of the affected joint. However, not everyone with high urate levels [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1013.36s)]
*  develop gout. And does gout just go away? Maybe look that up how it comes and goes away. Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1018.32s)]
*  The pain is, is like, you can't use the foot. Yeah. You literally like, it's almost like you [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1027.92s)]
*  need a crutch, but you don't have one because you never know when you're short friend. Yeah. You [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1034.8s)]
*  need, yeah. You need anything really, any kind of support at all. Gout can go away or return again [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  and again. Oh my gosh, dude. This is like one of those, one of those Robert Pattinson movies. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1045.68s)]
*  Some people will go months or even years without having another gout attack or very rarely. They [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1051.44s)]
*  may never have another one. Yeah. It's like the mafia. Like you never know when it's lurking [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  over your shoulder. Like it threatens you once. And then you just be like, you got to fall online. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1060.8s)]
*  I have psoriasis, which is the same exact thing. I got a lot of like, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1066.48s)]
*  like, like, like, like autoimmune things that like threaten me, then they go away, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1069.6799999999998s)]
*  but they always, there's always a threat of them again. Yeah. Yeah. That's one thing I just, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  I guess about growing up is that that stuff starts to happen. Your special is. Yeah. It's [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1080.8799999999999s)]
*  called terrified. I shot at the Vic in Chicago back in December. Is my, this is my first actual [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1088.8s)]
*  one on anything I recorded. Yeah. I have some like television sets and like, you know, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  this is not happening, this and that, but like most of my stuff, I just never put it out there. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1099.4399999999998s)]
*  So like, I finally like had the time, the runway to do it. So like big, it's a big deal for me [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  because like people, like a lot of, a lot of people aren't educated that I am a standup, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1108.0s)]
*  you know, like my, my fans are, but like just, you know, I want to reach like, you know, you know, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1111.76s)]
*  so it's like, this is a kind of like my, you know, hopefully it'll reach a lot of people. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I remember why one of you and I got on a show together at a bookstore in New York. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1119.92s)]
*  I remember, I think when you were first starting to do comedy. Yeah. Like it's well, now let's [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1126.48s)]
*  talk about it about a proper standard, probably been about eight, eight years and so now, yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1131.04s)]
*  I actually was just so, so funny because I was like, I was talking to my lady that was coming [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1136.64s)]
*  here and we started talking about you and I actually, I went and looked at it because we, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1141.04s)]
*  it was like eight, nine years ago, you, you visited, we went, we went out together for [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1146.96s)]
*  Halloween. Yeah. And I found a photo of us. Yeah. I got, I found the photo list and I was like, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1151.68s)]
*  I went, it was that far back, but I had to go in like my, this is, this is you, this, you, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1157.2s)]
*  you dressed as a newsie and I was like a run DMC dude. That was a, that was a fun night. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1162.88s)]
*  Dude, that was a fun night. I remember we went to a couple of good bars. Yeah. We were hopping [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  that was, dude, that was nine years ago. I can't believe I know. And then I found this one, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1174.08s)]
*  which I was like, I guess I forgot we did this, but we did a show together, me, you and Adam [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1178.72s)]
*  Ray at the house of blues in San Diego. Do you even remember that? I remember I showed up there [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1182.08s)]
*  with luggage for some reason. I remember that. I definitely remember that. And cause I, yeah, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1187.44s)]
*  I just remember cause sometimes you don't have luggage with you. Yeah. Most of your life, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1195.76s)]
*  you don't have luggage, right? No, not most of the days. Yeah. So most so, so when I have luggage, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1199.12s)]
*  sometimes I remember it, especially if you're with luggage at a place that you shouldn't have [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1203.12s)]
*  lunch. It always feels so weird. Oh, if you go to lunch or somewhere and you have to go to the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1206.8s)]
*  airport after you fucking walk into like a, um, you know, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of a good [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1211.36s)]
*  place. That's well, that place is closed down, but even like a macaroni grill, like a semi nice place [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1218.8799999999999s)]
*  where, and you got the luggage by your seat, you know, it's by your seat and then people are like [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  walking by and you're like, yeah, I know. Especially in New York. I'm sure if you go to a cafe [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1229.52s)]
*  cause a luggage will take up probably 7% of a cafe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would say so. Yeah, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1235.6s)]
*  absolutely. And then forget about it. If you have a large, if I have you large, you probably just [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1241.52s)]
*  got to eat in the park. You probably can't get into the doorway. Well, you've done, I mean, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1245.2s)]
*  at that point, that's how homelessness starts. I think it's somebody that's somebody is meeting [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1251.44s)]
*  somebody. They're on their last leg. They're headed out of town and they're, they're meeting [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1256.72s)]
*  somebody for lunch. Somebody's like, look, I'll buy you a meal. And you realize your luggage is too [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1261.2s)]
*  big to get into the cafe. And they're like, you got to eat in the park. I just got new luggage. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1266.4s)]
*  So I'm like feeling good about it. Yeah. My old, I was still using a, like the cloth one, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1270.08s)]
*  like not a hard case. I liked the cloth one because it used to like zipper, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1275.2s)]
*  the, like the flat was thin and the whole depth was one side. And I was, I was hesitant to get, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1279.04s)]
*  you were using that style. I was doing that with just the two wheels that you had to lug, like, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1284.72s)]
*  on, like it was like a hand truck. I respect the two wheels. Yeah. Yeah. And I, you know, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1288.8s)]
*  and I ended up getting that one because my shit busted while I was at the airport. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1292.88s)]
*  And then I had to run down and get luggage at the airport and I bought it and I was like, all right. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1297.3600000000001s)]
*  And then I was like, Oh man, it was, it was like a can, you know, it wasn't like hard case too. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1301.52s)]
*  So it got, you know, wet and dry and wet and dry. But I liked that it was deep, you know? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1307.2s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I guess that's true. You have one side is deep. You're not deciding what side to put stuff on. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1313.92s)]
*  It wasn't a split, you know? And I resisted the hard case split for so long. And, and then finally, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  this luggage, I couldn't get the handle up anymore. I still, I still had it for like three months with [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1324.64s)]
*  no hand, couldn't get the handle up. I was like just reaching low and just pulling. I just, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1328.72s)]
*  cause I just, I don't know. I just like, don't have time. And I was like, I, you know what it is? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1334.3200000000002s)]
*  I want to be a smart consumer. Yeah. And I didn't have the time to do the research on the new luggage. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1338.56s)]
*  And so I just was like, I'm going to do it. And then one day I just like, I can't do this anymore. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1345.76s)]
*  Yeah. And I committed and I got the new hard, hard case. I'm like trying to get out of a marriage. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1349.6s)]
*  I'm going to stay with this baby. Just the, just a few, just so I know that I really like, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1356.24s)]
*  I found somebody else. And now I do the split hard top and you know what? I was free for nothing. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1359.92s)]
*  Really? It's got four wheels. It glides effortlessly. It's impermeable to liquids. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1365.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. And it's not really that bad. Cause I was like, oh, what if I need something that is like [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1372.24s)]
*  tall in a split? I'm not going to be able to do it because one side zips. So it's not like you can [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=1377.76s)]

*  there young enough so that we were allowed to be because all the buildings like were surrounded [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=5061.2s)]
*  like a courtyard parking lot pool like in the middle and so like our parents were like you [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=5066.639999999999s)]

*  yeah a little nugget and put it in and then put it on the hook and we did it with wonder bread so I [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6457.759999999999s)]
*  so I would just feed it wonder bread and you know it wasn't till way after that I realized like [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6461.44s)]
*  the fish would eat like I would break it and throw it in chunks and it would suck it right in and then [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6464.96s)]
*  shoot it right back out you know some of them wouldn't come back out but most of them would [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6469.2s)]
*  shoot back out and I'd be like I just was like he's full yeah but I guess he just didn't want [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6474.16s)]
*  white bread they can take it in yeah so I would so they would always die oh so I felt so bad so [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6479.28s)]
*  then I realized one day like I was like the fish store because it was a there was a fish store [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6485.76s)]

*  cross the street so we can go to the fish store without crossing the street so one day I'm in [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6494.32s)]
*  there and I'm like oh there's these bubbles like I don't have that I gotta get bubbles yeah so one [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=6497.76s)]

*  like I don't want people to be like come out to me like hey how's your wife like it's like [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8529.76s)]
*  you know but um that's a good point yeah but but so it's even I think it's a little [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8534.0s)]
*  like more with the daughter yeah it's like super protective you know what I mean but but I it's the [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8539.2s)]

*  a lot I think about like if I have kids would I let people know do I feel like people need to know [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8565.119999999999s)]
*  but then also do I want to be honest about my own life but then who am I being honest to like [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8570.32s)]
*  can I still just be honest to myself and be like a good family man I think with podcasting I think [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8576.88s)]
*  it gets a little different because it's like a lot of times we do share stuff that's real to us [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8582.72s)]
*  and so then people get to know us in a different element and you've been doing it so long right [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8588.8s)]
*  yeah so talk for so many hours and then sometimes you'll see someone come up to you and they know [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8593.039999999999s)]
*  something intimate and you're like oh I guess I because we get so comfortable with each other [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGD9HFWn3I&t=8596.88s)]
