*  Oh, gotcha. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=151.2s)]
*  All right, cool, cool. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=152.2s)]
*  You know, so people could just do it at home. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=153.2s)]
*  Oh, I never come empty handed to anything, but I've been in limbo all day, so this is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=154.2s)]
*  the best I can do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=157.84s)]
*  I heard you're on again, off again, quitting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=159.56s)]
*  Damn, you brought me this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Air bar. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=163.76s)]
*  Sometimes you quit and sometimes you're not. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=165.16s)]
*  But mostly you're trying to quit. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=167.64s)]
*  So I feel like an ass, but no, it's nice of you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=168.88s)]
*  Very sweet of you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=173.12s)]
*  This is very, yeah, it's almost like the first Thanksgiving or whatever. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=174.12s)]
*  You know, whenever they did that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=178.72s)]
*  Yeah, so that's very nice. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=180.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=181.6s)]
*  And I've actually been doing good about quitting. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=182.6s)]
*  I think the tough part is the worst thing about quitting is that you have to every day [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  you're like, I'm going to quit and then you don't. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=191.0s)]
*  And then you set yourself up for failure. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=192.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's a commitment that I just I don't have the willpower to do. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=195.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=199.48s)]
*  Have you tried it or no? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=200.48s)]
*  I was supposed to start dry January yesterday and I just didn't. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=201.48s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=203.48s)]
*  I don't have the willpower. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=204.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=205.48s)]
*  I wanted to stop this going on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=206.48s)]
*  So we're gonna try again today. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=208.84s)]
*  You got it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=210.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's another day. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=211.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's the thing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=212.44s)]
*  January is a lot of pressure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=213.44s)]
*  You know, it's a lot of pressure at the beginning of the year to get it all right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=214.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  But for what though? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Like we're just new all of a sudden. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna flip it off. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=220.84s)]
*  Well, I think that's kind of the goal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=221.84s)]
*  I think that's the goal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=223.28s)]
*  It just feels kind of tough, you know. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=224.28s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of pressure. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  It is a lot of pressure, dude. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=227.32000000000002s)]
*  God, being alive is just damn. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a lot sometimes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=231.84s)]
*  You know, it just feels like a lot. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  Grace O'Malley, thanks for coming in today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=237.08s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=238.68s)]
*  I'm super pumped. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=239.68s)]
*  I tried to play it really cool the other day, but I am a very big fan. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=240.68s)]
*  Oh, thanks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=243.08s)]
*  Big fan. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=244.08s)]

*  Yeah, I'm a big fan of yours too. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=246.08s)]
*  You always just seem like a just like such a human. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=247.08s)]
*  I mean, why not? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=250.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=251.72s)]
*  Like, I don't know what's wrong with half of these people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=252.72s)]
*  Everyone's kind of fucking out of control. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=253.72s)]
*  Yeah, things are. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  I think, well, I think if people get into like the spotlight or get like popularity, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  popularity, ego, all that stuff is super dangerous, you know. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=263.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=266.44s)]
*  And you don't realize it sometimes like you can be getting infected by it or that like [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=267.44s)]
*  or suddenly you'll try to super manage how you're perceived, which some of that's normal [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  because you want to protect yourself. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=276.36s)]
*  I think all of that's just it's scary. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=278.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=280.8s)]
*  I mean, like you just got to you got to say you got to be yourself. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=281.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=285.8s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=286.8s)]
*  You just got to be yourself. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=287.8s)]
*  But if yourself is an asshole, then maybe you should change. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=288.8s)]
*  If yourself's an asshole, bro. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=291.8s)]
*  Yeah, because they got people out there now that are not even gay that are being gay. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=294.8s)]
*  They have all types of people like fake Native Americans. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Every week, they're busting like one of these politicians for saying they were Honduran [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  or something, you know, just a lot of bullshit. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=309.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=311.76s)]
*  I wish I had the 23 and me to claim one of those things, because I feel like if you can [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=312.76s)]

*  He's like breastfeeding and he orders another tit or whatever. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=341.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=345.96000000000004s)]

*  It's the most Irish shit. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  It's about pretty much the way I was. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  He like orders around for everybody in the room or something. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  It's some they're breastfeeding it like a family thing or whatever, like a birthday or [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  whatever. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=357.76s)]
*  One of my worst jokes I ever wrote was like one of my first ones was that I'm so Irish [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=358.76s)]
*  that I was breastfed Guinness. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=363.6s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but it is what it is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's a rough one kind of. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=369.04s)]
*  I told some rough. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=370.56s)]
*  Oh, oh, my one of my first jokes is like, oh, I need a job, a blow job. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=371.56s)]
*  That's classic though. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=376.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=377.48s)]

*  Thanks. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=379.48s)]
*  We have each other. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=380.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=381.48s)]
*  It was pretty bad. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=382.48s)]
*  So, yeah, I stopped by the Comedy Club the other night and you were doing stand up. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=383.48s)]
*  How long? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  So how long have you been doing stand up? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=388.20000000000005s)]
*  Just so because some audience won't know you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  So you're a podcaster and a comedian. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  And how long have you been doing stand up? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=395.12s)]
*  So I moved to New York in 2020. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  I was doing it like here and there on like the streets because you had to do it like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  outside at the time. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=402.52s)]
*  And I was COVID because of COVID. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=403.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=405.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=406.76s)]
*  And so I did like on and off here and there, but started taking it serious around January [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=407.76s)]
*  of this last year. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=411.56s)]
*  OK, 2024. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=413.56s)]
*  2024. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=414.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=415.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=416.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=417.56s)]
*  And so what did that mean? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=418.56s)]
*  Taking it serious, like just getting up more, like getting into like the circuits or what? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=419.56s)]
*  It's like an oxymoron saying taking it serious because it's comedy, but just like going up [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  as much as I could, like networking, I guess, and putting myself out there kind of thing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  So I've been going up as much as I could. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  And Whitney Cummings ended up taking me on the road with her. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=433.92s)]
*  Oh, Whitney took you on the road with her. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=437.72s)]
*  My apologies. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=439.24s)]
*  Whitney did? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=440.24s)]
*  Yeah, she did. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=441.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's awesome. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=442.24s)]
*  She was sick. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=443.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=444.24s)]
*  So she put the fire under my ass. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=445.24s)]
*  She came on. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=446.24s)]
*  I used to have a podcast. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=447.24s)]
*  It's no longer. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=448.24s)]
*  She came on as a guest and she was like, I fuck with you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=449.72s)]
*  You should open for me. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, you don't want it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=454.08s)]
*  You don't want that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=456.12s)]
*  And she was like, no, just do it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=457.8s)]
*  Just say yes and it'll all follow. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=460.12s)]
*  So she put the fire under my ass and I just grinded. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=463.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=466.08s)]
*  And so you were just... [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=467.08s)]
*  Now, was it like you were overnight suddenly on stage having to do a lot of time or no? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=468.08s)]
*  So she gave me 15, which turned into 20. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  And she just kept at... [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=474.6s)]
*  I guess I was doing something right because she kept adding me to more cities. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=476.0s)]
*  So I was like, all right, so I guess I'm doing pretty good. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=479.52s)]
*  That was nice. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  So you're from... [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  Originally, you're from where at? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm from Boston, but like outside of Boston. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=486.23999999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=488.24s)]
*  And do people from outside of Boston look differently at people than inside of Boston? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=489.24s)]
*  Oh, culturally, probably. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=493.24s)]
*  There was this thing in the 70s called busing where they brought African-American children [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  into the city. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=503.76s)]
*  Preschooling and stuff? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=505.56s)]
*  Preschooling, yeah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=506.56s)]
*  So some people didn't like that, so those people, they left. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=507.56s)]
*  And that is unfortunately where I come from. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=512.72s)]
*  Oh, that's your family. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=515.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=516.56s)]
*  You were birthed out of those people. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=517.56s)]
*  Yeah, those were those guys. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=518.56s)]
*  People make their choices, you know. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=520.16s)]
*  They have... [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=523.16s)]
*  Yeah, they have... [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=524.16s)]
*  Yeah, because Boston's interesting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=525.16s)]
*  They got a lot of racism up there, you know? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=526.16s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not as loud as it is down here. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=527.8s)]
*  Yeah, the South, it's more... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=532.72s)]
*  The South has more of that kind of slave magic history, you know? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=534.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=537.4000000000001s)]
*  We just have just little innuendos of bad history and bad things we did, I guess. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=538.4000000000001s)]
*  It's still up there though, for sure. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=545.72s)]
*  It depends on which side you're on, but yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=547.36s)]
*  You should just meet my dad. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=548.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=549.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=550.88s)]
*  You'll see it there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=551.88s)]
*  Is he a fireman or no? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=552.88s)]
*  No, he wanted to be a police officer, ended up being an electrician, but he fucked that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=553.88s)]
*  up too. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=557.2s)]
*  What, doing electricity? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=558.2s)]
*  Yeah, he got electrocuted. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=559.2s)]
*  Oh, he did? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=560.2s)]
*  Yeah, on the job. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=561.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=563.08s)]
*  And he said he saw God, he started to be a believer, and Tyler Childers walked him into [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=564.08s)]
*  heaven when he died. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=568.6400000000001s)]
*  Tyler Childers? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=569.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes, Childers, yes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=570.6400000000001s)]
*  The musician? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=571.6400000000001s)]
*  The musician. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=572.6400000000001s)]
*  Walked him into the pearly gates. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=573.6400000000001s)]
*  So that's my father. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=575.6s)]
*  You almost got to believe him. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=577.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=578.84s)]
*  But that guy's still alive, so I don't know what that illusion was with him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=579.84s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=585.24s)]
*  I'm not really sure. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=586.24s)]
*  Yeah, why would a guy who's not even dead come and help you? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=587.24s)]
*  That's nice of him. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=590.6400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, like you were having a bad dream, and you woke up and you were blasted. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=596.08s)]
*  Yeah, being electrocuted, it's kind of under, it's not, it doesn't get as much credit as [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=600.08s)]
*  it deserves, really. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=607.96s)]

*  from our home or whatever, and they had, they would let you ride the rides the day before [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=622.68s)]

*  whatever and ever, you know, and I tried to get off one of the rides and I like grabbed [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  two different railings and I think I connected some circuit or whatever, so I was just like [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  this, you know. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=644.56s)]
*  Did your friends see your skeleton, like the cartoons? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  No, I don't know, my friends, they kind of ran off, they're like, oh, something's, you [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=648.28s)]
*  know, this isn't, we don't want to be involved. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=652.04s)]

*  Yeah, this guy's not doing good, we don't want to be involved in it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=655.4s)]
*  And some guy called me, I think a f***er or whatever, and kicked me in the back. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=658.64s)]
*  And I was like, okay, he saved my life, but he still called me a f***er. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  So I was like, well, you know, but that's what you get kind of around the carnival. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=665.4s)]
*  But that time, and then I was walking behind a food truck that was serving crab meat or [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=669.92s)]
*  whatever, which I don't trust. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=674.24s)]
*  That sounds really wrong, too. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=675.44s)]
*  Oh, it's yeah, I don't trust crab meat that's that close to like a gas tank, I think, you [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=677.0400000000001s)]

*  Somebody was telling me about that and they were saying that you thought that nobody [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=743.4s)]
*  would recognize you in that thing. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=747.28s)]

*  Yeah, I didn't think it was that big of a deal. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=750.76s)]
*  I thought everybody would have them, you know, and that's going to make people do [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=752.6800000000001s)]

*  No, it was all horrible. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=762.6s)]
*  Because whenever you first got them, I got home. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=763.84s)]
*  I ordered like five years ago, right? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=766.84s)]
*  Like it was because it was a hundred bucks. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=768.52s)]
*  Oh, that's like putting it on the wishlist. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=769.8s)]
*  OK, right. So for a hundred bucks, you could be like, I got a cyber truck coming. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=771.48s)]

*  So I was like, yeah, I'm getting a cyber truck or whatever. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=779.08s)]
*  And then I kept like bothering Elon on Twitter. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=781.52s)]
*  Where are they? You know, give them, you know. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=784.56s)]

*  saying stuff like that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=795.0s)]
*  And then finally, one day I got home, I'd been on time for a few weeks [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=796.6s)]
*  and it was in my garage. Oh, sick. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=801.28s)]
*  And so I was like, holy shit, dude. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=803.56s)]
*  And at first, when you would drive down the street, people would like [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=805.84s)]
*  there were people cheering people at American flags. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=809.8s)]
*  There were Mexican people. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=813.04s)]
*  There were Mexican people out there doing this and dancing or whatever. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=814.4s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=818.9599999999999s)]

*  But really, they had like, we are the champions. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=828.0s)]
*  It was like gay people. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  People were coming out of the closet in front of you. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=831.52s)]
*  You had girls flashing titties. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=833.36s)]
*  It was a lot. Yeah, it was just a lot going on, you know. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=834.8399999999999s)]
*  And and yeah, I did. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=838.16s)]
*  I thought it automatically would have [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=840.12s)]
*  extra darkness on the windows, you know. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=844.48s)]
*  And it didn't. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=847.32s)]
*  So for a long time, I thought it was like, yeah, obviously [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=848.24s)]
*  it's I can't, you know, I can just drive. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=851.8s)]
*  You know, there was extra darkness. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=854.2s)]
*  And then and then my buddy was like, you got to get those things tinted. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=856.12s)]
*  I was like, oh, shit, man, they're not tinted. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=860.04s)]
*  And then so finally I did get them tinted. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=861.92s)]
*  Well, what was it run DMC or the or? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=863.88s)]
*  Fuck. I forget who it was, but they said tinted windows don't mean nothing. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=867.72s)]
*  They know who's inside. Really? Yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=871.04s)]
*  Oh, so you're fucked. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=872.96s)]
*  Oh, and and so is the guy who waited five years for a cyber truck just to blow it up. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=875.12s)]
*  What a science experiment. Oh, yes. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=881.72s)]
*  I just did that. Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=883.12s)]
*  Bring that up, dude. Actually, you know what's funny? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=885.04s)]
*  I thought about getting like a big fuse and putting it like hanging out of. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=886.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a goodie. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=892.32s)]
*  Oh, he did it for Fourth of July. He did it for New Year's. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=894.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what it does look like. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=897.2s)]
*  It does look like a spectacle. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=898.84s)]
*  I think it was a political point in front of Trump. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=899.88s)]
*  Oh, in front of Trump Tower. Wow. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=903.28s)]
*  I think one person did die. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=905.0s)]
*  So it's tough to find a joke there. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=906.28s)]
*  But I mean, it was probably some Middle Easterners like getting a picture next to it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=908.08s)]
*  People are like, can we get this? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=911.28s)]
*  Can we? And you're just like, leave me alone. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=913.64s)]
*  I'm going to blow a lid. Yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=917.48s)]
*  Don't come ask me. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=919.24s)]
*  But the problem is, the horn sounds a little bit effeminate, too. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=920.6s)]
*  Does it? Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=923.56s)]
*  If you hit the horn, like a couple of gay dudes will kind of walk over. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=925.0s)]
*  Oh, hi. You need something? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=927.76s)]
*  It's all prostitutes that work the streets. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=931.96s)]
*  Do they? Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=935.48s)]
*  Not here. They don't have to anymore, right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=936.6s)]
*  Where's there some good, where's streetwalkers still in America? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=938.08s)]
*  Can you pull that up, please? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=940.96s)]
*  Because I've been looking. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=942.6s)]
*  I've told my friends before, I don't get laid much. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=943.76s)]
*  That's just a fact about me. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=947.04s)]
*  But I told my friends, just surprise me with a hooker one day. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=948.6s)]
*  And don't tell me it's a hooker. A male hooker? A male hooker. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=952.36s)]

*  Nevada's largest commercial sex market in the United States [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=966.2800000000001s)]
*  when adjusted for population. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=969.4000000000001s)]
*  OK, number of prostitutes people. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=971.12s)]
*  Nevada has more than twice as many prostitutes people per capita [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=973.44s)]
*  as California and 63 percent more than New York. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=976.36s)]
*  All right. So they still have brothels there. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=979.32s)]
*  All right. So I'm moving, I'm moving to Nevada. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=981.96s)]
*  Might as well get to Nevada to get it. Yeah, there we go. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=984.24s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what would that be like for a, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=986.08s)]
*  for a woman, because I've gotten a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=988.96s)]
*  a lady of the night or whatever they're called, a mystical. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=992.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just one time. I don't know what they call them. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=995.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a mystical puss. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=997.48s)]
*  Yeah, I got one in Amsterdam, right, where people go get them. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=998.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's where you that's like the prize. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1001.48s)]

*  you know, midnight couture or whatever, you know. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1008.44s)]
*  And so I went there and oh, here was the funny part. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1011.32s)]
*  My buddy and I, both of us like, not like [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1015.6800000000001s)]

*  So we both like went off by ourselves. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1020.52s)]
*  You stay separate rooms like, all right, man. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1022.48s)]
*  Night, bud. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1025.16s)]
*  And then saw each other there. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1027.32s)]
*  We're like, oh, that's tough. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1029.0s)]
*  That's why you just have to embrace it [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1030.44s)]
*  and then just do a force over something. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1032.2s)]
*  But here was a sad part of it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1035.16s)]
*  You go in there and it seems like it's very alluring. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1036.52s)]
*  And the mirage of it is very compelling. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  But you go in there and right when you go in their door, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1042.4s)]
*  because they're standing out there [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1045.4s)]
*  and there's kind of some red lights inside of the room. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1046.3600000000001s)]
*  You go in there in the main door and there's like a bouncer guy right there. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1048.24s)]
*  And he's very, you know, tough guy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  And he says something real tough or something. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1055.4s)]
*  And then you kind of go like that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1057.68s)]
*  And then you go into the room and it's very much like a doctor's room. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1059.52s)]
*  They're like everything's kind of like covered in like paper or plastic. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1062.72s)]

*  it feels very clinical. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1072.8s)]
*  Clinical. OK, so it's routine. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1076.28s)]
*  It's like an appointment. Right. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1078.1599999999999s)]

*  getting smashed so much or doing a lot of sex or whatever. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1598.68s)]
*  I think when you start having the talk is when they develop more of a daddy problem. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1602.04s)]
*  I was like, there's nothing you can do as a father. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1606.28s)]
*  I feel like it's just like their decision to be what they want to do. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=1608.24s)]

*  Yeah, she's doing her thing. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2057.32s)]
*  I'm doing my thing and I still love her. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2058.88s)]
*  So. I'm being a politician right now. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2062.0s)]
*  Now, you know, it's interesting is [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2066.44s)]
*  I've had times where I was like I was going through moments with friends and stuff, you know, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2070.52s)]
*  and and most of them even doubt over time. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2074.52s)]
*  Yeah. But the toughest part about it like was in the like the times [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2076.84s)]
*  where we weren't getting along or we're having differences. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  That I didn't have my friend at times. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2083.32s)]
*  That was really the shittiest part. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. It was like even though I would have like a leg to stand on about why I was upset about stuff. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2087.04s)]
*  Sometimes I'd be like, I'd be like, man, fuck, Scott, dude. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2091.32s)]
*  I got to call Scott right now and tell him I couldn't even call my friend. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2095.6800000000003s)]
*  I was so fucking fired up. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2099.84s)]
*  I want to get done with the conversation like, oh, dude, you know, who would really help me out with this? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2101.0s)]
*  Exactly who I'm talking about. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2105.6s)]
*  It's fucking brutal. It's tough. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2107.52s)]
*  That was kind of the worst part sometimes was just hitting that type of moment. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2109.84s)]
*  We're like, oh, man, because it's hard to kind of have good friends, you know. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2113.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Do you still have pals from growing up? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2116.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Some good pals from growing up. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  So and then I've made more over the years, kind of like people go through things. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2120.92s)]
*  A lot of friends get married and stuff. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2124.76s)]
*  And since I'm not married, you kind of fall into this weird place [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2126.1200000000003s)]
*  where you just become like you're just friends with whoever's not married. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2128.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of fucked up. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2132.8s)]
*  Yeah. When does that start happening? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2134.32s)]
*  I would say probably in your 30s, it starts getting more like [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2136.84s)]
*  well, I guess it depends on where you're from. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2139.64s)]
*  Like where I'm from, Louisiana, people get married early. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2141.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2143.2s)]
*  And so you lose a couple of guys right out of the gate [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2144.12s)]
*  and right after they get married, their hair falls out immediately. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2146.48s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2148.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, at least they locked it in beforehand. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2149.8399999999997s)]
*  That's true. Yeah. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2151.48s)]
*  And maybe some of those guys know their hair is about to fall out. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2152.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they have an idea. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2155.64s)]
*  They're like, oh, I'm going to lock it in. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2157.2s)]
*  I'm going to get that. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2158.7999999999997s)]
*  Their bald dad is just having a conversation with them. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2159.92s)]
*  Hey, buddy, it's time to get that ring and put the knee down. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2162.6s)]
*  Like, Dad, I'm only 15. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2167.2s)]
*  No, they always had that one kid that went bald way early, you know, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2168.76s)]
*  and people would use him to buy alcohol. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2172.0400000000004s)]
*  They're like, what do you mean? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2173.4s)]
*  He can't buy liquor and be like, he's only told you like he's bald. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2174.5200000000004s)]
*  He just took out his 401k. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2179.1200000000003s)]
*  He's fine. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2181.1600000000003s)]
*  That's Roger. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2183.0s)]
*  He rode here on his bicycle. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2184.32s)]
*  You think a fucking child is bald, damn it. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2186.4s)]
*  He's a DUI. He already bought the boost. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2189.4s)]
*  That's why he's on the bike. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2191.88s)]
*  He's selling the liquor, damn it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2192.84s)]
*  Oh, so, yeah, but I still have good friends from when I was growing up. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2195.52s)]

*  You meet a lot more people probably than you do if you just stay in one [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2207.12s)]
*  and live in one town. Yeah. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2209.72s)]
*  I do think everyone should get out of their town at some point. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2211.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like you don't know what you're missing if you don't. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2214.24s)]

*  So I've got like this Boston accent, but it's sometimes it's on, sometimes it's off. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2368.6800000000003s)]

*  If you don't know who you are, then you're a comedian. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2380.44s)]
*  Then most comedians don't know who they are, because that's why they're putting on a show. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2382.1600000000003s)]

*  They're trying to figure out who they are. Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2387.96s)]
*  They're trying to manage this presentation that they put to the world, you know, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2390.0400000000004s)]
*  I think because like when they were young, maybe whoever they were [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2395.2000000000003s)]
*  didn't feel comfortable or whatever in the world. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2397.68s)]

*  And anyway, that's a little bit meta, I think. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2401.2799999999997s)]
*  But what was the did you ever like there was ever a point in your life [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2404.16s)]

*  No, nothing close to that. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2629.12s)]
*  No. My buddy was made a little bit more, a lot of it more, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2630.4s)]
*  a whole shit ton more. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2634.08s)]

*  Oh, yeah. Got it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2644.08s)]
*  So it's all relative. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2645.2s)]
*  Yeah. And also some of that stuff is as much as it like it's like [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2646.64s)]
*  it's live and learn sometimes. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2651.12s)]

*  You have to go through periods of that. Yeah. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2678.2s)]
*  And even with stand up, you can't escape that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2680.0s)]
*  It's like you just have to, you know, get it on stage. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2681.7999999999997s)]

*  It's like fucking sweating, sweating through my pants. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2775.48s)]
*  I'm like, it's really not as bad as I'm making it out to be. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2778.8s)]
*  Hey, no, but I think, look, there's something about honesty. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2781.7200000000003s)]
*  There's not as much of it in the world. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2787.08s)]
*  I would literally pay to go to a room and watch somebody be honest with themselves [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2788.36s)]
*  about what's going on. I'm learning it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2793.12s)]
*  I think we all pretend to be something until we get the hang of it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2794.96s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I just. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2798.32s)]

*  I just I can't wait for the day. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2812.56s)]
*  I finally get it. You know? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2813.6s)]
*  Yeah. When did it click? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2815.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I think it like about 11 years you start to be like. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2817.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. There's some different moments. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2824.08s)]
*  I mean, thank you. Sweetie, you to say that. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2825.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I definitely feel like I don't have it like this is [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2827.24s)]
*  like it is my job now, you know? Yeah. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2830.4s)]
*  For a long time, I didn't know if it was my job. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2832.56s)]
*  You know, I felt like it was. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2835.04s)]
*  But you keep going home like at Christmas and you don't have a real job. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2836.2400000000002s)]
*  And you know, I'm a comedian like whatever, dude, you know, where's your husband? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2839.2000000000003s)]
*  Because everybody just thinks you're homosexual. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2843.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Do you get on some sort of television or platform? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2845.36s)]
*  Like, oh, he's actually very successful. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2848.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. You should have been rooting him on. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2849.84s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe we'll scratch out these posters that we drew. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2852.96s)]
*  You know, actually, we sign this actually huge. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2856.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a poster that says you're a f***. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2859.84s)]
*  You held up at my show. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2861.92s)]
*  But yeah, I'll sign it. Thanks, guy. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2863.76s)]
*  So, yeah, I think there's like so that kind of stuff gets tricky. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2867.36s)]
*  And then I think there comes a point where it's like [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2871.68s)]
*  you don't have anything else. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2874.2400000000002s)]
*  And so it's like whenever you give up anything else, like there were times [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2875.2000000000003s)]
*  I quit to do real estate. There was times I quit. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2877.92s)]
*  And I f***ed up like the third contract ever did. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2881.04s)]
*  I had to pay somebody's lease for like six months. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2883.36s)]
*  How do you f*** up that bad? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2886.16s)]
*  I can put myself as the guarantor. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2887.68s)]
*  Are you shitting me? That's crazy. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2890.24s)]
*  That just takes one John Hancock to pay six months rent. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2894.08s)]
*  I had to go live with my girlfriend [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2897.04s)]
*  and I'm paying rent for these other motherf***ers. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2899.44s)]
*  I was going through some weird s***. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2905.52s)]
*  Sometimes I would pee in the sink at night in my girlfriend's [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2906.88s)]
*  because I didn't want to pee loud and wake up the family, right? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2909.04s)]
*  Oh, with the family. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2911.44s)]
*  Yeah, with the family. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2912.96s)]
*  And the cat would go in there and like mill around in a sink [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2914.64s)]
*  and f***ing snitch me out the mom, knowing that I was urinating in the sink. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2918.64s)]
*  What's that talk sound like? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2923.52s)]
*  She said it. Your boyfriend been peeing in the sink. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2925.92s)]
*  It's not the first boyfriend that's ever peed in the sink. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2930.3199999999997s)]
*  She's kind of into it. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2932.72s)]
*  The mom's into it. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2934.08s)]
*  I remember her daughter texting me, mom knows. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2935.04s)]
*  But the pissing in the sink? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2938.96s)]
*  Who knows? Whatever, Grace. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2940.56s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2942.16s)]
*  We're all going through it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2942.56s)]
*  I suppose. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2943.52s)]
*  God damn. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2945.2799999999997s)]
*  You got, I mean, you're going to figure it out. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2948.24s)]
*  And I think it's interesting these days, I think because I'll say this, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2950.8799999999997s)]
*  there used to be more of stairways for how people got into comedy, right? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2954.4s)]
*  Obviously you got on stage, but then you got on different like little, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2961.92s)]
*  like there was like a Comedy Central 10 minutes or there was like these, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2964.96s)]
*  now there's like Dry Bar and different groups like that, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2970.0s)]
*  but there was other small groups where you did comedy sets that they put out there, right? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2972.16s)]
*  And now a lot of that's disappearing. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2977.44s)]
*  There was like, what was that? Late show. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2978.96s)]
*  There were some late shows where you would just sit around in a panel, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2982.48s)]
*  Where people would start to build their name. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2987.8399999999997s)]
*  And now I think just a lot of like podcasting has kind of become that. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2990.48s)]
*  It's taken the place of a lot of things. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2993.44s)]
*  That's true, yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2994.96s)]
*  Whereas before there was maybe more acting roles or things like that for comedy [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=2996.0s)]
*  that, because there's not even that many comedies now, like shows. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3001.12s)]
*  Not really, no, not so much. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3005.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that's the new wave that they're trying to do right now is that they're trying to cast for [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3008.72s)]
*  a lot of comedy shows because there has been like a lull. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3013.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3016.24s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3016.48s)]
*  So I think that you have to have some place where you start to build, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3017.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, that's like an entertainment outlet. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3022.16s)]
*  So I think podcasting is that, you know, I think it's just kind of become that. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3024.72s)]
*  Or Tik Tok or some sort of like just, you know, people's own social media. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3028.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3033.28s)]
*  Because sure you have the podcast, but then also the clips are kind of what bring people [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3033.6800000000003s)]
*  into your world a lot of times. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3037.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3038.4s)]
*  That is really true. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3039.5200000000004s)]
*  I also feel like I'm preaching at you, do I? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3040.4s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm listening and I'm taking it all in because I, it looks clearly I need it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3041.84s)]
*  I need all the information that I need. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3046.0800000000004s)]
*  I know it's been a while since you had a man in you, but this ain't it. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3047.84s)]
*  But you don't, don't take any of my ideas. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3052.48s)]
*  No, no, don't take any of my, I'm not trying to give you any advice. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3054.32s)]
*  No, no, no, that was, that was the advice you gave. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3057.36s)]
*  Don't, don't, don't take anyone's advice. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3059.28s)]
*  Was it? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3061.6s)]
*  The other night. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3061.92s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3062.48s)]
*  You said, oh, well, I just fucked that up. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3063.2000000000003s)]
*  Because that's even advice, huh? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3065.76s)]
*  Damn, what an idiot. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3067.1200000000003s)]
*  I guess I haven't podcasted in a while. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3068.08s)]
*  I'm pretty rusty. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3069.76s)]
*  I'm usually, I'm usually good with the banter. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3071.52s)]
*  No, you're always great. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3073.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm usually good with the jokes. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3074.6400000000003s)]
*  I feel like you're doing good. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3076.4s)]
*  Your sister's here. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3077.36s)]
*  Shout out Nora. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3078.88s)]
*  What's up, Nora? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3079.92s)]
*  Nora's here. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3080.4s)]
*  We're trying to figure out, so Nora just graduated from West Virginia University. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3080.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3084.08s)]
*  And we're trying to figure out what we're going to do with her. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3084.7200000000003s)]
*  She needs a job. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3087.04s)]
*  So I'm trying to think of what she can do within the realm of working together. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3087.7599999999998s)]
*  So you have some skill sets, Nora? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3093.12s)]
*  I can edit. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3096.56s)]
*  You can edit. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3097.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3098.4s)]
*  So we're thinking she's going to be doing like the social media side of things. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3098.64s)]
*  Great. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3102.4s)]

*  Are you serious, guys? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3623.76s)]
*  Like the last date I went on, he recorded inside my house. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3625.36s)]
*  So I said, I think I'm good for now. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3628.5600000000004s)]

*  Two weeks later, you're like, let's run it back. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3633.28s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, dude, just lock your camera up, I guess. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3635.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so that was brutal. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3638.6400000000003s)]
*  I got to think of somebody who could have said, well, now that's sad. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3640.1600000000003s)]

*  No, sorry. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3644.0800000000004s)]
*  Another date I went on, I was talking about it on the podcast, keeping it very ambiguous. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3645.0400000000004s)]
*  I didn't want any feelings to get hurt, but he showed up hammered. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3649.36s)]
*  And I thought that he was just wicked drunk and slurring his words. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3653.2s)]
*  Well, it turns out he had a speech impediment. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3657.52s)]
*  And I didn't realize, and I didn't pick up on that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=3660.24s)]

*  Did you know that was coming? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4228.0s)]
*  Was there- [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4229.2s)]
*  They helped on it quick. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4231.36s)]
*  So I- [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4232.4s)]
*  You already separated from your previous podcast before this happened? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4233.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4237.04s)]
*  And so that happened on- [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4237.68s)]
*  I left Barstool on Sunday and then I got the call Monday and we had paper signed by Thursday. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4240.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4246.32s)]
*  So it moved pretty quick, which was kind of crazy. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4246.64s)]
*  And is it a better deal than you had at Barstool? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4249.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4251.52s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4251.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm excited about that. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4252.48s)]
*  You feel good about it? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4253.36s)]
*  I feel good, yeah. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4254.08s)]
*  Except the one thing I'm concerned about is I don't have health insurance anymore [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4254.96s)]
*  and I'm going deaf in my left ear. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4259.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's true, huh? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4260.96s)]
*  So I'm going to have to figure that out. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4261.84s)]
*  And especially if you start taking on a lot of kicks this year, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4263.68s)]
*  you're probably going to need some health insurance, you know? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4266.56s)]
*  I'm going to need a couple of Plan B pills and whatnot. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4269.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, get you a little couple grams of Plan B. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4272.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4275.84s)]
*  I'll buy the bulk. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4276.56s)]
*  I'll get it from Kid Rock. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4278.4s)]
*  Yeah, get it from that ditch on you, dude. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4280.08s)]
*  He'll sell you something, bro. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4282.4s)]
*  I already got that. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4283.92s)]
*  Plan B should do a powder, huh? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4284.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4286.48s)]
*  How great would it be to do a line of Plan B? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4287.04s)]
*  Dude, I would fucking rip that left and right if I had the sex. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4289.04s)]
*  I'd do it. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4292.48s)]
*  I'd be like, bye! [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4293.28s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4295.28s)]
*  I had my first crazy fan bring me a bag of cocaine to my show the other night. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4298.16s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4305.92s)]
*  Yeah, I had a bag of cocaine. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4306.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4307.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was good. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4309.12s)]
*  They know I like to stuff, but they wrote, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4311.12s)]
*  we love you so much on a bag of cocaine, which I thought was hilarious. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4313.92s)]
*  So cool. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4317.92s)]
*  It's just interesting. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4318.72s)]
*  Were you able to use any of it or not? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4319.84s)]
*  I preferred not to just because just circumstantially it was [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4321.76s)]
*  unknown where the origin was from. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4327.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know where it's coming from, for sure. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4329.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4330.08s)]
*  Yeah, dude, my buddy's aunt used to fucking shed that like a hole in her throat or whatever, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4330.96s)]
*  and they used to boof cocaine right down it. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4334.72s)]
*  That's fucking awesome. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4336.24s)]
*  That's sick. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4338.08s)]
*  Rocket that shit. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4338.96s)]
*  I want to get there. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4339.68s)]
*  Right through that little bird. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4340.88s)]
*  You got to be doing something right to get to that point. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4342.56s)]
*  Right through that little birdhouse door she had on her neck hole. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4344.56s)]
*  It's cuckoo. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4347.84s)]
*  Yeah, she had that little birdhouse door. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4348.96s)]
*  What else is going on? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4354.16s)]
*  What else is happening in the news right now? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4354.88s)]
*  We have not confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4360.24s)]
*  and or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented cyber truck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4362.96s)]
*  Well, it could have been a fun time or terrorism. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4367.2s)]
*  Yeah. Dude, the toughest thing about a cyber truck, what do you drive, Grace? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4370.96s)]
*  I don't have a license. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4374.56s)]
*  You don't have your license? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4375.44s)]
*  I live in New York. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4376.08s)]
*  Oh, you don't need it, huh? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4377.12s)]
*  Yeah. I used to have it, but I just let it expire. I used to drive. I used to drive. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4378.16s)]
*  And I had a 2002 Lincoln presidential town car, which is either an elderly person or a pimp. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4383.28s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever seen those bad boys. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4394.16s)]
*  Very prestigious, yeah. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4395.68s)]
*  Yeah, three in the front, three in the back. That was the fucking cruiser. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4396.8s)]
*  We love that thing. It was awesome. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4401.84s)]
*  Whipping that bitch, boy. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4403.4400000000005s)]
*  That thing was classic. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4404.72s)]
*  Whipping work in that bitch, son. That thing's awesome. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4406.0s)]
*  Yeah, it still smells like my dead grandpa. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4409.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4411.6s)]

*  All right, Papa. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4413.28s)]
*  He's in that bitch for good. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4414.96s)]
*  I couldn't wait for him to croak to cop that thing. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4416.16s)]
*  You ever are. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4418.4800000000005s)]
*  Didn't you ever make out on your back seat of that car with any man or anything like that? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4421.92s)]
*  I'm sure you had some dates, huh? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4425.44s)]
*  We had plenty of room for it, but I never did. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4426.719999999999s)]
*  And Nora, you don't coach her on dating or anything? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4434.5599999999995s)]
*  It's hopeless. Well, it's fine. I'm not worried about it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4437.92s)]
*  But it's just been something that's been in your life. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4442.88s)]
*  Now, what if a man came along and he's looking for marries? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4445.36s)]
*  Do you think that that's something you would actually consider, you think? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4447.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, at this point it's starting to be like, well, the older I get [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4449.5199999999995s)]
*  and the bigger reaction that I get when I tell people I've never been in a relationship [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4453.2s)]
*  is when I start to think, yeah, I think the next guy will probably be a forever. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4457.84s)]
*  Might be, huh? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4461.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. He could be a real prick too. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4462.24s)]
*  I gotta lock it down. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4465.04s)]
*  He better be a prince. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4466.08s)]
*  He better be. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4468.16s)]
*  And there's gotta be some, I'm trying to think of like, what's your ideal man? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4469.679999999999s)]
*  Or do you even have that? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4476.16s)]
*  Such a dumb question, isn't it? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4476.88s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4478.24s)]
*  Fuck it. I'll tell this story. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4480.16s)]
*  I had a crush on Shane Gillis for a little bit. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4483.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4485.2s)]

*  I was talking to him and I dropped a sandwich that I was eating and he said, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4492.639999999999s)]
*  are you gonna pick that up? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4496.32s)]
*  And I said, I gotta go. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4497.04s)]

*  You pick it up, white boy. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4501.2s)]
*  That kind of shit. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4502.4s)]
*  Well, I just got really nervous that I wasn't playing it cool at all. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4503.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, it wasn't a stacked tactics. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4506.639999999999s)]

*  But I just kept running into him that month, like a lot. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4512.24s)]
*  And it looked like I was stalking him. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4514.5599999999995s)]
*  And it ended with he hosted Saturday Night Live. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=4516.24s)]

*  It was a good time. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5104.5s)]

*  I like just creating something, right? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5118.74s)]
*  Like, let's see what happens here if we set this thing up this way. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5120.9s)]
*  It's caused some chaos. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5123.7s)]
*  There was that one famous story. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5126.58s)]
*  Who's the famous? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5128.02s)]
*  There was two members of, I think Fleetwood Mac that took LSD. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5128.82s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5135.06s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5135.62s)]
*  The night that Fleetwood Mac lost Peter Green and Danny Kerwin to LSD. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5136.26s)]
*  Yeah, what was this about? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5140.26s)]
*  Oh, they died? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5141.06s)]
*  It's all amid a manic psychedelic party in a commune-like mansion, Green, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5142.5s)]
*  I think it's Peter Green is the guy's name, was drawn down into the basement [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5147.62s)]
*  and arrived out of the other side in tears. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5151.54s)]
*  In the band's eyes, he was distraught, despite Green claiming to have had an [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5154.02s)]
*  extraordinary experience and stating that he played the best guitar of his life down there. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5157.86s)]
*  Another member of the band present that day was Danny Kerwin. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5162.34s)]
*  Fate also besieged him that night. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5166.740000000001s)]
*  Peter Green and Danny Kerwin both went together to that house in Munich. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5168.42s)]
*  Okay, that's where they were after a show. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5171.860000000001s)]
*  Their one-time manager, Clifford Davis, recalls, both of them took acid, as I understand. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5174.42s)]

*  You gotta wait. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5518.42s)]
*  I'm new ski. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5519.06s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5519.86s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5520.5s)]
*  I'm brand new. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5521.3s)]
*  I'm, yeah, I shouldn't have said that. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5521.9400000000005s)]
*  Which is probably why I have nothing to talk about. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5522.82s)]
*  No, you're great to talk to. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5527.22s)]
*  Grace Amalia, I love, I'm glad I've gotten to sit and chat with you. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5529.38s)]
*  If you guys don't know Grace, now you probably do. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5532.74s)]
*  I think you have a good, I think, did we talk about your life enough, do you think? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5535.38s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5539.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5540.58s)]
*  Oh, did you finish college or not? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5542.34s)]
*  No, I dropped out. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5544.1s)]
*  You did? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5545.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5545.46s)]
*  But by the time I dropped out of college, I had a 4.0. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5546.26s)]
*  You did? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5549.14s)]
*  Yeah, I found out what Adderall was. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5549.62s)]
*  Oh, so you were using it. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5551.62s)]
*  So I needed it as it turned out. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5552.58s)]
*  The Irish needed, what are the Irish missing? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5555.46s)]
*  There's always that thing, you know? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5557.22s)]
*  They're missing out on, well, the fathers are missing out on loving their children. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5559.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5564.1s)]
*  They don't know how to express it. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5565.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, they can't, huh? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5567.14s)]
*  Yeah, they can't. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5568.1s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's like- [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5568.58s)]
*  They just get you a fucking Edelman jersey? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5570.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5571.86s)]
*  They just hope that'll equate to love. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5573.22s)]
*  It's good. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5576.26s)]
*  Yeah, why can't they do it? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5576.74s)]
*  Well, sharing a beer in silence, that's also supposed to be love in their eyes. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5578.1s)]
*  Really? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5583.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5583.46s)]
*  Yeah, why do the Irish have that trouble sharing love? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5584.66s)]
*  Maybe, and if people listen, they can hit the hotline too with that, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5587.9400000000005s)]
*  985-664-9503, and that would be great to just, I want to examine that next time we have a solo [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5591.22s)]
*  episode as why the Irish have that trouble expressing their love. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5596.900000000001s)]
*  Do you think that they have it more than other cultures? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5601.62s)]
*  Let's think this to compare. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5606.66s)]
*  The Koreans can't do it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5608.900000000001s)]
*  They can't? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5610.1s)]
*  No, they can't. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5610.900000000001s)]
*  No? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5611.3s)]
*  Tough, is it tough love or is it just no love? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5612.42s)]
*  Well, there's a video, you see that, I think Steve, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5614.900000000001s)]
*  Steve, look up Stevie Weeby, he just put that video of him, Bobby and their mother trying [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5617.54s)]
*  to do Christmas together or something. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5623.14s)]
*  Can you see that if you put it on his Instagram? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5625.46s)]
*  The Koreans, I don't think they can do it. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5628.5s)]
*  Bobby's the Asian representative. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5630.26s)]
*  Bobby is, I want to say he, maybe. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5632.1s)]
*  You like it? [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5635.46s)]
*  I know. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5636.42s)]
*  You like it? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5637.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5638.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5638.9800000000005s)]
*  Late at night and I leave Duke here by himself, he loses his mind. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5640.02s)]
*  Oh, Bobby? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5644.1s)]
*  No, Duke. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5645.54s)]
*  Why do you leave at 3 a.m. and leave at dawn? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5647.94s)]
*  Because you have no snacks here, I got hungry. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5651.62s)]
*  So there she's been drinking. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5654.9s)]
*  No, the studio plan in the morning is not the, you know. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5656.02s)]
*  No, it was six in the morning. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5658.5s)]
*  That's why my mom couldn't sleep. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5659.86s)]
*  She heard me sleep late and didn't wake up. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5662.26s)]
*  So what happened last night was, I went to some snacks, so I went to 7-Eleven, I got a [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5664.1s)]
*  snack. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5671.62s)]
*  I got a cool lunch. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5672.1s)]
*  That's good. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5673.46s)]
*  This is like that game show, like that telephone game or whatever. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5674.0199999999995s)]
*  Can you see where Bobby comes in later or not? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5676.98s)]
*  Is there any, can you help me out? [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5679.06s)]
*  Get further down, further, further. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5680.26s)]
*  Is there any part where Bobby comes in or not? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5682.66s)]
*  No, maybe not. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5684.98s)]
*  The mother is very endearing. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5687.3s)]
*  I would love to meet her. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5688.74s)]
*  She's probably a star that I would like to meet. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5690.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5692.74s)]
*  Who's up there for you? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5693.62s)]
*  Who haven't you met? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5694.9s)]
*  And who, on top of that, who was your favorite thus far? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5695.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5698.9s)]
*  I got to meet Mel Gibson one time and he was very captivating. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5699.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5702.34s)]
*  It's very like you get drawn into him, you know? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5703.46s)]
*  You sit down and shoot the shit with him? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5706.18s)]
*  Yep. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5708.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5709.38s)]
*  Yeah, I did get to one time, which is crazy because Patriot is my favorite movie, probably. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5710.02s)]
*  Was there anything else that we wanted to talk about? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5715.22s)]
*  You have any of our topics, anything you want to look at really quick? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5718.34s)]
*  I'm just trying to think, Grace, before I let you go. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5720.42s)]
*  Oh wait, so your new podcast, tell me about it. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5722.42s)]
*  Okay, so it is going to be coming out in February. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5725.3s)]
*  Everything is completely up in the air right now, trying to figure out what the hell it's going to be. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5729.9400000000005s)]
*  But for the most part, the idea for it is the name is going to be Disgraceful. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5733.38s)]
*  And I'm going to have a guest on every week. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5738.02s)]
*  And for the first 50 to 20 minutes, they're auditioning to be my new co-host because I need a new co-host. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5741.620000000001s)]
*  So that's like the niche there. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5748.18s)]
*  And then after that, hopefully we'll shoot the shit. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5749.620000000001s)]
*  I'll get to practice in a little more and be a little better for that. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5752.740000000001s)]
*  So what are you looking for in your co-host? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5756.660000000001s)]
*  Do you already have a parameters? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5758.1s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5760.1s)]
*  It's all just a gimmick. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5761.06s)]
*  I'm never probably going to have a host. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5763.620000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're not. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5765.700000000001s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5766.660000000001s)]
*  But there is possibility. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5767.780000000001s)]
*  Possibility. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5768.820000000001s)]
*  Like Alex suggested. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5769.860000000001s)]
*  Alex Cooper. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5772.42s)]
*  Alex Cooper suggested that. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5772.9800000000005s)]
*  From Call Her Daddy. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5775.06s)]
*  So I had pitched her my idea for this podcast and she's like, yeah, that's awesome. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5776.5s)]
*  But what if you did a podcast with Blake Griffin? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5780.42s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5782.34s)]
*  So that's the idea that she has for it. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5783.700000000001s)]
*  So we're going to figure out something somewhere in the middle. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5785.94s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5789.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5790.66s)]
*  That was just like a little behind the scenes kind of phone call. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5791.0599999999995s)]
*  So we'll see how it goes. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5794.58s)]
*  Will she have a say in it? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5796.5s)]
*  Will you have a say? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5797.62s)]
*  Will it just be, is it up to you? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5798.5s)]
*  I get a final say. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5799.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5801.0599999999995s)]
*  So I think I'm going to stick to my guns. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5801.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5805.46s)]
*  I think just trust your instincts. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5805.7s)]
*  Whatever your instincts are, I love them. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5807.78s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5810.0199999999995s)]
*  Right back at you. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5810.66s)]
*  They're fun. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBZLJxCdRE&t=5811.54s)]
