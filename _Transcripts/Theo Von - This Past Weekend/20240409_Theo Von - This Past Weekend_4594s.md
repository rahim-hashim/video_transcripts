*  We're all singing. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=879.9s)]
*  I can still hear mama praying. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=880.9s)]
*  Somebody stood up and was like, he was a good man. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=881.9s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=888.34s)]
*  I think that was somebody trying to flirt with your wife. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=890.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=892.22s)]
*  That might have been Sabah, your buddy. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=893.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=895.22s)]
*  The demon. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=896.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=897.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=898.22s)]
*  Could have been the demon. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=899.22s)]
*  He definitely, he loves to meet a lady. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=900.22s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=902.02s)]
*  You know what? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=903.02s)]
*  Taking that last loss, what really switched my mindset, man, is I know who I am. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=904.02s)]
*  Like losing, you find out who you are and losing sucks. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=910.22s)]
*  But in those moments, like when you're down, it's a great time to experience you, you know, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=913.22s)]
*  because like when you're winning, you can get this momentum when things, everything's [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=916.86s)]
*  going good. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=919.3399999999999s)]
*  You can kind of get in that groove where you're just on cruise control, you know. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=920.3399999999999s)]
*  But when you lose and the phone stops ringing and you're at home laying in bed going to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=923.9399999999999s)]
*  sleep by yourself and everything, the dust settles, you know, that's when you experience [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=927.5s)]
*  yourself who you really are, you know. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=931.5s)]
*  And I think that's important. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=933.38s)]
*  You know. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=934.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=935.38s)]
*  Was that tough? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=936.38s)]
*  Did you like, what are you? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=937.38s)]
*  Because that's, yeah, that's scary because every moment of silence thing, you kind of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=938.38s)]
*  like, if something like that happens to me, like I have something that's not good or feels [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=941.06s)]
*  like it's not good. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=945.66s)]
*  And I think that's the outcome that I want. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=947.54s)]
*  Any silence I hear after that, I always just, it feels like, yeah, that nothing's like, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=948.54s)]
*  it feels like the phone isn't ringing. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=956.06s)]
*  But even it's just silence. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=957.3s)]
*  It's just normal silence. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=958.3s)]
*  But in my head, I feel like, oh, the phone ain't ringing, you know. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=959.66s)]
*  That's when reality really sets in, you know, like when you're around a bunch of people [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=962.98s)]
*  after a loss and you're talking and everybody's, you know, keeping you busy, your mind's busy, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=966.14s)]
*  but then you go back to your house and you're by yourself, you know, and you look in the [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=970.66s)]
*  mirror and it's just you. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=973.9399999999999s)]
*  Like that's when it's real. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=975.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=977.38s)]
*  That's when the phone's not ringing. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=978.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=979.38s)]
*  What, yeah, how rough did it get? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=980.38s)]
*  Like was there a moment where you're like, okay, I got to get some help. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=983.26s)]
*  Like what did you kind of help did you get? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=986.14s)]
*  I started doing therapy. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=987.98s)]
*  I went to speak to a therapist. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=988.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=990.78s)]
*  There was some nights where I would just, I just got up and left my house. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=991.78s)]
*  Like I just, I couldn't be here. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=995.42s)]
*  I just got up and left my house and went to get a hotel room, you know, got in my truck [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=996.54s)]
*  and just left, you know, and I don't know why. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1000.5s)]
*  I don't have any reason why. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1002.86s)]
*  I just felt like I had to. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1003.86s)]
*  It was crazy, man. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1004.86s)]
*  I was going through it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1006.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1007.1800000000001s)]

*  Do you think, or do you have, like, do you have any perspective on like what it was kind [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1016.54s)]
*  of, or do you think it was just? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1019.5s)]
*  I mean, it could have been all of that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1020.9s)]
*  You know, I definitely have head trauma, have 50 fights and, uh, yeah. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1023.58s)]

*  You know, I just wasn't in a good spot, but I'm good now. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1042.5s)]
*  That's what matters. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1044.54s)]
*  You know, and what about medication or something? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1045.54s)]
*  Like I take, I was off antidepressants for a while because I was trying to not take them. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1047.5s)]
*  And then I got, I was like, I just can't do this right now. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1052.16s)]
*  Life's too much. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1056.34s)]

*  I guess I'm back on right now. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1058.34s)]
*  But did you have, did you ever try any medication or is that something that a lot of UFC fighters [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1061.42s)]
*  do or what is that like? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1066.42s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1068.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, like the prep, we're such tough guys fighting. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't really talk about that in the locker room or in the gym. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1072.1000000000001s)]
*  We don't talk about like, I'm feeling down. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1074.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just shut the hell up and work. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1075.9s)]
*  You know, we got work to do. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1077.54s)]
*  You got to fight to win. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1078.54s)]
*  We don't, we don't sit around and hold hands and talk about, I'm not feeling well today. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1079.54s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1082.74s)]
*  That's your point. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1083.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1084.74s)]
*  It would be nice if we opened up and kind of, cause I'm sure a lot of people are going [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1085.74s)]
*  through it and not talking about it, but I've never been like shied away from telling people [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1088.5s)]
*  how I feel and stuff like that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1092.5s)]
*  So I don't care. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1093.7s)]
*  I will talk about it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1094.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1095.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1096.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1097.7s)]
*  I feel like you try to share when you can about what's going on. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1098.7s)]
*  And I think that's one thing that's so interesting about kind of what the past like year of your [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1100.8400000000001s)]
*  life has been like, is that you were in a space where things were so tough and you were [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1106.54s)]
*  having a tough time and then you get a victory and some of that goes away, but some of it [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1111.74s)]
*  may still stick around. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1118.26s)]
*  So then you get some better perspective as to what that's like, you know? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1119.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1122.1399999999999s)]
*  It's just the highs and lows. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1123.1399999999999s)]
*  Like losing is the lowest of the low. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1124.1399999999999s)]
*  Then you win on pay-per-view, knock a guy out and you're back on the mountain top. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1125.1399999999999s)]
*  It's just what a roller coaster this is fighting, you know? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1128.4599999999998s)]

*  I'm thankful for it all though. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1133.02s)]
*  You know, it's giving me every, giving me my family, everything we have. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1134.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1135.02s)]
*  So I'm thankful for it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1136.02s)]
*  The good and the bad, but I wouldn't recommend anybody seek this as a career. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1137.02s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1141.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1148.26s)]
*  Maybe that's the movie you could be in, man. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1149.26s)]
*  It'll be like, yeah, Madea Goes to the Swamp or something. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1150.26s)]
*  I'm trying to think of a good, since Gyllenhaal and Conor had a movie, what would be a good [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1153.3799999999999s)]
*  Poirier movie? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1156.78s)]
*  Fried green cauliflower ears, maybe? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1159.86s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1162.3s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1164.98s)]
*  Dustin Goes to Tenth Grade. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1166.26s)]
*  We could do that. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1167.8s)]
*  We could just do a movie about me trying to get my GED. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1171.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1174.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1176.8200000000002s)]
*  There's some scenes where it's like you hear a choir just, I can still hear mama praying. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1177.8200000000002s)]
*  I can do it, man. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1184.1000000000001s)]
*  That'd be awesome. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1185.7s)]
*  I can get one. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1186.7s)]
*  Who would play you in a movie, I wonder? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1187.7s)]
*  You ever think about that? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1189.7s)]
*  Because Dustin- [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1191.02s)]
*  I like Jean-Claude Van Damme. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1192.02s)]
*  Does that shoot too high? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1193.02s)]
*  No, I just think, I don't know if he can do the stuff you can, I think he's getting older. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1196.18s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1201.8200000000002s)]
*  But I'm a prime, like Bloodsport John, Jean-Claude Van Damme. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1202.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that would be sick. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1206.78s)]
*  Because one day they could make a movie about you. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1207.78s)]
*  You know, I mean it could be like- [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1210.06s)]
*  If I get this fucking gold belt, we're going to have to make a movie. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1211.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1215.78s)]
*  I remember coming over your house when you had the belt. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1216.78s)]
*  Does it ever feel like you didn't have it? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1219.8999999999999s)]
*  Because there's so many, like, because you're still interim champion. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1221.5s)]
*  It's not like champion's not in it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1227.62s)]
*  And I beat a current champion at the time, who was the title holder when we fought. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1231.5s)]
*  It's just, I feel like it was a world championship. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1235.98s)]
*  But people's opinions, you know, is what it is. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1239.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1242.94s)]
*  Now that you have like a win and you've had, and it's a good place and it takes, like, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1243.94s)]
*  silences some of that self-critic in our head and some of that even fictional critique [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1251.54s)]
*  from other people that some of it may be there and some of it may not. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1256.3000000000002s)]
*  Do you want to, do you feel like, do I want to risk that again? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1261.78s)]
*  Like, do you think about that at all? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1265.5s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1266.98s)]
*  Like, where am I at if it doesn't go my way, which is likely, you know, it's fighting. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1267.98s)]
*  I think I can, I know I can beat anybody in the world. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1273.8999999999999s)]
*  I believe in my skills. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1275.82s)]
*  But the margin for error out there is one mistake you wake up asking what happened, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1277.78s)]
*  you know? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1281.98s)]
*  You think you're going to the school bus stop, you know, you wake up like, I'm late for school. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1283.06s)]
*  No. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1287.54s)]
*  No, you dropped out. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1288.54s)]
*  Sorry, that's too many Dustin's Not in School jokes. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1290.98s)]
*  But no, that's, that's one of the, some of the best stuff about your story is that you [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1293.98s)]
*  didn't even finish high school. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1299.8999999999999s)]
*  Never finished ninth grade. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1301.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1302.78s)]

*  Yeah, man. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1304.78s)]
*  I always, I love you and your wife's story, man. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1305.78s)]
*  It's all, all of it's so hilarious to me, dude. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1308.06s)]
*  There's so many funny moments you guys have been through together over the years. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1310.98s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1313.62s)]
*  I mean, been together a long time, been living together since we were 18. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1314.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she was there for the whole fighting journey and it's been fun, man. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1318.5s)]
*  I don't think I've said this before, but I don't think I would be as successful a fighter [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1323.1399999999999s)]
*  without her. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1326.78s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1329.78s)]
*  Because even like this last loss, like she, I put her through so much stuff after that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1330.78s)]
*  loss and she was still there for me, you know, every day right by my side, like telling me [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1332.7s)]

*  For sure. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1343.58s)]
*  And when I was younger, dude, like I would have been cutting up, running the streets, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1344.58s)]
*  you know, but I had a mortgage and a wife at home. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1348.54s)]
*  So I was home every night and at the gym the next day. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1350.46s)]
*  So that, you know, right. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1352.58s)]

*  You used to fight people at the police station out here because it would be. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1409.18s)]
*  So yeah, I have fought somebody in the yard or the grass of the police station. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1413.74s)]
*  My place I had when I was 17 was directly across from Lafayette Police Department. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1418.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1422.6200000000001s)]

*  My brother was playing his guitar there or something and a guy I was with, I didn't really [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1428.32s)]
*  know him well. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1432.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1434.46s)]
*  And we were in somebody's purse at the bar and then he got caught and called out for [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1435.94s)]
*  it and we were with him and I'm like, oh, I mean, then we started walking back to my [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1438.94s)]
*  house and we just got into it and fought. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1442.14s)]

*  Was it fun? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1446.26s)]
*  Like those street fights? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1447.26s)]
*  Is that kind of more fun or you like having a referee in there? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1448.26s)]
*  Not rather a referee. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1452.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1453.7s)]
*  Especially nowadays, man. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1454.7s)]
*  People are shooting and stabbing. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1455.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's not fair. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1456.7s)]
*  No. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1458.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1459.7s)]
*  You're in a space now where you can run it back, man. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1460.94s)]
*  You can feel like you can do it again. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1466.54s)]
*  If you wanted to, you could retire on a high note. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1470.54s)]
*  People can retire whenever they want. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1472.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1473.74s)]
*  When I was 18, bro, I told my wife, we made an agreement. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1474.74s)]
*  I wouldn't fight past 35. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1477.18s)]
*  And at 18, I had no idea what 35 looked like. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1478.18s)]
*  But now I'm 35, I'm like, oh shit, it's here. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1481.04s)]
*  I still feel good. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1482.82s)]
*  I don't want to stop. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1483.82s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1484.82s)]
*  I still feel good. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1485.82s)]
*  And I compete with these young guys. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1486.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1488.22s)]
*  I'm still in the gym. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1489.22s)]
*  I got bumps and bruises I carry from so many years of fighting. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1490.22s)]
*  I had a couple of surgeries, but I feel good. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1493.22s)]
*  So what do you think? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1496.1000000000001s)]
*  What does it look like for you? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1497.1000000000001s)]
*  Like, are they pushing you? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1498.1000000000001s)]
*  I know you talked about fighting Hamzat. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1499.1000000000001s)]
*  Islam. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1502.1000000000001s)]
*  Islam. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1503.1000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's going to, like, what do you think is going to happen? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1504.1000000000001s)]
*  We'll see, man. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1509.78s)]
*  I think this next pay-per-view, UFC 300, is going to have... [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1510.78s)]
*  Might be an announcement? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1513.78s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1515.78s)]
*  It's in two weeks. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1517.14s)]
*  Max Holloway's fighting Gagey. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1518.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm going to go to it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1519.14s)]
*  Are you going? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1520.14s)]
*  Nah, nah. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1521.14s)]
*  I'm doing a viewing party in Connecticut. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1522.14s)]
*  Oh, okay, great. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1523.14s)]
*  Where's that at? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1524.42s)]
*  Just so people can come check you out. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1525.42s)]
*  At the Mohegan Sun. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1526.42s)]
*  Gang, gang. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1527.42s)]
*  At the Mohegan Sun. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1528.42s)]
*  But there's two huge title fights on that card. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1529.66s)]
*  I mean, not title fights, two huge lightweight fights. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1531.7800000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, this could have a lot to do with you guys. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1533.7800000000002s)]
*  Harmon versus Charles, and then Gagey versus Holloway. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1535.5s)]
*  So that's some big fights in the division. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1539.14s)]
*  We'll see what happens after that. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1540.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1542.94s)]
*  Yeah, because... [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1543.94s)]
*  But I've fought three of those four guys already, and two of them I fought twice. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1545.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1550.74s)]
*  I know, huh? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1551.74s)]
*  Yeah, I fought Max twice, I fought Justin twice, and I fought Charles once. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1552.74s)]
*  Do you have... [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1558.54s)]
*  What kind of outcome would you prefer, do you think? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1559.54s)]
*  I don't really have a... [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1563.26s)]
*  I think people are kind of looking past Max a little bit. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1564.26s)]
*  I think Max can beat Justin. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1568.14s)]
*  Of course, Justin could win, but Max is tough, his rhythm, his range, and his technique on [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1569.6200000000001s)]
*  the feet. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1574.78s)]
*  Unless Justin wrestles a little bit, I think Max can pick him apart and stay on the outside, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1575.78s)]
*  but that's what makes fighting so fun. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1578.98s)]
*  We don't know until we watch it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1580.3s)]
*  And Charles and Harmon, that can go either way. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1583.78s)]
*  Both great grapplers. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1586.26s)]
*  I would think Charles would have an advantage standing up, but we got to see. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1587.46s)]
*  Yeah, because now if Max went... [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1592.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just wondering, where do you... [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1597.3799999999999s)]
*  Because I got two wins over Max. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1599.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1600.98s)]
*  My last loss was to Justin. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1602.34s)]
*  If Max beats him, does he stay at 55, or does he go back to 45? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1603.6200000000001s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1609.5s)]
*  If you think, do you feel like you have a certain amount of fights left in you, what [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1610.5s)]
*  is that yet? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1614.54s)]
*  Does it start to feel like, that's an interesting thought. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1615.54s)]
*  Do you start to feel like, oh, I think I might have one or two left in there? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1618.5s)]
*  Or do you think you would get a definite feeling from yourself when you're like... [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1623.6200000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1627.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1628.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1629.66s)]
*  I don't even put a number on it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1630.66s)]
*  I feel like the last one, how I feel in the warmup room, how I feel walking through the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1632.3400000000001s)]
*  tunnel, walking into the crowd, getting into the octagon, how I feel then, I felt good. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1634.46s)]
*  I felt like it wasn't time to stop. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1639.14s)]
*  Maybe next time, if I feel like that again, then it's not time to stop. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1641.94s)]
*  I don't want to put a number, I just put it on the way I feel. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1644.94s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by PrizePix. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1649.02s)]
*  Do you love firing on sports like I do? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1651.66s)]
*  Well, PrizePix is the best daily fantasy sports app for you. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1655.7s)]
*  You can fire on all your favorite sports like the NBA, NCAA, UFC, and many more. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1660.54s)]
*  Instead of choosing teams, you choose individual players. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1667.02s)]
*  That's what I like about PrizePix is that it's innovative. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1669.94s)]
*  It's not the same team spread situation. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1672.76s)]
*  It's something new. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1675.6s)]
*  Each player that you choose has a set projection and you pick either more or less than the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1677.22s)]
*  set projection. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1682.98s)]
*  So if you think Zion Williamson is going to have less than 24 points, you can choose that. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1685.14s)]
*  If you think Marjan Beauchamp, my boy is going to have more than seven rebounds, you can [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1690.8600000000001s)]
*  choose that. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1696.46s)]
*  If you are smart with sports and you know what players are going to perform on what [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1697.5600000000002s)]
*  nights, PrizePix is the best app for you. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1701.18s)]
*  Download the app and use code Theo. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1705.38s)]

*  PrizePix. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1712.7s)]
*  Have you ever tried to break a bad habit? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1714.34s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1716.8999999999999s)]
*  Hell, I've spent years trying to break my biggest vice. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1717.8999999999999s)]
*  We've all been there. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1722.3799999999999s)]
*  Thankfully, there's a breath of fresh air, fume. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1723.82s)]
*  It's not about giving up. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1727.94s)]
*  It's about switching up. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1729.68s)]
*  Fume takes your habit and simply makes it better, healthier, and a whole lot more enjoyable. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1732.02s)]
*  Instead of vapor, fume uses flavored air. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1738.5s)]
*  Instead of electronics, fume is completely natural. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1742.0s)]
*  And instead of harmful chemicals, fume uses delicious flavors. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1746.12s)]
*  You get it. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1751.24s)]
*  Instead of bad, fume is good. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1752.24s)]
*  I'll say this, when you're using fume, it definitely occupies those craving moments. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1754.64s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1762.86s)]
*  I want to tell you, you can start your year off right still, even though it's spring, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1764.04s)]
*  with the good habit by going to tryfume.com slash theo. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1769.24s)]
*  That's t-r-y-f-u-m dot com slash t-h-e-o and getting the journey pack today. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1775.24s)]
*  Fume is giving listeners of the show 10% off when they use my code theo to help make starting [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1783.1200000000001s)]
*  the good habit that much easier. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1788.28s)]
*  How was it like? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1792.68s)]
*  What was it like to get... [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1794.36s)]
*  Thanks for talking about it with me too, man. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1796.02s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1797.4s)]
*  What was it like to get... [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1798.5600000000002s)]
*  Because if you were going through some of your toughest times after the Gachie fight, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1800.68s)]
*  before the BSD fight, what was it that made you able to stay in, get ready for that next [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1806.92s)]
*  fight? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1815.68s)]
*  Because that's a space where I honestly think a lot of people can relate to in their lives. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1816.68s)]
*  Like, God, I don't feel great right here. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1820.8000000000002s)]
*  There's something in my life that's not perfect or that's not the way I wish it to be. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1828.12s)]
*  That's not my will, you know? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1832.4s)]
*  And how to get ready then for something still that's important. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1834.24s)]
*  Like we were talking about earlier, I think just having a name, having a date to circle [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1838.64s)]
*  on my calendar kind of put me in the right direction mentally. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1842.68s)]
*  Like I knew I had something to work towards. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1846.6s)]
*  It was a big challenge. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1847.6s)]
*  It's a fight. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1848.6s)]
*  It's what I've been doing my whole life. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1849.6s)]
*  Like that kind of put me back on the track where I needed to be. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1850.6s)]
*  Practicing mindfulness and speaking to therapy and talking to my wife and stuff like that [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1854.84s)]
*  was helping along the way. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1858.8799999999999s)]
*  But whenever I got the name and the date for this next fight, everything kind of clicked [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  into, all right, this is what I need to be doing. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1863.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1865.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1866.6399999999999s)]
*  It really drowned it out. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1867.6399999999999s)]
*  All the idleness of sitting at home or overthinking. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, I had such a big challenge in front of me that that's all I focused on. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1872.04s)]
*  Everything else like blinders. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1875.32s)]
*  That's how fighting is for me. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1876.84s)]
*  Is that part of the reasons why you also took that fight you think? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1878.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1882.68s)]
*  You're like, I need a goal right now. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1883.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1884.84s)]
*  I was in the spot. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1885.84s)]
*  It just happened. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1886.84s)]
*  They called where I was in the spot of my life. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1887.84s)]
*  Like, and mentally in a place where whatever name they called with, I would say, yes, I [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1888.84s)]
*  just needed to challenge, you know, because I needed to be at war with something else [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1893.36s)]
*  besides myself because I was fighting myself every day. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1896.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1898.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1899.64s)]
*  Man, that's fascinating. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1900.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1901.64s)]
*  So many times I'll sit around like fighting myself instead of picking up, like putting [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1902.64s)]
*  something on the calendar that is something I could be a goal. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1906.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1910.48s)]
*  Something I could try and conquer a challenge. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1911.72s)]
*  Man. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1914.04s)]
*  If I'm not, if I'm not at war with something, I'm at war with myself. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1915.04s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1918.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1919.04s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1920.04s)]
*  And sometimes I don't even realize it. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1921.04s)]
*  I'm sitting there, I'm pitching and hitting against, but I don't even know what's going [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1922.76s)]
*  on. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1926.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1927.1200000000001s)]
*  And definitely down on the judge's scorecards. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1928.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1929.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1930.68s)]
*  I'm not winning the decision. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1931.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1932.68s)]
*  Well, I'll be the judge, dude. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1933.68s)]
*  And I'll be giving myself shitty. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1936.4s)]
*  I'll be the judge and the jury. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1938.4s)]
*  I'm like, this guy sucks. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1941.2800000000002s)]
*  He's guilty. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1943.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1944.2800000000002s)]
*  Guilty, man. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1945.2800000000002s)]
*  God, that's the same way I am, man. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1946.2800000000002s)]
*  But it's good too, because that mindset and having that work problem, if you focus it [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1949.4s)]
*  on something, you could really go far. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1954.7600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1956.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1957.72s)]
*  It's that same. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1958.72s)]
*  It's a gift that occurs. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1959.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1960.72s)]
*  But recognize it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1961.72s)]
*  Having some ability to see it is also a gift, because when you're just in it and you're [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1962.72s)]
*  all that and you just keep doing it, you're reactive only, that's when it feels like it [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1967.48s)]
*  can feel catastrophic sometimes. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1972.68s)]
*  But then also it can feel that's the same stuff that just gives you unending motivation. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1976.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1980.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1981.16s)]
*  So do you know for yourself? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1982.16s)]
*  Do you have a fight that you want or you don't know yet? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1984.64s)]
*  I want to fight for the belt. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1986.64s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1988.0s)]
*  That's the last thing I have to do in this sport is be the Undisputed World Champion. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1989.0s)]
*  After I do that, anything you can do in the sport, I've done. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1992.3600000000001s)]
*  I have 30 fights in the UFC. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1996.24s)]
*  Been fighting a long time before the UFC. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=1998.1999999999998s)]
*  That's the last thing I have to do. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2000.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2001.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2002.9599999999998s)]
*  But also I don't want to attach myself to it too much to where if it doesn't happen [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2003.9599999999998s)]
*  or if I never get another title shot, I judge my life's work on that. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2007.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't want to leave it like that. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2013.3999999999999s)]
*  So I'm just really practicing trying to be content in the place and space that I'm in. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2014.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2018.84s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2019.84s)]
*  I felt like when you won that fight, it's interesting how much. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2020.84s)]
*  I was in that bar. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2025.24s)]
*  Me and my comedian friend Amir, we were in this bar in Australia. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2027.16s)]
*  We're watching. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2031.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2032.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2033.76s)]
*  And I'm holding onto some guy and they don't even know. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2034.76s)]
*  Everybody's just, people were on their edge of their seat. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2035.76s)]
*  There was some guy left his wife right there in it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2038.0s)]
*  People were lot, there was just so much going on, man. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2042.2s)]
*  But it felt like, you almost felt the whole planet. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2046.02s)]
*  It felt like take an exhale. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2049.82s)]
*  It felt like things were possible. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2053.56s)]
*  That's what was craziest about it. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2055.96s)]
*  I think, and somebody had a great tweet. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2057.12s)]
*  It was like Dustin for humanity. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2060.12s)]
*  And I was like, man, that's exactly how it felt. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2063.2999999999997s)]
*  It was like the underdog came through again, man. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2067.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2069.92s)]
*  I think it made everybody just feel like, oh, there's still things that can happen in [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2070.92s)]
*  the world that like a guy stands a fighting chance for sure. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2076.24s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2081.12s)]
*  I'm missed a bounce back every time I take an L, I come back. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2083.12s)]
*  Yeah, I come back and it's a challenge to myself every time because I've never lost [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2085.96s)]
*  two fights in a row getting knocked out by Gagey jumping right back in camp, you know, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2089.68s)]
*  unsure of the future. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2093.96s)]
*  What if I, you know, I was in a bad place. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2094.96s)]
*  What if I lose this fight? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2096.56s)]
*  Where am I going to be at then? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2098.0s)]
*  You know, but to get my hand raised and put on a performance like that is just like, fuck [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2099.52s)]
*  man, hardwood pays off. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2104.92s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that strut after what did Trump say to you after the fight? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2106.4s)]
*  I was, I couldn't hear what he was saying. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2110.88s)]
*  I was talking to Dana and then I was somebody sitting next to Dana was telling me they bet [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2112.96s)]
*  like 200K on me or something like that. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2115.8s)]
*  And I was trying to get my 20% from her. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2117.6400000000003s)]
*  That's what I was talking about. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2119.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2120.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2121.6s)]
*  You're just walking around collecting like, hey, always be closing. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2122.6s)]
*  The work is done. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2126.56s)]
*  We got to collect. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2127.56s)]
*  It looks like I'm talking to Trump, but I'm talking to somebody, Dana and somebody sitting [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2128.56s)]
*  next to him. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2131.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2132.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  You're doing good. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2134.6800000000003s)]
*  You're great. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2135.6800000000003s)]
*  You're phenomenal. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2136.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's unbelievable, man. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2139.04s)]
*  God. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2143.2799999999997s)]
*  What is that? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  How soon do you, after you say you end up knocking someone out, what's the appropriate [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2145.36s)]
*  amount of time before you have to go over there and check on them? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2149.56s)]
*  Well, I guess everyone's different, but he was kind of sitting down for a while. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2152.52s)]
*  So, and the ref was waiting for us to get in the middle. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2156.56s)]
*  So I kind of helped him walk to the middle, talk to him a little bit. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2158.68s)]
*  It just depends how bad it is and how much they're moving, you know? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2161.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2165.52s)]
*  You never know. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2166.52s)]
*  It's so wild. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2167.52s)]
*  Yeah, because I guess, can you kind of tell how, because you haven't been knocked out [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2169.12s)]
*  or gotten knocked unconscious, you know what it's like. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2177.64s)]
*  I mean, you guys have that throughout your careers. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2180.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2182.68s)]
*  Because nobody's around to knock out as much as you guys. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2183.68s)]
*  Do you start to gauge how well a guy is after a kind of thing? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2186.24s)]
*  See, like, I've been in the corner of so many guys who have been knocked out and I've been [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2189.4s)]
*  around fights for so long. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2194.56s)]
*  I kind of see when people go back to the locker room and they don't even remember what happened. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2196.16s)]
*  They keep asking the same questions over and over again. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2200.36s)]
*  Like, that's when you know it's serious. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2202.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2204.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2205.48s)]
*  So I didn't see, I didn't go to his locker room and speak to him after. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2206.48s)]
*  So I don't know where he was, but he seemed like he shook back pretty quick in there. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2208.36s)]
*  He was talking pretty clear. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2211.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2212.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2213.44s)]
*  Has Dana and Sean, have they offered you a title match yet? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2214.44s)]
*  No. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2218.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2219.04s)]
*  No. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2220.04s)]
*  I don't know what's next, but I think we're going to hear soon. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2221.04s)]
*  You think that? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2224.08s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2225.08s)]
*  Oh, that seems interesting. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2226.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2227.08s)]
*  News alert. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2228.08s)]
*  Breaking news. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2229.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2231.08s)]
*  What about boxing? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2233.48s)]
*  You see this stuff, like, do you start to think as you get further in your career that [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2234.48s)]
*  there's a lot of people fighting, going to boxing? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2240.12s)]
*  Tyson Pedro just went to boxing. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2244.4s)]
*  Did he? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2246.16s)]
*  Yep. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2247.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2248.16s)]
*  He just started, there's guys who go like, that'll fight like in the Jake Paul, you know, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2249.16s)]
*  in that world. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2255.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2256.44s)]
*  Do you see yourself ever doing something like that? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2257.44s)]
*  Would you ever count something like that out or? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2258.44s)]
*  I just, I'm 35 and I have, you know, I think five fights, six fights left on my current [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2259.44s)]
*  contract with UFC. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2265.88s)]
*  I don't know if I'm ever going to fight that out. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2267.48s)]
*  You know, am I going to fight six more times and become a free agent? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2269.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't, I don't know, but I would love to box. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2271.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2273.92s)]
*  So even if you were to go to boxing, do you have, does that UFC have to have a part in [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2274.92s)]
*  that fight? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2278.5200000000004s)]
*  If I'm, well, if you're still in the contract, if I fight whatever's left on my contract [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2279.5200000000004s)]
*  and I'm free agent, that can do whatever I want. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2283.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2285.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2286.7200000000003s)]
*  But if not, and there's not like an equal parting, then even if you were to go do boxing, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2287.7200000000003s)]
*  like Tyron Woodley went and boxed. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2291.96s)]
*  He was, he was out of his contract. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2293.96s)]
*  Oh, he was out of his contract. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2295.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2296.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the only person who's ever done that is Connor where UFC was co-promoted it and [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2297.2400000000002s)]
*  got a cut of it. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2299.92s)]
*  But it was such, it was, yeah, against Mayweather, but it was such a big fight. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2300.92s)]
*  Everybody won. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2304.32s)]
*  You know, that, that makes sense. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2305.32s)]
*  Other than that, I don't think the UFC would like let anybody do that. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2306.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2309.52s)]
*  Cause it would open up a can of worms. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2310.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2311.7599999999998s)]
*  And he's built the UFC, the brands is so strong now. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2312.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know if they want to give any other brands the rub by co-promoting and stuff like [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2314.7599999999998s)]
*  that. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2318.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2319.28s)]
*  And we fight mixed martial arts, you know, boxing is a part of mixed martial arts, but [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2320.28s)]
*  it's a whole different thing, man. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2324.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you think it would be something like when you think about that, is it something that's [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2326.44s)]
*  kind of interesting or do you feel like, uh, I just like mixed martial arts because you're [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2329.32s)]
*  great on your, you know, you're a good fighter, you know, you're a good fighter, you're a [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2334.68s)]
*  good fighter. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2337.68s)]
*  I just like mixed martial arts because you're great on your, you know, one of your, like [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2338.8399999999997s)]
*  even with BSD or BDS, I can't remember, but he, um, BSD, BSD, he, it felt like he didn't, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2343.0s)]
*  they didn't want to have you on the feet that month. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2351.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, it felt like it, it wasn't a preference of his, just watching. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2353.44s)]
*  And every time we went to the ground, I took myself down. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2358.68s)]
*  I never got taken down once by him. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2361.44s)]
*  I was jumping guillotines, you know, ended up on my back. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2362.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2365.16s)]
*  I never got taken out, but we, we worked wrestling really hard that camp. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2366.16s)]
*  We thought he was going to be diving for my legs, you know, he just seemed a little bit [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2368.72s)]
*  slow on the feet. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2371.24s)]
*  And, uh, you know, if you stand in front of me, he didn't have great head movement in [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2372.24s)]
*  his fights. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2376.04s)]
*  The videos we watched, if you stand in front of me, like, I'm going to get you, you know, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2377.04s)]
*  something's going to land. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  That's going to hurt you, especially over five rounds. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2381.7999999999997s)]
*  That's why I asked the UFC for it to be 25 minute fight. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2383.64s)]
*  I didn't want to do three rounds because if this guy pushes me against the fence and I [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2385.56s)]
*  lose one round, you know, like I think the better fighter wins over the long run. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2389.9199999999996s)]
*  So I asked them for five rounds and they gave it to us. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2394.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2398.32s)]
*  What is that? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2399.32s)]
*  What are those moments like when you're just up against the fence and it just feels like, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2400.32s)]
*  it feels like two neighbors kind of just like, are like having an issue about something. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2405.2400000000002s)]
*  Bro fighting is like when you're not touching each other, like when you're squared off, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2410.76s)]
*  like feigning and throwing punches, that's just like, it's, it's chaotic. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2415.6200000000003s)]
*  But when you get to the fence or you get on the ground and you're kind of, you know, pummeling [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2418.48s)]
*  and stuff like that, that's when like reality sets in where you get like a moment of clarity [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2422.2400000000002s)]
*  like, Oh shit, this is happening. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2425.3s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2426.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, he's not on the fence. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2428.44s)]
*  He's kneeing me. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2429.44s)]
*  But like, you don't think you don't have time to think when you're fighting, like if you're [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2430.44s)]
*  scrambling on the ground or throwing combinations and blocking kicks and firing punches back, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2431.52s)]
*  it's kind of chaotic. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2436.96s)]
*  You're not thinking, you're just reacting. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2437.96s)]
*  But whenever you get to the fence and a guy's clenching you and you have time to think you're [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2439.12s)]
*  like, Oh shit, that's when it sets in. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2442.08s)]
*  This is happening. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2444.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2446.0s)]
*  Cause you almost have moments, there's times where you see the fighters kind of look around [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2447.0s)]
*  or they'll, they'll just be locked in a moment. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2448.72s)]
*  And it was kind of engaged with somebody almost or yeah, it's, it's, it's a real, like when [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2450.7599999999998s)]
*  that moment of clarity sets in, when the, when the fight slows down a little bit, it's [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2454.84s)]
*  pretty crazy, man. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  Cause then you can hear the crowd and it's sometimes I can hear the commentators, like [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2459.7200000000003s)]
*  I'll hear Joe Rogan through the fence talking. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2462.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2464.8s)]
*  Um, if boxing, yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2466.8s)]
*  So who would you fight if you had to do a celebrity boxing match? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2468.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you have any thoughts on it ever? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2471.6000000000004s)]
*  Biden maybe? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2473.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2474.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's already, he already lost. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2475.7200000000003s)]
*  The bell might wobble him when it starts. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2480.36s)]
*  You ready? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2482.0s)]
*  Fight. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2484.28s)]
*  I think even if they let him use like 12 year old kids as smell insults though, I think [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2485.28s)]
*  he might bounce back, you know, or fight Hunter Biden. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2489.52s)]
*  Oh, that'll be a good one. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2492.48s)]
*  Coked up. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2495.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2496.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2497.04s)]
*  That'll be a good one. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2498.04s)]
*  I'd hate to fight all coked up. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2499.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2500.04s)]
*  It'd be the worst. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2501.04s)]
*  Um, yeah, I'm trying to think of something else I was going to ask you about. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2502.04s)]
*  They should do Trump Biden. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2507.36s)]
*  They should do. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2508.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2509.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2511.36s)]
*  That'll be a good one. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2512.36s)]
*  I think it's like pay-per-view blockbuster. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2513.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2515.32s)]
*  I wonder who would actually, well, Trump would probably win. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2516.32s)]
*  I think from pushing him over. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2519.56s)]
*  I don't know if Trump, Trump has, does this. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2520.84s)]
*  He has like that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2523.8s)]
*  Seems a little bit more peppinessed out. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2524.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2526.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2527.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2528.7200000000003s)]
*  He might have a little bit more. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2529.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, I'd bet the money line on that one. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2530.7200000000003s)]
*  Trump. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2533.0s)]
*  Did you, can you bet on yourself legally? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2534.0s)]
*  I used to be able to, um, ever since like maybe a year ago, they put in that, that claw [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2537.0s)]
*  or that rule. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2542.04s)]
*  So I completely stopped, but I still bet on boxing and football and stuff. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2543.72s)]
*  Can anyone in your house that could be. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2546.88s)]
*  I bet on myself. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2548.44s)]
*  Sorry to cut you off. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2549.44s)]
*  I bet on myself a bunch of times coming up. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2550.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2551.44s)]
*  Like when I first started fighting in Vegas, you know, Oh yeah. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2552.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2554.52s)]
*  What's the most that you ever bet on yourself? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2555.52s)]
*  You think? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2556.8s)]
*  Not much. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2557.8s)]
*  Maybe 500, a thousand maybe. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2558.8s)]
*  That's a lot though. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2560.04s)]
*  When you're coming up. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2561.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2562.04s)]
*  That was a lot. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2563.04s)]
*  That's a lot, dude. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2564.04s)]
*  But I don't know if I've ever laid a thousand dollars on somebody. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2565.04s)]
*  Maybe I have. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2566.04s)]
*  I can't, I can't get into one of my accounts. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2567.04s)]
*  So I haven't been able to bet on you in a long time, but. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2569.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2573.48s)]
*  I think by knockout, I was like plus three 70. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2574.48s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2576.4s)]
*  I got to fucking figure out. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2577.4s)]
*  I think they stole my money, but, but yeah, I don't even know what company was, but yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2579.4s)]
*  What do you think, man? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2586.48s)]
*  I was going to say this. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2587.48s)]
*  A lot of people are talking about aliens all the time and I'm talking about Joe Rogan, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2588.48s)]
*  but if they attack us, right. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2592.6800000000003s)]
*  And we have to send five UFC fighters to save the planet. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2597.0800000000004s)]

*  Well, I'll say this. A lot of them, their lateral movement struggles, but they [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2656.48s)]
*  they can like blink and order Starbucks. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2660.84s)]

*  Yeah. I went over there, but he would go anyway, man. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2680.96s)]
*  Yeah. The one of the best things I ever saw was like one of the first UFC fights [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2684.48s)]
*  ever went to. He's just backstage. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2688.44s)]
*  He's in the backstage and literally just walking around looking almost [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2690.2400000000002s)]
*  like I like to fight anybody. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2694.2000000000003s)]

*  He was fighting that night. No, he wasn't. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  I was a crazy part, but it was just like showing up, like showing I'm ready. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2699.32s)]
*  You know, it seems like there's a lot of like [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2703.88s)]
*  like because you just get so few chances to show your shine in your sport. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2707.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, every dude, every time we go out there, it's the Super Bowl. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2711.64s)]
*  You know, it's not like we have we train [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2714.52s)]
*  three or four months to prepare for this moment. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2717.6400000000003s)]
*  It could be 15 or 25 minutes. The whole world's watching. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2719.4s)]
*  There's no redo's. There's no finger pointing. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2721.7200000000003s)]
*  My you know, my teammates weren't picking up the slack or whatever. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2724.04s)]
*  It's all you. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2727.1600000000003s)]
*  And if you lose, it's going to be a while till you get that opportunity again. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2728.04s)]
*  So everyone's a Super Bowl. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2731.52s)]
*  You know, it's such every fight's the biggest fight. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2732.6000000000004s)]
*  It's exciting, but it's scary at the same time. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2737.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think that's what makes it so appealing to so many people. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2739.4s)]
*  I mean, the sport's grown so much since you've been in it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2745.08s)]

*  just watching it grow in the fan, the new fan base, you know, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2755.12s)]
*  because when I first started, it was older, like older men watching this. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2757.36s)]
*  Now kids and even grandmothers are talking about fighting at the grocery store. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2760.92s)]

*  UFC, they did big events like 10,000 or they go to the MGM or the Mandalay. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2802.1200000000003s)]

*  But they would only do pay per views every few months. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2808.4s)]
*  You know, now there's a fight every week. Yeah. Every week. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2811.88s)]
*  That's another thing that was cool at the beginning of fighting, too. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2814.84s)]
*  When I first got to the UFC, like you win a big fight. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2816.96s)]
*  That win, that high lasted for months because that's how long it was until the next event. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=2819.76s)]

*  If you send somebody's nuts to somebody. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3091.52s)]
*  That to me seems like I wouldn't like if somebody sent me their nuts, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3095.0s)]
*  even if it was a hero of mine, you know, even if it was damn [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3099.7999999999997s)]

*  When I started podcasting, having an online store was probably one of the last [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3241.08s)]
*  things I thought about. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3245.92s)]
*  I never thought about being like a mercantile operator or anything. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3246.96s)]
*  And as things got busier, we wanted to put out a T-shirt or a package of stickers. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3250.6400000000003s)]
*  And then that evolved. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3257.52s)]
*  The next thing you know, you're putting out a sweatshirt and a baby bib, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3259.0s)]
*  different little items, silverware for a senior. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3263.48s)]
*  And before I knew it, we had a lot of items and we needed help. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3266.6000000000004s)]
*  And that became so easy because I use Shopify. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3271.76s)]

*  You know, my social battery gets depleted pretty easy, I'll say it, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3317.2s)]
*  and I'll keep committing to things and then there's too many things. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3322.2799999999997s)]
*  And then I realized, man, you never really have any time for yourself. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3325.7999999999997s)]

*  And so putting me first sometimes is important. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3333.36s)]
*  And sometimes I need somebody else to discuss that with, to reflect and help me [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3336.28s)]
*  make a plan for myself. That's where therapy comes in for me. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3340.88s)]

*  What else we got in the news, Nick? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3393.64s)]
*  Governor DeSantis enacted a social media ban for children under 14. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3396.68s)]
*  It's supposed to go into effect January 1st and kids 14 to 16 need their parents' [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3403.48s)]
*  permission. My wife was just talking about that. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3409.3199999999997s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3412.08s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed one of the country's most restrictive social [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3412.6800000000003s)]
*  media bills into law Monday banning children under the age of 14 from having [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3415.6s)]
*  accounts and requiring children age 14 to 16 have parental consent to hold one. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3419.4s)]
*  Oh, what do you think about that? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3423.8s)]
*  You guys have a child, do you? What's that like for you? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3425.8s)]
*  Do you think about this kind of stuff and the effects it could have on your kid? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3428.12s)]
*  For sure, man. Yeah, we do. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3431.2400000000002s)]
*  And she's not on social media or anything like that. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3432.7200000000003s)]
*  But she does have an iPad we give her on the weekends she can use. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3435.7200000000003s)]
*  Like Friday night, Saturday night when she's out of school, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3439.7200000000003s)]
*  she's on it, you know, or if we're traveling, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3441.68s)]
*  she'll watch movies and play games on her iPad. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3443.68s)]
*  But [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3445.6s)]
*  yeah, I don't think it's good, you know, like being at that age 14, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3447.3999999999996s)]
*  start high school, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3451.48s)]
*  your friends and who's popular at school, you know, it affects you like you're, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3454.12s)]
*  I don't know, it's hard to put into words, but it's a big deal, man. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3459.04s)]
*  Think about how tough it was without this. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3461.56s)]
*  Yeah. Now, now you have this and it's just you [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3463.8399999999997s)]
*  see the bullying and stuff like that on there. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3466.64s)]
*  I don't think a kid can handle all that. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3468.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3469.96s)]
*  I mean, well, they have so many kids that like have had taken their lives, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3471.2s)]
*  had a lot of issues with online bullying. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3475.68s)]
*  And as a parent, the scary thing is a parent, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3477.7999999999997s)]
*  you don't even know it's happening sometimes, I think. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3479.8399999999997s)]
*  So that's probably one of the things I think would probably be good if they had. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3483.08s)]
*  But also like raising a kid, all of her friends are going to be on social media [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3486.64s)]
*  when they get that age and she might be the weird one out if we don't let her. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3489.72s)]
*  It's a weird place to be in. Yeah. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3493.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of parents don't set controls on their kids' social media. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3495.8399999999997s)]
*  They just think the kid isn't going to get into stuff, you know? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3499.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3501.88s)]
*  But I think, yeah, I don't have any children. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3503.0s)]
*  But yeah, it would seem like as a parent, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3504.84s)]
*  you got to make those choices because your child's not really going to, you know, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3506.32s)]
*  they're going to make some of them, but you got to really look out for your kid [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3509.6s)]
*  at all in every space. Yeah. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3513.56s)]
*  And that's crazy because somebody could get to your child through social media. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3515.32s)]
*  It's just so wild, you know? Right. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3518.64s)]
*  And just the stuff they're exposed to, man, the Internet's a wild place. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3520.56s)]

*  What did he call it? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3557.52s)]
*  This guy would hit home runs all the time. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3560.12s)]
*  My name is Alfredo. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3563.76s)]

*  Well, it's him as an adult. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3575.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's still hitting Dangers. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3576.88s)]
*  Dangers. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3578.7200000000003s)]
*  That's got to be heavy for kids. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3580.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think kids. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3581.96s)]
*  Yeah, because if something happens to you [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3582.52s)]
*  when you're a kid and it goes big on social media, then you're that kid forever. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3583.6s)]
*  Right. If you're like the kid that like yells a slur or something or calls [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3586.7599999999998s)]
*  somebody a G.A.Y. or something when they're on like dental gas or whatever. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3591.64s)]
*  And then [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3596.56s)]
*  that's who you are forever. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3598.2799999999997s)]
*  Like you can run for mayor years later on that. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3599.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3602.52s)]

*  Oh, God, that shit is fun. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3605.16s)]
*  Uh, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3607.12s)]
*  you ever get any good gas, any good stuff to huff out there? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3608.6s)]
*  Whippets back in the day, not the not the dental gas. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3612.2000000000003s)]
*  Back when I used to work at a restaurant, we used to crack them whippets. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3615.04s)]
*  Oh, dude, the whipped cream, whenever they finally put it on dessert, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3618.2000000000003s)]
*  that shit was just kind of dribbling out of it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3621.4s)]
*  It was dribbling out of my lungs. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3624.32s)]
*  Yeah, but it was nothing left. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3627.96s)]
*  There was no whipped cream left for your dessert. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3630.04s)]
*  What's the number one fight that you would make outside of your division? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3634.04s)]
*  Is there a fight that? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3638.12s)]
*  I really want to see the 145 pound champ, Toporia. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3640.6800000000003s)]
*  I want to see him fight Max. You do? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3643.8s)]
*  Yeah, because like Volk was the only guy Max couldn't beat at 45. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3645.6s)]
*  He's, you know, pretty much cleaned out the division. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3648.28s)]
*  Now there's a new young blood, great striker, good grappler. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3650.08s)]
*  I think that would be an incredible fight, man. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3653.28s)]
*  Max versus Toporia. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3656.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild, because who just called him out to Sugar Sean just called him out. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3657.6800000000003s)]
*  But to put that would be a going to. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3660.92s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a going. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3662.76s)]
*  Do Max and Sugar Sean, are they in the same? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3664.32s)]
*  No, Max is 45, Sean's 135. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3667.48s)]
*  OK, well, but Sean's pretty tall, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3670.36s)]
*  you know, pretty decent size for the division, but Max is a lot thicker than him. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3673.1600000000003s)]
*  So but Sean might move up out of his division. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3677.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not sure. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3680.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he was talking about it. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  Do you think about that for any more of your fight? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3684.04s)]
*  Are you happy in your division? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3685.84s)]
*  I'm happy. I like a lot of people wanted me to go up to 170. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3687.48s)]
*  But, dude, like this morning, I weighed myself when I woke up. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3691.48s)]
*  I was 173. You know, I can't. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3694.48s)]
*  I can't fight at 170 pounds. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3696.32s)]
*  Those guys are going to rehydrate and be 190 for a fight night. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3697.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3700.2000000000003s)]
*  Like at the top, at the highest level, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3701.6800000000003s)]
*  a guy with 20 pounds on you on fight night, you know, in grappling positions [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3704.36s)]
*  and side control, half guard is just that weight really matters when guys not use it. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3708.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3712.96s)]
*  What about [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3714.88s)]
*  this guy? You ever heard him? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3717.0s)]
*  Blood Diamond is his name. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3718.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's out of Sonia's friend. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3720.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3722.52s)]
*  I think I've seen him fight, but I don't know much about him. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3723.7999999999997s)]
*  I wonder if there'd ever be a fight for like the real, you know, the less. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3727.0s)]
*  You know, the he's a 55. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3732.0s)]
*  No, what is he's one? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3734.04s)]
*  170 if you ever go up just to. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3737.08s)]
*  Put an end to the like, I would fight at 170 feels like a really, really big fight, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3741.12s)]
*  but I'm not trying to make a run in the welterweight division, and those guys are [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3745.72s)]
*  huge. Yeah, I used to get a lot heavier, though, like the last couple of years, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3748.72s)]
*  I've been walking around a lot lighter. Really? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3753.28s)]
*  Yeah. Outside of training camp, I've been eating clean, you know, before I would [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3755.48s)]
*  get in shape during camp and then after the fight, eat pizza every day and enjoy [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3759.6400000000003s)]
*  life. You know, but I've the older I got, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3763.84s)]
*  the easier it is for me to just eat healthy and be all right. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3765.8s)]
*  I don't need to eat all that crazy stuff. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3767.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. You just start caring about you. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3769.52s)]
*  We have to just start having a more of a general care about yourself. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3771.1600000000003s)]
*  What else? Oh, yeah, I saw this right here. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3776.96s)]

*  pupils so you can get you can pay more money. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3783.92s)]
*  And if your school has like special needs kids or whatever, they'll take them out [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3788.96s)]
*  of the photos at school. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3793.88s)]
*  Well, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3797.32s)]

*  Right. So. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3807.36s)]
*  And if you pay a little bit more than a couple of kids come off crutches, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3808.12s)]

*  Do you feel like you're just you're figuring it out? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3851.88s)]
*  Do you feel like it's up to you? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3854.68s)]
*  Do you feel like it's up to the UFC? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3855.92s)]
*  Where does it what does it feel like? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3857.8s)]
*  Kind of. It's definitely up to me. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3859.7599999999998s)]
*  And, you know, my wife, my coaches, they want me to keep going. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3861.52s)]
*  My wife wants me to stop on my coaches. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3866.04s)]
*  No, I still have it. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3867.6s)]
*  I'm just taking it one fight at a time. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3870.2s)]
*  I still feel good. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3871.48s)]
*  Like I said, my wife wants me to stop, though. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3872.24s)]
*  My daughter wants me to stop, too. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3874.4s)]
*  Oh, she does. Yeah. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3875.56s)]
*  What did she say? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3876.88s)]
*  Yeah. Well, like, what is that like? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3878.08s)]
*  Because at a certain point, it kind of turns on for your kid. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3879.2799999999997s)]
*  What's going on? She's old enough now. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3881.32s)]
*  She knows that I fight, you know, she knows what it is. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3882.96s)]
*  And she wants me to be home. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3886.56s)]
*  You know, when I do camps, I'm going for eight weeks. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3887.68s)]
*  They'll come out for two weeks. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3890.92s)]
*  We try not to do more than two weeks apart. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3891.96s)]
*  So I'll do like the first two weeks and they'll meet me and I'll do the last. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3893.72s)]
*  Two weeks. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3896.2s)]
*  But [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3897.12s)]
*  she doesn't want me to fight anymore. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3898.68s)]
*  She doesn't want to see me come home with stitches. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3899.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, since she was a baby, she's been like pulling stitches out of my face [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3901.44s)]
*  and stuff after fights. Oh, that's insane. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3904.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost that's almost like [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3906.88s)]
*  on [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3909.52s)]
*  Lady and the Tramp when the kids meet at the spaghetti or something a little bit. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3911.56s)]
*  It's a different version of that. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3914.96s)]
*  Yeah. Where the puppies meet or whatever. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3916.36s)]
*  What's your favorite business? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3920.32s)]
*  You got involved in some businesses outside of work, man. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3921.32s)]
*  What's that been like for you? Becoming more of like a business guy? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3924.2s)]
*  Is that enough of a thing to [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3926.96s)]
*  entertain you enough outside of the sport and to keep you busy enough? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3931.0s)]
*  Like, has that started to tip the scales enough? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3936.52s)]
*  I think that's another thing that happens [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3938.8399999999997s)]
*  in people's lives who also have the opportunity to get into businesses. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3940.6s)]
*  At a certain point, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3944.72s)]
*  the business can start to become something that still [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3946.7999999999997s)]
*  appeases them and makes them feel, you know, like busy, like you like to stay busy. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3952.16s)]
*  Yeah, but it's about balance. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3956.64s)]
*  I can't do too much of the business because it takes away from the fighting. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3957.88s)]
*  And fighting is still my main thing. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3961.52s)]
*  But the business stuff keeps me busy. It's fun. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3963.84s)]
*  It's new. You know, I'm learning a lot. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3965.6s)]
*  I have the hot sauce, have a bourbon, have a liquor store in Lafayette. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3967.88s)]
*  Hot water. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3973.08s)]
*  I'm a partner with them. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3974.28s)]
*  You know, just have a lot of stuff going on outside of fighting that keeps me busy. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3976.48s)]
*  And that's good, man. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3979.56s)]
*  You know, like I said, I have to be busy. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3980.92s)]
*  I have to be busy. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3982.84s)]
*  Yeah. But it's but it's balance. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3983.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's balance. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3986.2000000000003s)]
*  So right now you train right now? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3987.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to go box tonight. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3989.88s)]
*  And this Friday I'm going to do Jiu Jitsu, but I'm still training. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3991.2000000000003s)]
*  OK. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3994.7200000000003s)]
*  Five mile frats. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3998.1200000000003s)]
*  What do you all do? Five mile Sundays? Five mile Sundays. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=3999.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, man. Five miles is fun, huh? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4001.44s)]
*  Yeah, I do it fasted. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4003.36s)]
*  Like at the end of my training camp, I do 24 hour fasts and then finish my [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4004.76s)]
*  fast with the run, then I'll break my fast. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4009.12s)]
*  You know, like a run, Madonna or whatever. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4011.24s)]
*  Not. Yeah, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4013.2s)]
*  that's not it. No, it's similar. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4015.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4017.44s)]
*  Somebody was doing that. Yeah. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4018.24s)]
*  This vape shop. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4019.4s)]
*  It is right now. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4021.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's got to be. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4022.64s)]
*  Yeah, this fucking I wouldn't shut up about it. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4024.04s)]
*  A mirror problem. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4026.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, could have been a mirror. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4027.96s)]
*  But yeah, this guy fucking vaping. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4029.04s)]
*  I'm like, dude, if you vape enough fucking watermelon, that's counts as eating. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4030.8399999999997s)]
*  If you do 200 puffs, that's counts as eating. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4036.08s)]
*  March 10th to April 9th. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4039.56s)]
*  What other avenue can we go down here? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4042.36s)]
*  Dustin, is there something else that you want to think about or like that? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4043.76s)]
*  How have you been doing, man? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4046.6400000000003s)]
*  I've been doing pretty good, dude. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4049.8s)]
*  I think, you know, I still. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4051.76s)]
*  Yeah, everything has been fun. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4056.2000000000003s)]
*  I think sometimes I get busy with work and it feels like I don't even know what [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4057.84s)]
*  I'm doing. You're just going almost going through the motion sometimes. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4061.64s)]
*  So it's like [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4065.7599999999998s)]
*  that feels tough sometimes or it just feels like a challenge, I guess. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4068.16s)]
*  Like, am I doing anything that means anything or am I just like [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4072.24s)]
*  showing up to work each day, like clocking in? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4077.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4080.56s)]
*  Even though it's your own job and things you want to be doing, it still like [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4081.16s)]
*  sometimes feels like that. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4084.7599999999998s)]
*  What else? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4088.0s)]
*  Yeah, I still have a lot of trouble like feeling like proud of myself. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4089.2s)]
*  You know, I think about that kind of stuff a lot. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4091.7999999999997s)]
*  And I talked about that with people on the podcast, just like what it's like to [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4095.96s)]
*  it just so hard for me to like people are always like, man, you should take a moment [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4100.639999999999s)]
*  and just feel happy. It's like it just I always want to [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4104.4s)]
*  there's always a part of me that's trying to figure out the next thing. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4109.28s)]
*  You know, it's really hard to [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4113.12s)]
*  just feel good about something, you know. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4115.639999999999s)]
*  So I don't know what that's about. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4118.8s)]
*  What else outside of that? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4122.64s)]
*  Your show's going good in Louisiana? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4125.12s)]
*  Yeah, we had fun. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4127.52s)]
*  That was some of my best shows, man. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4129.08s)]
*  I know you guys came out to the last one at UNO and that was awesome. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4130.6s)]
*  We still have a lot of people that talk about that. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4134.92s)]
*  You were there. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4136.4400000000005s)]
*  I ran into a guy at the gym the other day. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4137.360000000001s)]
*  He's like, yeah, you brought out dust and that was awesome. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4139.08s)]
*  But we had some great shows this weekend. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4142.8s)]
*  Nice. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4144.92s)]
*  I just got a cyber truck, too. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4146.12s)]
*  Oh, you were telling me that. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4148.64s)]
*  Yeah. You got it. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4149.76s)]
*  Yeah. How is it? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4150.6s)]
*  It's wild, bro. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4152.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, for one, you feel like you kind of work at Lowe's kind of a little [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4153.84s)]
*  because it feels like you're supposed to be like delivering something to somebody, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4158.52s)]
*  but you never drop it off. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4161.68s)]
*  What do you put back there? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4163.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4164.8s)]
*  It's just the whole car feels a little bit like appliance. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4165.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4168.64s)]
*  So it feels like it feels like sometimes somebody's just going to open up the back [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4169.56s)]
*  and just put a TV dinner in it, you know, it just has this like kind of or just put [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4174.320000000001s)]
*  a load of laundry in there, just press a button. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4178.92s)]
*  You know, it has an appliancey kind of feel. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4181.2s)]
*  But then it makes this sound when you go [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4184.28s)]

*  yelling at it and just cracked a beer open. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4206.72s)]
*  And I was like, God, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4209.8s)]
*  I feel a little bit like [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4212.56s)]
*  because people look over at it and then well, first, I thought the windows were [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4215.400000000001s)]

*  I think I was a little bit embarrassed, like at first, like [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4244.16s)]
*  because everybody looks at it and you kind of don't want to be the center of [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4247.599999999999s)]
*  attention sometimes you like. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFR2d5RKqE&t=4251.2s)]
