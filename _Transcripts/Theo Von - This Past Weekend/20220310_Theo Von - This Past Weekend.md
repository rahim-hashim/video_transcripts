*  Today's guest, I'm grateful to finally have her in studio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  She is from Atlanta, but has been living in Indiana for quite some time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=5.0s)]
*  We'll hear more about it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=10.0s)]
*  She is the creator and star of The Miss Pat Show, which is currently on BET+, and Paramount+. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=12.0s)]

*  You can check it out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=23.0s)]
*  It's called Y'all Want to Hear Something Crazy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=24.0s)]
*  She's my new friend, and she brought some beautiful ladies with her. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=28.0s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=32.0s)]
*  Some real lookers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=33.0s)]
*  The hilarious Miss Pat. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=36.0s)]
*  So you're moving back to Atlanta. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=58.0s)]
*  Are you excited? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=73.0s)]
*  I just moved back. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=74.0s)]
*  I am excited. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=76.0s)]
*  I shoot the show there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=77.0s)]
*  I shoot The Miss Pat Show there, and I shot my special there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=79.0s)]
*  I'm from Atlanta, so my husband just retired. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=81.0s)]
*  And I was like, look, I'm ready to get the fuck out of Indiana. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=83.0s)]
*  Let's go home. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=86.0s)]
*  So I bought some land, and I'm building on it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=87.0s)]
*  Dang. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=92.0s)]
*  What y'all going to have? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=93.0s)]
*  Like anything special at the house? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=94.0s)]
*  Like anything you always wanted? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=95.0s)]
*  I wanted a podcast studio, because right now I was doing it a little bit everywhere. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=97.0s)]
*  I do it on Zoom. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=101.0s)]
*  And then when I was in Indie, I would do it out of my movie theater room. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=102.0s)]
*  So I really want to get big time like you and everybody else. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=105.0s)]
*  So I built a podcast studio outside the house. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=108.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=112.0s)]

*  Oh, nice. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=117.0s)]
*  It's going to be all right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=119.0s)]
*  You got any fancy neighbors? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=120.0s)]
*  Like is it in a fancy place? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=121.0s)]
*  No, it's not in a fancy place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=123.0s)]
*  Twelve people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=125.0s)]

*  At y'all's house? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=128.0s)]

*  Oh, your neighborhood. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=130.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=131.0s)]
*  A little small neighborhood. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=132.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=133.0s)]
*  And it had a couple of acreages, and I just bought it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=134.0s)]
*  Dang. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=136.0s)]
*  I knew I wanted a big house, but I didn't want a big mortgage. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=139.0s)]
*  So I just found some land, and I sold the house down, and I'm going to get with it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=140.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=143.0s)]
*  And who's going to live at the house with you? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=144.0s)]
*  Your husband, you? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=145.0s)]
*  I have four kids that I have custody of, my niece's kids, and then I have a 21, or 22, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=146.0s)]

*  I felt, even just a half hour of your special, I felt like I watched, like it reminded me [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=158.0s)]
*  of The Wire. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=163.0s)]

*  Me too. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=171.0s)]
*  My husband is a Christian. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=172.0s)]
*  I mean, he grew up Christian, so, and I grew up, you know, of course, selling drugs. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=173.0s)]
*  You know my background. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=177.0s)]
*  And he was kept raving about, you got to watch this show. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=178.0s)]
*  I don't want to watch that bullshit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=180.0s)]
*  I live this shit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=181.0s)]
*  And one day I sat down and I watched The Wire, I was like, oh my God, this shit is so fucking [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=182.0s)]
*  real. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=188.0s)]

*  They did a good fucking job. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=190.0s)]
*  But I think I got into it like in the fourth season. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=193.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=315.0s)]
*  I think they down in Georgia, aren't they? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=316.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=318.0s)]
*  Bo Duke. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=320.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=322.0s)]
*  One of them I think preferred men. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=323.0s)]
*  I could be wrong, but I don't know. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=325.0s)]
*  So tell me, so your husband, I heard you met him and he was in the military, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=329.0s)]
*  and then, and now he's done, he's retired? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=333.0s)]
*  He retired. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=337.0s)]
*  He, what was he, six, seven years in the military or something like that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=338.0s)]
*  And when I met him, he had just got out, so he was really young. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=343.0s)]
*  And he worked for General Motors, he makes the Allison transmission [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=346.0s)]
*  for the military division. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=350.0s)]
*  And so he retired about two, three months ago. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=352.0s)]
*  In December he retired. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=355.0s)]
*  Is it weird, because some people say when people get retired, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=357.0s)]
*  then it gets weird around the house because somebody's around more. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=360.0s)]
*  I'm never around, so I'm just like, literally, I do morning radio [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=363.0s)]
*  at V103 in Atlanta, and then I leave there and I go to sit. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=368.0s)]
*  And if I'm not doing sit, I'm fucking traveling. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=372.0s)]
*  But it's a little weird having him home during the day. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=375.0s)]
*  I think he's bored out of his mind. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=378.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what do you want to do? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=380.0s)]
*  I'm cool. I'm cool. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=381.0s)]
*  I'm like, you want to come see me tape the show? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=382.0s)]
*  Because it's in front of a live studio audience. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=384.0s)]
*  I'm cool. I'm cool. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=386.0s)]
*  So I just, I think he's just got to adjust, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=387.0s)]
*  because my husband's so used to being head of the household, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=389.0s)]
*  and he's been working our whole fucking marriage. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=392.0s)]
*  Since I've known him, and this is his first time not having a job. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=395.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=399.0s)]
*  I think he's kind of adjust to the shit. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=400.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I got to get a wife or something one day. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=403.0s)]
*  I only ever been with one black woman in my life, and she had like... [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=407.0s)]
*  You know it's legal. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=413.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=415.0s)]
*  Ain't nobody stopping you, Theo. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=417.0s)]
*  That money you rocking might be stopping you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=419.0s)]
*  This a stop sign for black women. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=422.0s)]
*  Well, it don't say you like us. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=424.0s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=427.0s)]
*  That haircut do not say you like sisters. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=429.0s)]
*  Damn, I got it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=431.0s)]
*  Maybe I need to put on something else, some bead work or something. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=432.0s)]
*  I've never seen a black woman fuck a white dude with a mullet. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=434.0s)]
*  Oh, we about to change the game there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=437.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=439.0s)]
*  Well, you need to cut that mullet off. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=440.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know, baby. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=441.0s)]
*  This is really my fire powers in there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=442.0s)]
*  Well, you need to explain to the black woman, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=444.0s)]
*  this is my fire power. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=446.0s)]
*  It ain't what you thinking. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=448.0s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=450.0s)]
*  No, it's not like a racist emblem. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=451.0s)]
*  It's just I just feel more confident with it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=453.0s)]
*  Well, you don't have on a Confederate flag, but it's just... [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=455.0s)]
*  No. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=457.0s)]
*  It's the haircut. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=458.0s)]
*  It is, huh? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=459.0s)]
*  Black women are very particular about what their men look like. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=463.0s)]
*  That's why you never really see black men with dirty shoes. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=464.0s)]
*  Unless they just ain't got no money. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=470.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=472.0s)]
*  But if you fly, you're going to always see black men with clean shoes on. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=473.0s)]
*  Yeah, black people always smell real exciting. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=476.0s)]
*  Exciting that damn. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=479.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, dude, you know if a fucking... [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=481.0s)]
*  You'll meet a brother, he smell like a damn bath and body works. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=484.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=487.0s)]
*  Sometimes black people, I feel like a lot of times they just are more... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=488.0s)]
*  Flashy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=492.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=493.0s)]
*  Flashy, yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=494.0s)]
*  Why is it? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=495.0s)]
*  Why is it? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=497.0s)]
*  Because we make everything look good. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=499.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=501.0s)]
*  I mean, if you want to sell something, let's be honest, who you take it to? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=502.0s)]
*  You take it to the African American, you take it to the black people, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=505.0s)]
*  because we make everything flash. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=508.0s)]
*  Black men, how you doing that wrong? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=510.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=511.0s)]
*  I mean, think about it, how many white athletes got a shoe? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=512.0s)]
*  Your boy, Tom Brady had some hugs. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=517.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=520.0s)]
*  And then, oh boy, Larry Bird had the converse, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=523.0s)]
*  and it's only because of him and Magic had that thing going on back in the day. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=526.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=530.0s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=531.0s)]
*  You got to... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=532.0s)]
*  I don't think black people buy white shoe. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=534.0s)]
*  That's a good point, huh? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=536.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you want something to sell, you take it off. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=537.0s)]
*  Damn, huh? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=541.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're walking the advertisement all the time. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=542.0s)]
*  We turn anything hot and fresh. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=544.0s)]
*  Yeah, huh? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think people always look to the black community for what's cool, huh? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=547.0s)]
*  We're the coolest people on earth. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=554.0s)]
*  Nobody's cooler than us. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=555.0s)]
*  That's why we cop it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=556.0s)]
*  Yeah, let me think who else could be. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=558.0s)]
*  Maybe aliens. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=560.0s)]
*  I heard somewhere that black people and aliens don't get along. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=561.0s)]
*  Did you ever hear? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=563.0s)]
*  Is that like a thing in the black culture? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=564.0s)]
*  Do you really think aliens are fucking real? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=565.0s)]
*  I mean, they got to have some of them. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=568.0s)]
*  Well, how many times do you think a black person made an alien? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=571.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=575.0s)]
*  Do you know anything? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=576.0s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=577.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=578.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=579.0s)]
*  I don't know if you guys are telling or not saying something. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=580.0s)]
*  Who the fuck do you think knows this? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=583.0s)]
*  White people? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=585.0s)]
*  Y'all motherfuckers know if it was aliens before us. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=586.0s)]
*  We mind our motherfucking business. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=588.0s)]
*  You ain't never heard no black people say, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=590.0s)]
*  I'm just going to go to the moon and fuck with these people in the sky. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=591.0s)]
*  That's white people shit. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=594.0s)]
*  That ain't all shit. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=596.0s)]
*  The fuck are you talking about? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=597.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably true. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=598.0s)]
*  Well, aliens and black people don't get along. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=599.0s)]
*  What the fuck they're supposed to be. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=601.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=602.0s)]
*  That's just what I heard. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=603.0s)]
*  That's like something I heard through the grapevine over the years. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=604.0s)]
*  It's like an old wives tale or something. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=606.0s)]
*  Well, let me, I've heard all white men dick is small. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=608.0s)]
*  That ain't true, is it? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=611.0s)]
*  No. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=612.0s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=613.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=614.0s)]
*  You hurry up and defend that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=615.0s)]
*  No, no, absolutely not. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=617.0s)]
*  Oh, that's wild. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=620.0s)]
*  What else is going on today? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=623.0s)]
*  Not much really. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=626.0s)]
*  Just chilling pretty much, you know. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=627.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of something else super that's exciting. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=629.0s)]
*  So you got your special out. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=631.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=633.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=634.0s)]
*  And I watched about 30 minutes of it last night. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=635.0s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=636.0s)]
*  You tell so many jokes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=637.0s)]
*  I mean, you just, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=638.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=640.0s)]
*  Robert Townsend directed it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=641.0s)]
*  And it wasn't easy getting together with him. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=643.0s)]
*  Boy, he worked the shit out of me. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=646.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=647.0s)]
*  I had to meet with him once a week for four hours a day. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=648.0s)]
*  On Zoom and do my whole set. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=652.0s)]
*  And he would take it and twist it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=654.0s)]
*  He would listen to every set I did out on the road. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=656.0s)]
*  And hit me back that Monday and say, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=659.0s)]
*  this is what we're going to work on this Wednesday. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=661.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=663.0s)]
*  Yes, I am serious. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=664.0s)]
*  I've never heard of a director doing that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=665.0s)]
*  I haven't either. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=666.0s)]
*  But, you know, to step to Robert Townsend and say, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=667.0s)]
*  you want him to direct your special when he only did Raw for Eddie Murphy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=669.0s)]
*  I think I hope I said the right one for Eddie Murphy. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=674.0s)]
*  He did Eddie Murphy Raw and he did Bill Cosby last one. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=677.0s)]
*  To step to say you want him to direct your special, that was huge. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=680.0s)]
*  And he was like, no. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=684.0s)]
*  And I was like, I need you. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=685.0s)]
*  I knew I just needed him. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=687.0s)]
*  You know, I just felt like he was a director that would care, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=689.0s)]
*  that would sit down. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=692.0s)]
*  This was my first special. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=693.0s)]
*  I really wanted it to be good. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=694.0s)]
*  And it took a minute, but he finally came through and he directed it for me. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=696.0s)]
*  And it was not easy work. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=700.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=702.0s)]
*  He really put you through it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=703.0s)]
*  He put me through it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=704.0s)]
*  I mean, so I was supposed to tape it a year early, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=705.0s)]
*  but the pandemic hit. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=708.0s)]
*  So he came on right after the pandemic hit, I think. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=709.0s)]
*  And he worked the dog shit out of me. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=713.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=716.0s)]
*  I will call him again if I got another special because, you know, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=717.0s)]
*  when you drop a special, you really worried about, you know, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=720.0s)]
*  do people think it's funny? Is it going to flow right? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=722.0s)]
*  I didn't watch it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=725.0s)]
*  I watched the cuts and put together, but I was like, I don't really want to be, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=726.0s)]
*  you know, because I'm scared. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=729.0s)]
*  I'm scared what people are going to think about it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=731.0s)]
*  And I just started to look at the feedback. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=733.0s)]
*  People are like, oh my God, it's so good. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=735.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=736.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=737.0s)]
*  It's just Joe. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=738.0s)]
*  It reminds me of comedy back in the day. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=739.0s)]
*  And, you know, because I'm not, I'm not, I say what the fuck I want to say. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=740.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you do. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=744.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=745.0s)]
*  More than anybody. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=746.0s)]
*  I think I've heard in a long time. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=748.0s)]
*  So, I mean, you know, the council culture, they out there. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=749.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not worried about them. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=752.0s)]
*  I'm going to say what the fuck I want to say. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=754.0s)]
*  You digested how the fuck you want to say it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=758.0s)]
*  And one of the things that was really, Robert really liked the thing I did at the end. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=759.0s)]
*  I don't know if you got to the end. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=764.0s)]
*  I mean, my daughter is gay. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=765.0s)]
*  And I tell all of these bits about my daughter being gay. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=766.0s)]
*  And then I do this whole speech at the end about, you know, which at first I didn't think [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=770.0s)]
*  they was going to take it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=777.0s)]
*  So I said, I said, no matter what you've been through in life, learn how to laugh at it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=778.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck if somebody stuck their thumb up your ass. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=781.0s)]
*  If they didn't get past the knuckle, you won. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=784.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=786.0s)]
*  And Netflix was like, what the fuck? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=787.0s)]
*  But that's what I've been saying on stage with that hour I had for the longest. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=789.0s)]
*  Because I mean, I won't, I don't give a fuck what you've been through. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=797.0s)]
*  You can get through it if you believe that you can get through it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=800.0s)]
*  The mind is a strong muscle. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=803.0s)]
*  It take on what you put in it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=805.0s)]
*  If you say I'm depressed, it going to be your mind will make your whole body depressed. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=807.0s)]
*  So I don't use words like unhappy and depressed and I can't. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=811.0s)]
*  I tell a motherfucker, there's not a such thing as you can't. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=815.0s)]
*  There's a yes, some way if you keep trying. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=818.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good attitude. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=821.0s)]
*  Yeah, I recently been thinking that like whatever I thought, if I have a thought, it becomes a feeling. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=823.0s)]
*  So I got to be real careful about what my thoughts are. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=827.0s)]
*  Yeah, because if you say, if you tell yourself that you're not good, your mind will make you the whole body feel like you're not him. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=830.0s)]
*  And I've just learned that I learned that actually from a teacher. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=836.0s)]
*  Her name was Miss Troupe. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=840.0s)]
*  She said you can do and be anything in the fucking world you want to be. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=841.0s)]
*  The dumbest question is the question not asked. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=844.0s)]
*  And that made me ask people any fucking thing I wanted to ask them. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=846.0s)]
*  But it's so funny because a lot of people will hear a teacher say something like that, right? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=850.0s)]
*  And because probably teachers say that to everybody in a way. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=853.0s)]
*  But a lot of time it doesn't activate in us. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=857.0s)]
*  You know, I wonder what made it that active. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=860.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=863.0s)]
*  It's kind of interesting how this teacher spent a lot of time with me because I grew up in the city of Atlanta in the ghetto. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=864.0s)]
*  And and she would, you know, like she taught me how to read. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=870.0s)]
*  And and you know, she just instilled a lot of things in me that my mama did. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=874.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm 50 now and I still quote her to this day. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=879.0s)]
*  Wow. When I'm down and out, I said, Miss Troupe said I can do and be in the fucking thing I want to be. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=884.0s)]
*  When I went to my husband said, I'm going to be a comedian. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=888.0s)]
*  He's like, girl, because I'm a convicted felon. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=890.0s)]
*  He's like, just keep the fucking job at General Motors. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=892.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, I want to be a comedian. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=894.0s)]
*  This shit look easy. I'm having fun. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=897.0s)]
*  You get to eat because everybody start doing comedy. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=899.0s)]
*  Well, at least I did to eat the free food. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=902.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. Yes. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=904.0s)]
*  Nice. And he's like, I get to eat it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=905.0s)]
*  And you get that little tension. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=907.0s)]
*  I was like, just keep the fucking job. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=909.0s)]
*  I say, no, I'm going to be a fucking comedian. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=910.0s)]
*  Oh, no, this bitch just don't want to work. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=913.0s)]
*  That is true. A lot of comedians. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=917.0s)]
*  They because part of the temptation in the beginning is this shit does not feel like a real job. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=919.0s)]
*  It don't feels kind of if you have a natural acclamation of being making people laugh. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=924.0s)]
*  You're like, this shit is easy. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=928.0s)]
*  It's easy. It's fun. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=930.0s)]
*  You hanging out with people you like. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=932.0s)]
*  You up all night. You get them twenty, thirty dollars. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=933.0s)]
*  And, you know, them few little things, especially like if you ain't got no real bills or you are you a waiter or something and you go to your job during the day. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=936.0s)]
*  But it's so much fun at night to hang around people that you really fucking like. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=944.0s)]
*  They do what you do and you watch everybody turn that fucking happiness into a struggle. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=948.0s)]
*  What they trying to make it or trying to make this shit work for them. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=954.0s)]
*  So this is all they got to do because this is what they love to do. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=957.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, there is something that's kind of beautiful about it in that sense. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=960.0s)]
*  You know, do you think sometimes I feel like strippers? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=964.0s)]
*  I notice a similarity between strippers and comedians. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=967.0s)]
*  Do you ever feel that way a little bit? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=969.0s)]
*  I don't know. Goddamn thing about strippers. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=971.0s)]
*  I'm fatter than a motherfucker. What the fuck? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=973.0s)]
*  You think I know aliens, stripper? What's going to be next for you? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=975.0s)]
*  I don't know about I don't even go no fucking strip club. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=979.0s)]
*  I don't even like pussy. I don't like my own pussy. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=981.0s)]
*  So why am I going to look at other people? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=984.0s)]
*  You need to stay the fuck out of the strip club. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=986.0s)]
*  I don't like them either. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=989.0s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=992.0s)]
*  And what dealing you do, you ask me, I notice that comedy and pussy go together. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=994.0s)]
*  Not for me. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=999.0s)]
*  I don't know shit about no goddamn script. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1001.0s)]

*  Lizzo got shot. Didn't she? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1007.0s)]
*  She's the one that got shot or no? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  No, you're getting your black folks mixed up. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  That was Megan Thee Stallion got shot in the foot. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  Lizzo is the plus side of them. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  We'll be giving it to them on the internet with her. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1018.0s)]
*  Lizzo be throwing that thick at you, baby. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1021.0s)]

*  She look like if you grab her, she'll slip out your hand. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  Oh, you can't even get a hug on her. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  You can't even lock a hug on her. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  I don't know what kind of cocoa butter they use on Lizzo, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1042.0s)]

*  She's beautiful, bro. I love me some Lizzo. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  So why did you say you think comedy and strippers go together? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1056.0s)]
*  Because it's like putting yourself out there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  There's something about it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  You're like putting whatever you have inside of you out there. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1064.0s)]
*  Both of us naked, because once you get on stage, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1067.0s)]
*  the stripper is naked as a comedian. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  You really don't know if they're going to last, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  so you're naked too until you grab control, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  until you learn how to slide down that pole. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1079.0s)]
*  So I would agree with you a little bit, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  but I don't go to strip clubs. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  I don't want to smell that shit in the air. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's true. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  I never really, I guess, well, I remember the first time I ever went. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1088.0s)]
*  Me and my friend Lance were in Louisville, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1091.0s)]
*  and I was too young to get in, but he could get in. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1093.0s)]
*  So he'd go in and tell me what it looked like, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1096.0s)]
*  and he'd come back out and tell me, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  show me the shape of the breast with his hands and everything like that. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1100.0s)]
*  He'd come in and show me, huh, was you 10? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1104.0s)]
*  No, I was probably 16, but we tried and he wouldn't let me in, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1108.0s)]
*  so he'd just be describing everything to me, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1111.0s)]
*  and I was sitting in the car. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1114.0s)]
*  Did you get off with that? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  Had me a couple beers. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  I don't remember if I did. I probably did. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1117.0s)]
*  At 16, having a couple beers? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1119.0s)]
*  I mean, I was just in, because I had to stay in the vehicle, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1121.0s)]
*  so he went inside and he would come back out and just chill. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, you drinking beers at 16? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1129.0s)]
*  Where you from? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  I'm from Louisiana. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1131.0s)]
*  Oh, no wonder. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  Y'all do. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1133.0s)]
*  You probably bang gays, putting hickies on alligator necks at 16. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1134.0s)]
*  They definitely had a lot of, I'm trying to think, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1137.0s)]
*  we had a lot of different animals in our area, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1139.0s)]
*  because I grew up in an area that nobody had pets. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1141.0s)]
*  People just had animals, you know? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1143.0s)]
*  Like you would just see an animal in your neighborhood, you know? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1145.0s)]
*  Like a cat, or you would see somebody, or just a dog would be there, you know? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1147.0s)]
*  I didn't grow up in an area with a lot of like... [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1151.0s)]
*  Well, they gave a fuck about the animal. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1153.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, I remember the first time I ever saw a dog in somebody's house, bro, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1155.0s)]
*  and they loved it, that shit blew my mind, man. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  He said they loved it. It blew my mind. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  When I was coming up, you didn't, dogs wasn't in the house. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1165.0s)]
*  You could tie them up to a tree. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1168.0s)]
*  And I think I did that bit on my special. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1170.0s)]
*  I was like, you do that shit now, you going to fucking jail. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1172.0s)]
*  You can't tie the dogs up to the trees anymore. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  I mean, dog houses are obsolete. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1177.0s)]
*  You can't fucking use them. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1180.0s)]
*  They literally got to be treated like you. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1182.0s)]
*  And I was like, fuck you. You don't even work. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1184.0s)]
*  So why am I treating you like me? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1186.0s)]
*  Yeah, at least the dogs in Alaska and stuff, they're doing sled, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1188.0s)]
*  and they're doing work during the day. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1191.0s)]
*  But yeah, these just, a lot of local animals, bro, they really just, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1193.0s)]
*  a lot of them don't pull their weight, you know? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  Don't pull their weight. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1198.0s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1200.0s)]
*  You say they didn't have a home, so they just hanging out on the corner like the drunk. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1201.0s)]
*  That's more normal. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1205.0s)]
*  Well, once people got them inside, yeah, it definitely got a little bit weird. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1207.0s)]

*  She don't keep them long. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1399.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  They got to make it a three Thanksgiving before they really be a part of the family. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1401.0s)]
*  That makes sense, kind of. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1404.0s)]
*  I think that's realistic. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1405.0s)]
*  Do a lot of, do people keep being gay a secret more in black culture than they do, you think? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1406.0s)]
*  I mean, I only know really white culture. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1411.0s)]
*  You know, I was around black culture a lot growing up, but I wasn't black, so I could [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1414.0s)]
*  just guess, you know? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1417.0s)]
*  If you around black culture, you know black culture. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1419.0s)]
*  I didn't grow around white people, but I moved around and I realized they love leaving shit [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1423.0s)]
*  at your door, they bake for you. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1427.0s)]
*  What was your question? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1429.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of like prison a little bit. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1431.0s)]
*  They didn't bring you a baked good, you know? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1433.0s)]
*  They always bring you fucking baked goods. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1435.0s)]
*  I mean, when I live in the NNL, I'm like, God damn white people. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1437.0s)]
*  Stop bringing shit to the door. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1439.0s)]
*  We ain't even eating this shit. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1441.0s)]
*  But my neighbors were great in Plainfield, Indiana. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1443.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1446.0s)]
*  I'm going to go to the bathroom. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  My neighbors were great in Plainfield, Indiana. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  What was your question? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  Is it more secret? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1454.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's more secret. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  When I was coming up... [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1458.0s)]
*  They used to call them punks when I was coming up. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  You don't give a fuck what you say, do you? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1462.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1464.0s)]
*  That's what they called them when I was coming up. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  But like when my daughter came out, and I'm 50, so I would use the word boar dagger. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1468.0s)]
*  And she was like, mama, you can't say the word boar dagger. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1473.0s)]
*  And I'm like, why? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  Nobody says that anymore. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1477.0s)]
*  And it's just like a white person call you an inward. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1479.0s)]
*  I was like, when the fuck did they change it to that? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1481.0s)]
*  So on my sitcom, we did a whole episode about using derogatory words. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1483.0s)]
*  And you can't say stuff like... [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1489.0s)]
*  They're called lesbians. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1491.0s)]
*  A studs. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1493.0s)]
*  So you can't say boar daggers and punks. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  You lose everything. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1497.0s)]
*  Or you'll gain a lot of people that believe in just saying whatever they want. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1499.0s)]
*  That's what I think about you. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1504.0s)]
*  I think I'm a fan because she says what she wants to say. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1506.0s)]
*  I get the real her. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1509.0s)]
*  Well, I do. I do. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1511.0s)]
*  But if I find out something hurts you, I'm not going to say it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1513.0s)]
*  Like I tell you, when I moved to Indiana, to be honest with you, I had never heard of the word cunt. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1517.0s)]
*  And I was at a comedy club, and this comedian called this white lady a cunt, and she just boohooed. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1522.0s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck is a cunt? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  And why is she crying like that? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1530.0s)]
*  And one of the comedians was like, that is like a black man call you a bitch. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1532.0s)]
*  And I was like, hold on, white girl, stop crying. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  Let's whoop this motherfucker ass. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1537.0s)]
*  But I didn't know that. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1539.0s)]
*  So if I know that you, if I know something is going to hurt you, I won't say it to hurt your feelings. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1541.0s)]
*  So I'm not going to say the f-word. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1547.0s)]
*  I'm not going to call a lesbian a bull dagger because that is derogatory. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1549.0s)]
*  But if I'm at the house, my daughter might get everything. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1554.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's okay. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1557.0s)]
*  That's different. Yeah, that's different. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1559.0s)]
*  I think people don't delineate kind of what is different or what isn't different, you know? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1561.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to do anything to hurt anybody. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1565.0s)]
*  No, I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1567.0s)]
*  But words have changed. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1569.0s)]
*  I think this generation of people is a lot softer. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1571.0s)]
*  They can't take the shit we used to take. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1573.0s)]
*  When we got bullied, we just fucking got bullied and fucking dealt with it and showed the bully 20 years later when they fed and I had all the kids doing shit. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1575.0s)]
*  These kids here immediately can't take criticism and stuff like that. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  They want to jump off a fucking bridge. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1591.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1594.0s)]
*  It's like, times have changed so much where back in the day when you were working, I don't know if it was hidden from us or we just see it more now. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1595.0s)]
*  Like crybabies. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1605.0s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, because before if somebody took their life or something. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1607.0s)]
*  We didn't really hear about it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1610.0s)]
*  We didn't know. Now it's like boom. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  In your face. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1613.0s)]
*  You know, this person like why? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1614.0s)]
*  You know, life is beautiful. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1616.0s)]
*  But then mental illness was not a forefront like it is today. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1617.0s)]
*  Mental illness used to be hilarious, man. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1623.0s)]
*  You see somebody that's mentally ill, you're like, fuck, dog. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1625.0s)]
*  They really racked up. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1627.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was your uncles and you wanted to hear them talk. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1628.0s)]
*  Yeah, every uncle. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1630.0s)]
*  And every uncle was mentally ill. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1631.0s)]
*  Not every, but everybody had one. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  But a lot of them, man, 60%, 70%. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1635.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had a few that was, you know, but now you can't pick at that stuff anymore. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1638.0s)]
*  You got to say what the hell. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1642.0s)]
*  Yeah, Rodney's not doing well. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  You got to say stuff like that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1646.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1647.0s)]
*  So times just have changed. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1648.0s)]
*  You know, we have to put a we I think the world has held us to caring a little bit more. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  Caring about each other, you think? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1656.0s)]
*  We should. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1658.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's trying to get there. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1659.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good point. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1661.0s)]
*  I think it is trying to get there. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1662.0s)]
*  Do you think, oh, what was Halloween like in a black community? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  What was that? I always wonder what that's like. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  It's like I've heard comedian makes jokes about you go to the white neighborhood to get the big Snickers. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1669.0s)]
*  But it was like you just like every other Halloween. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1677.0s)]
*  I don't think I know in my community, they didn't go out on costumes like they do today. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1682.0s)]
*  And I think it had a lot to do with people couldn't afford them or they really wasn't into them. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1692.0s)]
*  And like my mother-in-law, she didn't believe in Halloween because she thought it was the devil's day. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1693.0s)]
*  Damn, yeah. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1698.0s)]
*  Because she was super Christian and shit. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1699.0s)]
*  So they wasn't allowed to go trick or treating and put on costumes and shit like that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1701.0s)]
*  But we were just going out regular clothes. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1705.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1707.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think we used to get like, oh, my dad was real old. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1710.0s)]
*  My dad was 70 when I was born. He was an old man. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1713.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was 70. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1716.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was 70. He was born in 1910, right? So he was real old. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1717.0s)]
*  So he. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1721.0s)]
*  How the hell did that happen? Your mom was selling pussy? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1722.0s)]
*  No, she was just giving it out. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1725.0s)]
*  And how was your mother? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1727.0s)]
*  Thirty two. My mother was thirty two. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1729.0s)]
*  Was your daddy rich? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1731.0s)]
*  No. And that's the crazy part. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1732.0s)]
*  Was he in Tennessee? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  No, they was in Louisiana. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1737.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1740.0s)]
*  Your mama fucked a 90 year old man. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1741.0s)]
*  I mean, 70. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1743.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 70. And he was handsome guy. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1744.0s)]
*  But how long was he around after he was born? Two weeks? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1747.0s)]
*  Eighty six. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1749.0s)]
*  Your mama gave birth to your dad to die. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1755.0s)]
*  God damn. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  It felt like it, man. He was there every time. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1762.0s)]
*  Every day I saw him like, damn, he's getting smaller and smaller. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1764.0s)]
*  He about to meet me in the middle. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1767.0s)]
*  That's what I felt like. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1769.0s)]
*  Your daddy was 86. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1770.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1772.0s)]
*  How old was you when he died? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1773.0s)]
*  Sixteen. So I was getting pretty old. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1774.0s)]
*  But Jesus fucking Christ. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1778.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it was. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1780.0s)]
*  Why your mama say she did? I'm interested. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1781.0s)]
*  Why your mama would fuck somebody that old? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  Did she need her fucking trailer paid for or some shit? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1785.0s)]
*  I don't know what she needed. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1788.0s)]
*  My mother doesn't say anything about it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1790.0s)]
*  Yes, she doesn't say anything about it. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1791.0s)]
*  Is you the only child? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1793.0s)]
*  Of course you the only child. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1794.0s)]
*  No, we got four children. I got two younger sisters. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1795.0s)]
*  Not by that old man? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1797.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1798.0s)]
*  Not by that old man? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1799.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1800.0s)]
*  You might need to check your DNA. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1801.0s)]
*  I guarantee you that was a younger nigga up the street. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1802.0s)]
*  A younger person up the street, baby. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1805.0s)]
*  And your mama, she just put it on that old man because he was taking care of the house. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1807.0s)]
*  Maybe. I don't know. He wasn't taking care of much, man. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1810.0s)]
*  Dude, the best things I'm trying to think. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1812.0s)]
*  My dad bought a Cutlass, right? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1815.0s)]
*  Because we lived in like a black and white neighborhood. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1817.0s)]
*  So my dad bought a Cutlass from a couple of brothers around the corner from us. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1819.0s)]
*  And it had like 22s in the trunk, right? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1823.0s)]
*  So he and he was he couldn't even hear, right? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1825.0s)]
*  So he would drive around listening to Paul Harvey. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1829.0s)]
*  You remember that guy on the radio who did like the weather report? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1832.0s)]
*  It is like Paul Harvey, like the old dude. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1835.0s)]
*  He would listen to it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1838.0s)]
*  We just had a ton of bass, though. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1840.0s)]
*  It'd be like the weather and like it was like AM radio and shit. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1842.0s)]
*  He would listen to Rush Limbaugh just boom. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1846.0s)]
*  Your dad was a Rush Limbaugh person. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1849.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he would listen to it with like a ton of bass, though. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1851.0s)]
*  It's different when you hear it with bass. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1853.0s)]
*  I bet it is. He's screaming. He's screaming to a beat. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1855.0s)]
*  But it was a little bit different. That was interesting, I guess. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1861.0s)]
*  You can't get over your daddy. Who's your granddad? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1865.0s)]
*  Oh, my grandfather was born in 1880, which is crazy. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1868.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1871.0s)]
*  Him and your daddy went to school together. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1872.0s)]
*  Was he alive when you were born? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1874.0s)]
*  No, no, he was gone. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1876.0s)]
*  That's the only reason why your daddy got your mama because your granddad had already died. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1878.0s)]
*  Shit, I've heard fucking for rent money, but that's a little that's fucking for Social Security. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1883.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the crazy part. I was like, who's fucked? Why? I wouldn't. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1888.0s)]
*  I just didn't understand. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1892.0s)]
*  Your mama's still alive? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1893.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's still alive. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1894.0s)]
*  Don't tell me she got another old man. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1895.0s)]
*  No, she married another guy, but he was only 20 years older, but he ended up passing away. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1897.0s)]
*  Everybody die with your mama too, though. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1902.0s)]
*  Shit. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1904.0s)]
*  Your mama like that soft dick. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1907.0s)]
*  She got like soft dick. How the fuck a 17-year-old woman get? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1910.0s)]
*  I don't know. Do, yeah, I guess maybe people's penises get softer over time. I don't know. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1915.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. I just know how much. I mean, I know how, you know, my own penis over my own time, but I don't. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1923.0s)]
*  How old are you, Theo? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1930.0s)]
*  I'm 40 years old. I'm 41. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1931.0s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1933.0s)]
*  Damn. I don't want that, man. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1934.0s)]
*  Nobody wants it, but it can't stay hard forever. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1938.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1941.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, if that's your daddy, your mama's swallowed. I don't mean to be mean. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1942.0s)]
*  I just don't see no 70-year-old man back. What even no Viagra to help your daddy out back then? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1947.0s)]
*  So if they had no Viagra, he was doing that on sheer willpower, and there's something beautiful about that. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1954.0s)]
*  No, ain't no 70-year-old man. You lying, Theo. That ain't your daddy. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1958.0s)]
*  I swear to God, it is. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1962.0s)]
*  I'm telling them brothers sold your daddy that car might be your daddy. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1963.0s)]
*  Because you talk like a brother, too. You just got that Joe Durkowski. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1968.0s)]
*  I got a big ass, baby. I do have kind of a big ass. I will say that. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1971.0s)]
*  Black men ain't got no big ass. I'm just saying, you might need to check your DNA. You might be a little bit of black. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1975.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. I'll take a little. Yeah, I'll take a little if I could get it. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1981.0s)]
*  I wonder how you get that white kid that gets really obsessed with black culture. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1985.0s)]
*  It's funner. It's the cool thing to do. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1990.0s)]
*  And I felt like those kids. I just like rewrote on the same bus. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1995.0s)]
*  It's funny because you said your daddy listened to Rush Limbaugh. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=1999.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that was him. That's because I think that was just another senior citizen. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2003.0s)]
*  He didn't try to spill that over into your life? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2007.0s)]
*  No, he wasn't. No, my dad wasn't racist. I think he was just a Republican, but he wasn't like a racist guy. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2010.0s)]
*  Our family wasn't like Redneck or anything. My dad was from Nicaragua and my mom was from Illinois. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2017.0s)]
*  Well, how the fuck you end up with these Redneck haircut? It only look good on you. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2024.0s)]
*  You've been rocking that shit for a long time. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2029.0s)]
*  I like that. You're coming around now. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2032.0s)]
*  You remind me of vanilla ice. Ice, ice, baby. I used to love that fucking song. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2034.0s)]
*  It was good, huh? Well, I heard you talking about you used to watch Leave It to Beaver. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2042.0s)]
*  I grew up watching. Yeah, I used to like live through the television shows. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2045.0s)]
*  So how do you think if you grew up in such an environment that was probably so dangerous, what do you really think? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2049.0s)]
*  I know you talked about that teacher. It wasn't dangerous. It was poor. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2054.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2056.0s)]
*  Because you got to think if you know black culture. Back in those days, we wasn't all of these black on black violence wasn't happening. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  It didn't happen to crack hit the black community. Yeah. Then this shit happened. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2066.0s)]
*  So when I was growing up, it was crazy. It was just poverty. It was just poverty. That's what it was. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2070.0s)]
*  You know, when you when you poor like that as a kid, you really don't know you poor until you grow up and then look at society. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2077.0s)]
*  Because a lot of shit I didn't really learn that was wrong until I became to open my mouth about it. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2085.0s)]
*  I became a comedian. I was like, people like I grew up like that. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2091.0s)]
*  And I was like, you didn't grow up like that. Your mom cook in the fireplace. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2095.0s)]
*  What the fuck? Your mom is cooking in the fire. Can we have no gas? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  You saw. So, you know, it was just poverty. We were just poor as hell. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2102.0s)]
*  Yeah. Being poor creates the most fun, though, because you got to be around each other more. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2107.0s)]
*  You don't have things to occupy your time. I think you see more shit. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  You do see more shit. You learn something called survivor. Yeah. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2115.0s)]
*  Less stuff is hidden from you. So I think when you're wealthy, you get to hide more. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2120.0s)]
*  You hide from other people. You can hide more from you get hedges. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2124.0s)]
*  You get a yard. You get distance between you get separate bedrooms. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2128.0s)]
*  You get all these things where like everything is kind of hidden. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2132.0s)]
*  We had hedges. They were just walked on. We had a yard. We just walked down. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2136.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, Theo. We had everything rich people had. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2143.0s)]
*  It just didn't look as good as they shit did. Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2146.0s)]
*  And we just cooked in a fireplace. But yeah, I think when you wealthy, you know, a lot more is given. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2149.0s)]
*  You know, and when you poor, you got to earn a lot more. Yeah. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2158.0s)]
*  Even with my kids, I mean, I'm not rich and no shit like that. But you know, but y'all getting fancy. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2162.0s)]

*  Well, they don't have the same struggle because this struggle ain't there no more. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2172.0s)]
*  So is I have to learn to say no. I was like, go get your own shit. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2176.0s)]

*  And which one was probably the was it given birth? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2205.0s)]
*  Do you tell me about that? Do you ever have any crazy given birthdays like days where you had to go to the hospital and give birth? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2209.0s)]
*  Because I know you had a wild you had like a while you've had a wild life, you know, very wild compared to a lot of folks. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2215.0s)]
*  Well, I my first one I had at 14, that was really easy. She popped out. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  I can't even think about that. It feels illegal for me to even think about that birthday. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2225.0s)]
*  I can't even look at pictures from that. That's crazy. I know. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2231.0s)]
*  Right. But I gave birth at 14 and that was the easiest pregnant ever. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2234.0s)]
*  I mean, she literally popped out and I was riding my bicycles in three days. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2238.0s)]
*  Wow. So how big was she? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2242.0s)]
*  She was nine pounds and my last child was ten. So he really hurt. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2245.0s)]
*  And he always been like that kind of a pain a little. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2250.0s)]
*  Well, you know, a lot of parents don't tell you this, but I always tell them I said I love all of my kids, but every parent got a favorite kid. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2253.0s)]
*  And then last one is my favorite. Yeah. And you tell it. Oh, yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2260.0s)]
*  I tell them I say I love all y'all, but this one is my favorite. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2264.0s)]
*  What makes him a favorite? I think because he was the last one. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  He was ten, too. And that my husband didn't have any kids when I met him. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2271.0s)]
*  So he took care of my two kids and my sister four kids. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2276.0s)]
*  And then I had a daughter by him. And then when I had my last one was a boy and I wanted to name it after him. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2279.0s)]
*  I kind of think that's why June Bug is my favorite because he's a junior. Oh, yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2285.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had a June Bug bus growing up. We had a kid named June Bug. June Bug was everywhere. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2290.0s)]
*  Everybody got a June Bug. Oh, really? I think so. Yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2295.0s)]

*  but I had Theo and I got to meet Malcolm Jamal Warner one time and I told him that my name was Theo. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2303.0s)]
*  He didn't really care, but that's all right. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2308.0s)]
*  That's all right. I told my name was Theo. He really cared. Why should he care? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2312.0s)]
*  OK, what the fuck you want me to do? Because you. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2317.0s)]

*  What the fuck you want me to say? We are saying that your daddy 99. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2324.0s)]

*  You just gonna set it on your parquet like he holds on this to your parquet, okay? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2547.0s)]
*  I don't think, I mean, I'm still looking, you know. I'm still looking. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2551.0s)]
*  How'd you know when you met your husband that he was the one? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2555.0s)]
*  He had a good job back teeth and he didn't hit bitches in the eye on Friday. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2558.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2562.0s)]
*  But I knew he was the one. He was a nice guy. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2563.0s)]
*  Did you know him right from the beginning or it took a little few dates? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2565.0s)]
*  I liked him. So, you know, he just came over and we went out a couple of times, but I liked him when I first saw him. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2568.0s)]
*  What can a man do you think, if out of the gate he's kind of like in that gray zone, what can he do on that second, third date to maybe get himself into a better zone, you think? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2576.0s)]
*  What do you mean by gray zone, like if you're not liking him? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2586.0s)]
*  You're just not sure maybe. You're kind of like him. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2588.0s)]
*  Well, you're never not sure when you meet somebody. I think the more, the conversation. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2590.0s)]
*  A person can learn a lot about you through your conversation. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2594.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're listening good, some women get swindled through conversations because some men don't know how to say all the right shit. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2598.0s)]
*  Or when you hang up their phone, you gotta take a step back like, oh, what this motherfucker up to? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2606.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2610.0s)]
*  You know, and then times have changed so much now. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2611.0s)]
*  Motherfucker give you their name. You can call a girlfriend like my friend, Queesha. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2615.0s)]
*  Bitch, put this motherfucker name in this thing and tell me more about this person. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2619.0s)]
*  It'll bring up everything about them. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2623.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to hide now. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2625.0s)]
*  It's hard to hide now. So, I mean, you just can't be goo goo gaga over somebody the first, sometime the first fucking year. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2627.0s)]
*  You just gotta keep talking and see if it grows. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2635.0s)]
*  Do you think, sometimes I feel like black people don't get that nervous. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2639.0s)]
*  I always feel like black people don't get nervous. Do you feel like black people get nervous or not? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2643.0s)]
*  We human? What the fuck you think we are animals? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2647.0s)]
*  No, I don't think that at all. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2650.0s)]
*  Black people don't get nervous. What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2652.0s)]
*  A lot of my black friends, they never seem like they get nervous. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2655.0s)]
*  Nervous about what? You don't get nervous? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2657.0s)]
*  Anything. I get nervous. I get nervous a lot. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2659.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2661.0s)]
*  So, I'm also a person that gets extra nervous. So, then I think I'm more prone to maybe thinking that some people don't get nervous. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2662.0s)]
*  You probably think, I think it's not the word nervous. You probably think we, is he thinking we badass? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2668.0s)]
*  Or we just like, we don't give a fuck? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2678.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is. Maybe we don't get scared? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2681.0s)]
*  Maybe it's a mix of some of those things. And so then it comes off to me like that. Oh, my black friends don't get nervous. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2684.0s)]
*  We get nervous? Let us get pulled over by the police. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2689.0s)]
*  You got that right. We get nervous. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2693.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's a good point. That's a real game. Yeah, once that shit happens, man, that shit is. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2696.0s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2702.0s)]
*  No whammies. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2704.0s)]
*  No what? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2705.0s)]
*  No whammies, I was saying. It's like a game show. That shit is a dangerous game show if you get pulled over by the cops, man. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2706.0s)]
*  But not for all cops, because I'm not the one to say all cops are bad cops. I try to tell people all the time, you can't let that one person throw that whole race of people off. That's not fair. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2711.0s)]
*  Yeah, because there's a lot of good guys and then people come at them with a bad energy and shit. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2723.0s)]
*  It's like when the guy from, he might be your friend, but from who was on XM radio. What's his name? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2727.0s)]
*  Oh, well. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2734.0s)]
*  He was on XM radio. They was on for years. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2738.0s)]
*  Opie and Anthony? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2741.0s)]
*  Yeah, wasn't it Opie or Anthony that cussed out the black woman? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2742.0s)]
*  I'm not sure which one. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2746.0s)]
*  Remember she made the video? One of them made the video. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2747.0s)]
*  It might be Anthony. Anthony's more volatile. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2749.0s)]
*  Yeah, so he made the video saying black women or something and all he had to say was that bitch he had an incident with was the problem. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2752.0s)]
*  But when you throw a whole, when you throw all black women in it, then it becomes a problem because I'm not that lady who cussed you out. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2762.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2768.0s)]
*  So why are you throwing my race because you dealt with somebody that we are the same race. That's not fair. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2769.0s)]
*  If a white boy run up and rape me, I'm not going to say all white boys rape. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2775.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2781.0s)]
*  That's not fair. I mean, because you wouldn't rape me, would you? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2782.0s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2784.0s)]
*  Why you say um first? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2786.0s)]
*  That ain't how you ask a rape question. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2787.0s)]
*  I mean, I wanted to really, you know. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2790.0s)]
*  You had to think twice? God damn. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2792.0s)]
*  No ma'am, I would not be raping. I ain't doing no raping. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2794.0s)]
*  Okay, so. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2796.0s)]
*  I'm not even that good at sex. I'd be the worst rapist ever. I mean, I absolutely would be the worst. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2797.0s)]
*  Well most of them are worse than sex. That's why they take it and they force their shit on you. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2800.0s)]
*  But so I just think, I just think you cannot throw stuff on people because one person, individuals did it. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2805.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2813.0s)]
*  It doesn't make everybody that race the same way. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2814.0s)]
*  How long were you doing comedy before you, before something started to turn and you're like, oh wow, this is going to be good? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2817.0s)]
*  Because I've seen you go through the clubs for a long time. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2822.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2824.0s)]
*  Probably 12, 13 years, maybe 15 at the most. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2826.0s)]
*  And what was the thing that started to kind of, when do you start to see, oh something's changing here? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2831.0s)]
*  I moved to Indiana, which I thought my life was going to be fucking over. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2836.0s)]
*  And so I ended up getting on a tour with Cat Williams, the Catapothelist Tour. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2841.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2847.0s)]
*  Right after I moved there, Cat paid me fucking like a shit ton of money to do 15 minutes a night. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2849.0s)]
*  And then I ended up going on a road with RNSJ and D. Ray Davis and I just kept grinding. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2856.0s)]
*  But I knew by me being on that Cat tour, I did festivals and shit like that that had really helped me out. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2863.0s)]
*  Because Ray Grant, was he on there too or no? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2872.0s)]
*  Ray Grant was on the one I was on. He's on all of them. But he was on that one I was on. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2874.0s)]
*  I just felt like, that's when I thought a lot of shit started to kind of change for me. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2878.0s)]
*  And along with festivals, I stayed going to the festivals even if I wasn't invited. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2883.0s)]
*  Like Montreal, because you know, as a young comic you automatically think, oh if I go to Montreal, if I just get new faces, my whole life's going to change. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2888.0s)]
*  That is bullshit. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2895.0s)]
*  I try to tell you, I say, hey, just go over there and do the fucking jokes. It's a goddamn, it's a good time. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2897.0s)]
*  It's a good time. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2902.0s)]
*  I remember the year I went and it was the year of the white boys. So white boys was really hot. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2904.0s)]
*  But I didn't realize that until after I was there. And it was after this, everybody was all up this Canadian comedian ass, which I didn't think was funny. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2909.0s)]
*  But I didn't know, I'm a young comic so I don't know what the industry is looking for. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2918.0s)]
*  And I did my sit and nobody said anything to me. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2922.0s)]
*  But when they tell you, oh my God, the industry is going to be all over you, you're going to do this, you're going to do that, nobody talks to me. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2926.0s)]
*  I remember going back to my hotel room and crying because everybody told me if I go over there I was going to blow the fuck up. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2932.0s)]
*  Then I had to realize this shit is a process and it might not never happen. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2938.0s)]
*  So I just started to focus on my comedy and when I got invited to shit I would show up and I just learned to take the feelings out of it. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2945.0s)]
*  Because when you got feelings out of it, you will fucking go crazy. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2954.0s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2959.0s)]
*  Not getting invited to those things and thinking, man, I'm never going to have a chance. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2961.0s)]
*  This industry doesn't like me. This whole world doesn't. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2965.0s)]
*  That I'm not a part of it. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2969.0s)]
*  Was you a new face? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2972.0s)]
*  No. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2973.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2974.0s)]
*  I never was, yeah. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2975.0s)]
*  And then it started to get, now it's about diversity and a lot of trans, comedian, gay, it's a lot of that now. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2976.0s)]
*  And I don't need it now. I'm in my own kind of world now. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2983.0s)]
*  Once podcasts had started people could create their own worlds. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2987.0s)]
*  Yeah, they could. They really could. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2989.0s)]
*  I just think it's more about diversity. It's a lot about diversity. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2991.0s)]
*  I think the industry was forced to listen to what everybody had to say. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=2997.0s)]
*  Yeah, well you need more voices. At a certain point you kind of have heard a lot of the same voices. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3002.0s)]
*  Yeah, because let's be honest. If it's a white girl it's the same slutty white girl thing. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3006.0s)]
*  And then I've seen so many other white female comedians that wasn't slutty but wasn't getting pushed to the top. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3011.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well this bitch is funny. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3018.0s)]
*  But when you slutty it was like they'll push you to the top. And everybody knew that at the time. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3021.0s)]
*  So I just think it's what the industry believed that the voice that they're looking for that season. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3029.0s)]
*  Well I've always thought Earthquake I've always thought is one of the best comedians. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3036.0s)]
*  Oh he's so fucking funny. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3040.0s)]
*  I mean who kills a room, who kills a room. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3043.0s)]
*  I've always said Earthquake is probably one of the top three that I've seen who kills a room. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3046.0s)]
*  And to finally see him getting a Netflix special and just things that make him feel deserved. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3051.0s)]
*  Because part of it is making him feel like you deserve, not you deserve, but just like a thing where it's like you've earned this. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3058.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3067.0s)]
*  A piece of him can be like, okay I have. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3068.0s)]
*  I mean because we as comics, let's be real, we sit at the house and we're like, how this motherfucker get this? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3070.0s)]
*  This motherfucker ain't even funny. You said behind the door, who the fuck pushing this person? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3076.0s)]
*  So that's what I mean when I say I learned to take the feelings out of it. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3080.0s)]
*  So now I say, oh well, you know, maybe more black girls will get specials. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3084.0s)]
*  I was so happy when they gave Tiffany that special and Monique made all of that noise about the pay of women and stuff. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3090.0s)]
*  And you know, I was happy because I'm going to be honest, I think Netflix started to give more black women stuff after that. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3099.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3110.0s)]
*  You know, where I didn't see a lot of black females getting specials, especially ones that stepped outside of the box. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3111.0s)]
*  So when she- [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3118.0s)]
*  That's a good point, huh? I never even thought about that. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3119.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then you know, I don't know what Tiffany got paid, but I heard she got paid really good. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3122.0s)]
*  I mean, they was really good to me too. So, you know, I just think it made them pay attention. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3126.0s)]
*  Hey, you it's not enough diversity on your platform, which they they turn it around and they put a lot of diversity on it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3132.0s)]
*  You know, I like when I see a gay or trans or black or white or Hispanic or any Asian comedian. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3146.0s)]
*  That means it's a little bit something. It's something out there for everybody. It's like a gumbo. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3150.0s)]
*  Instead of just one straight way. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3151.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3153.0s)]
*  You know, I used to think about that when I was young. It would be like, actually a lot of my favorite shows. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3154.0s)]
*  It was like, I mean, what did they have? Like, I mean, I loved a lot of my favorite sitcoms and stuff were black shows, you know. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3159.0s)]
*  Good Times, The Jeffersons. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3168.0s)]
*  Yeah. What was Family Matters? People love that show. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3170.0s)]
*  Yeah, people love that show. My show is, the show that I do, the Miss Pat Show, it's kind of like, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3174.0s)]
*  they want to say a Roseanne because I'm a plus size woman like Roseanne. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3181.0s)]
*  But I think it's more like Archie Bunker. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3186.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3190.0s)]
*  That type of honesty. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3191.0s)]
*  All in the family, that one? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3193.0s)]
*  Yeah, all in the family. I have a lot of learning moments like him. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3199.0s)]
*  So, but sometimes I'm shooting and I tell my co-creator Jordan Cooper, I said, it feels like Martin's. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3200.0s)]
*  Then it feels like a Bernie Mac. So it's a little bit of a mix of everything. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3208.0s)]
*  Well, you look like Gina from Martin a little bit, the lady that played in that show. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3212.0s)]
*  Really? I've never heard that one. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3215.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3217.0s)]
*  Mike, the father on the show, wife, looks a lot like her to me. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3218.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3222.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3223.0s)]
*  We have a couple questions that came in. Do you want to pull something up, Colin? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3224.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3227.0s)]
*  Hey, what's up, Miss Pat? What's up, Theo? My question is for Miss Pat. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3228.0s)]
*  I was a photographer at Skankfest last November and Miss Pat was there and so was the great Bob Saget. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3233.0s)]
*  And, you know, Miss Pat and Bob talk a lot about their friendship and their relationship on podcasts during the week and stuff. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3240.0s)]
*  But I was just wondering, is there a favorite moment you have, Miss Pat, or a favorite story about Bob that you have? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3247.0s)]
*  We'd love to hear it. Thanks, guys. Gang, gang. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3255.0s)]
*  Gang, baby. Thanks for the question, man. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3257.0s)]
*  Yeah, Bob Saget came to my house for dinner. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3261.0s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3264.0s)]
*  I did Bob Saget podcast. And when we locked off and, you know, I found out, I said, you playing in Indy, I live here. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3265.0s)]
*  He's like, why don't I come to your house for dinner? And I'm like, what the fuck? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3273.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, you want to come to my motherfucking house for dinner? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3277.0s)]
*  And so he really threw me off and I'm like, okay. And so I didn't really know if he was going to come. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3280.0s)]
*  So and at the time I'm in Atlanta trying to buy a house and get our stuff together. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3286.0s)]
*  I had a gig and I had to get rid of that date that Bob Saget that Thursday because I was not going to tell Bob Saget he could not come to my fucking house. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3290.0s)]
*  So I just I went home and I cleaned up. I called the housekeeping. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3297.0s)]
*  My husband's like, what the fuck is going on? I have a really famous person coming to the house, but I can't tell you who it is because I didn't know Bob Saget was going to show the fuck up like you did. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3300.0s)]
*  You know how famous people stand you up. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3307.0s)]
*  And then they was like, well, who's coming? And I would never tell them who came. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3309.0s)]
*  And I just say, wait till they ring the doorbell and everybody trying to figure out who coming. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3313.0s)]
*  He rings the doorbell. He got flowers in his hand and wine. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3317.0s)]
*  They was like, Bob Saget. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3321.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. And we sat there and I wish I had a video the whole thing. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3326.0s)]
*  When I tell you he was so fucking funny and you know, you think it Bob Saget, you know, the clean Bob Saget from the sitcom, corny as fuck. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3331.0s)]
*  You know, you know, you know, I've seen his stand up. I knew a stand up was funny. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3340.0s)]
*  I just think that he was so fucking quick with he was like just cracking the fuck. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3344.0s)]
*  He had us cracking up like seriously. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3349.0s)]
*  And then we my son barbecue because my son June Buck can barbecue really well. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3351.0s)]
*  So I like you, but you're going to barbecue and Gary Allen is going to make it. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3355.0s)]
*  So who the fuck? I shut the fuck up. I said, just cook the food and I can't cook. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3358.0s)]
*  So we made this barbecue about steaks and, you know, I'm like, I don't know the fuck. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3362.0s)]
*  You know, rich people eat or how they eat. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3368.0s)]
*  So I just went out and bought the best of everything. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3371.0s)]
*  And Bob Saget ate a plate. Oh, my God. This shit is so fucking good. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3373.0s)]
*  He got up and went and fixed this stuff. Another plate sat out and then he did. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3377.0s)]
*  I was like, hold on, Bob. You want to buy groceries, motherfucker. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3382.0s)]
*  He's like, he's been a long time since I had food this good. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3385.0s)]
*  Miss Bella, what the fuck have you been? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3389.0s)]
*  And he was there for about four or five hours. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3391.0s)]
*  And we left at that table and we talked. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3394.0s)]
*  And that's my that's my most memorable moment with him. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3397.0s)]
*  Wow, that's wild. That's amazing. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3400.0s)]
*  Yeah. And your family, your kids were there, too. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3403.0s)]
*  My whole family was there. I flew. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3405.0s)]
*  I flew my the girl who do my hair and I was like, he might not come because I told her who he was. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3408.0s)]
*  But I didn't tell my family. And we just waited. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3414.0s)]
*  He rung that door, but he got in an Uber. They got out the fucking Uber like a nice Uber, regular one. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3416.0s)]
*  It was a regular little Uber. I don't even think the person who picked Bob Saget up knew they were Bob Saget because he had a mask on. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3422.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3428.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3430.0s)]
*  And so we take some pictures and I post them and everybody's like, Bob Saget was in our neighborhood. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3431.0s)]
*  Oh, that's my most memorable moment. I tell you, when I found out he passed, I couldn't stop crying. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3438.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because it was such a building relationship. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3444.0s)]
*  Bob Saget would literally text me in the middle of the night, how you doing, Pat? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3447.0s)]
*  And I just talked to him because I had asked Bob to be on my show and my show was on BET Plus and Paramount Plus. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3451.0s)]
*  And I know Bob ain't never been on BET. So I said, I'm going to ask him. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3459.0s)]
*  I said, would you come and play a role on the show? He's like, fuck yeah, I'm there. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3463.0s)]
*  So we were literally talking about him doing a role on the show. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3467.0s)]
*  And the week he died, I had just texted him and said, send it up. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3472.0s)]
*  He's telling me who to reach out to and I got you, Pat. I'm going to do it. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3478.0s)]
*  And I was leaving a Falcon game and my son called and said, they said, Bob Saget died. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3482.0s)]
*  And I called and there was no answer. And I was like, this can't be real. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3488.0s)]
*  And I literally fucking cried. I was like, because I really liked it. He was so fucking genuine. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3494.0s)]
*  He was just a genuine guy. And I'm the type of person like, I don't give a fuck who you are or what you've done. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3501.0s)]
*  If you're a good person, then I fuck with you. And he was a good person. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3507.0s)]
*  Wow. Man, that's what kind of makes me sad. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3512.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was a good person. And sometimes I go back and I look at it. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3516.0s)]
*  And I started seeing people posting their text messages between them and Bob Saget. I was like, I would never do that. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3520.0s)]
*  Some of that's a little weird. I think showing some support is one thing. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3528.0s)]
*  Trying to relate too much. I don't know. When people do that shit, they over relate. That shit to me is so cringy. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3531.0s)]
*  Well, you want clout online too. I would never show something that private because you died. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3536.0s)]
*  To go and show people my text message between me and Bob Saget. I just, I wouldn't do that. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3542.0s)]
*  And then like I had an actress on the show that committed suicide who played the secretary. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3548.0s)]
*  And I had just talked to her a week before and she was about to return to the show. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3554.0s)]
*  And that shit just hit me like a brick because she was like my baby. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3559.0s)]
*  I don't know. When I meet people, because I grew up like not a close knit family. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3564.0s)]
*  And I just started to collect people as family members. And she was like a family member to me. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3572.0s)]
*  And you know, about three weeks ago she was here. She was missing. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3580.0s)]
*  And then they found her. They said she committed suicide. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3584.0s)]
*  Did you have any inkling when you saw her? Did she seem down? You could have no idea. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3589.0s)]
*  I don't, you know, you don't really. I had a nervous energy to me. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3593.0s)]
*  Like always something wrong. She didn't want to disappoint people. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3598.0s)]
*  And I was talking to her about a role and I was like that role is too small. You're too fucking good. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3602.0s)]
*  So look, I'm gonna bring you in for this role. And we back and forth. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3605.0s)]
*  And I come off stage and I got this long ass text. I called her and I said, you okay? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3608.0s)]
*  And she's like, I just don't want to disappoint you. And I was like, Lindsay, I fucking love you. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3612.0s)]
*  And you know, no, no, you know. And I was like, just wait. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3616.0s)]
*  And the week she killed herself was the week she was supposed to be on my fucking show. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3619.0s)]
*  That was the episode she was going to come in for. But I told her it was too small. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3622.0s)]
*  I was going to bring in for the next one. So we literally writing her in the next one. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3625.0s)]
*  And as I come off stage, they said she was missing. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3629.0s)]
*  And I talked to another one of the actors from L.A. on my show. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3634.0s)]
*  And then they were two days later, they said she was dead. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3638.0s)]
*  And I was like, I can't believe she did this. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3642.0s)]
*  That's scary. Yeah, it's very scary. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3645.0s)]
*  You know, because I mean, because I sometimes I beat myself. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3649.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck if I had just given her that small role that she could have been there with me and she wouldn't have killed herself. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3653.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have a good there's a guy like who used to hit me up. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3660.0s)]
*  I met him through skydiving. Right. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3663.0s)]
*  I met him at a comedy show one time and he said, hey, man, I'm such a big fan. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3665.0s)]
*  I can relate to you on certain levels like how you feel about a lot of things. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3668.0s)]
*  And we swap numbers. He invited me to go skydiving. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3672.0s)]
*  So I went down there one time, took my little I had a girlfriend at the time and she was a good girl. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3675.0s)]
*  And we went skydiving. And then a couple of like months after that, he'd been messaging me. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3679.0s)]
*  But I hadn't I just hadn't noticed. I'd just been busy and I just hadn't noticed. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3684.0s)]
*  And he sent like three texts over a couple of months and then he killed himself. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3688.0s)]
*  And sometimes I think, damn, man, if I just said my life had been a little slower or something, you know, if I hadn't been thinking about myself, then I'm not saying I could have saved him. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3691.0s)]
*  But maybe I could have just you just don't know sometimes how what people are needing. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3701.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, some people, some people just need somebody to listen sometimes. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3706.0s)]
*  So I have a and I don't have a lot a lot of time like I used to because I'm so busy with TV show radio and just trying to create other shit where I try to take out the time. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3710.0s)]
*  Like if I'm waking up at four o'clock in the morning, I don't really have to be up because my mind wake me up at that time. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3721.0s)]
*  I scroll through my messages and I see a lot of people that need talking. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3726.0s)]
*  And if I can't say a lot, I was like, love you. Take care. How are you doing? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3732.0s)]
*  And I answer back. I try to as much as I can. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3736.0s)]
*  But with a growing career, I mean, I hope I get as big as Dave Chappelle and Kevin Hart one day. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3739.0s)]
*  But I do take time to when they message me. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3745.0s)]
*  When I can't to say something back. Yeah, because sometimes people just need an ear. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3749.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's crazy how we have so much communication now, but nobody really taking time really to listen. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3755.0s)]
*  Nobody's really available in a lot of ways. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3761.0s)]
*  Or we all feel like we also need to tell somebody instead of hear them. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3764.0s)]
*  You know, I noticed that a lot. We feel this compulsion. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3769.0s)]
*  I think since we have so many ways to put things out there that we have to put things that we have to have to tell them. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3772.0s)]
*  You know, I have to instead of like, listen, I don't know. I don't know that much. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3778.0s)]
*  Yeah. Is that another question? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3786.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got one more question that came in. Oh, I'm gonna start this question. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3790.0s)]
*  She had somebody else park and it was kind of cute. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3794.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's nice. And people can, you know, if they get specific, they can really have something for you. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3796.0s)]
*  Got a question here from Miss Pat. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3802.0s)]
*  If you had three options to marry one of these comedians and live with for the rest of your entire life between your boy, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3805.0s)]
*  Theo Von, everyone's favorite fat alcoholic comedian, Bert Kreischer, or the slept king himself, Bobby Lee. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3814.0s)]
*  Who are you taking Miss Pat? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3824.0s)]
*  Yeah, I believe you can handle that little Vietnamese treat. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3826.0s)]
*  That little egg roll. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3829.0s)]
*  You can handle that little shrimp salad, baby. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3830.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3832.0s)]
*  Can you handle that, huh? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3835.0s)]
*  I'm gonna have to choose. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3837.0s)]
*  Now you look good in that picture right there, Theo Von. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3839.0s)]
*  If you think I look good in that, then something you done changed because something wrong with you now. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3842.0s)]
*  But I'm gonna have to go with Bert Kreischer. Bert got that long paper. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3847.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's a good point. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3850.0s)]
*  Bert look like he can buy my wigs and y'all can't. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3851.0s)]
*  And we look like we're wearing wigs. That's the crazy part. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3854.0s)]
*  But what about Bobby? Ever date a low Asian man or anything? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3857.0s)]
*  I ain't never dated a high Asian man. I'm not gonna sign my damn raise. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3860.0s)]
*  You haven't? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3862.0s)]
*  There's definitely not no fucking Asian. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3863.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3864.0s)]
*  I've seen Bobby Lee dick too. That don't probably want that shit. That shit's so small like a toothpick. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3865.0s)]
*  Yeah, that thing really don't even look like you can do nothing. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3869.0s)]
*  He got baby nuts. So you know. He ain't busting no nuts. He peeing inside of you. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3871.0s)]
*  Yeah. It look like his dick crying a little. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3879.0s)]
*  You know the Asian people, they say, what are those little wooden shoes to keep their feet from growing? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3883.0s)]
*  Look, he stuck his dick in one. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3889.0s)]
*  It ain't gonna have to be Bert Kreischer for me, baby. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3891.0s)]
*  Damn, alright. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3896.0s)]
*  I seen Berghaus too. And Bert like them Southern girl because his wife from the same place I'm from Atlanta. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3898.0s)]
*  Is she really? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3904.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3905.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's beautiful. She's a sweetheart. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3906.0s)]
*  But you do look like an actress, an actor in that picture, Theo. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3907.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3911.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think about sometimes doing some acting, but I don't know, podcasting and touring kind of keeps me so busy, you know. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3912.0s)]
*  Did you always want to be an actress though? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3917.0s)]
*  No. I just, I love comedy. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3919.0s)]
*  Because acting's a different thing. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3922.0s)]
*  It's a different beast. You know, my show was created through Fox and Lee Daniel and Ron Howell and Brian Grazer. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3924.0s)]
*  So they immediately got me an acting coach and it took five years to get that show up and on TV because Hulu shot the pilot, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3931.0s)]
*  dropped it and then BET Plus picked it up and then Paramount, it just went over to Paramount Plus. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3941.0s)]
*  So they just, they put a lot of money into me learning how to act. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3947.0s)]
*  So, but no, I prefer comedy first. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3955.0s)]
*  But I do like creating. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3956.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3958.0s)]
*  I do, I have some other things that I'm working on. I like behind the camera. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3959.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3964.0s)]
*  It's a lot of fucking work in front of that camera. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3965.0s)]
*  Especially when it's your show because you got to memorize lines, you got to write jokes, you got to help write it. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3967.0s)]
*  Then, you know, when all the other actors go home, your ass is still up. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3972.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3975.0s)]
*  And you still, this is your show, so you got to still make it great. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3976.0s)]
*  I literally got a lead here and I'm running to do another show and then on the plane, I'm reading all night. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3978.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a lot of work. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3984.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3986.0s)]
*  It's more work than people think. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3987.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot of fucking work. You're going to earn them pennies. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3988.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. Let's get a different one. Do we have one more that came in? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3991.0s)]
*  And then we'll get you on this. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3996.0s)]
*  Yo, this past weekend, what's up? You know, I'm sitting here all horned up. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=3997.0s)]
*  Anyways, Miss Pat, I got a question for you. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4003.0s)]
*  So, you talk about how you used to sell crack cocaine and stuff. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4005.0s)]
*  Everybody knows. Every neighborhood has that one funny crackhead. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4008.0s)]
*  Who is the funniest person that you used to sell crack to? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4012.0s)]
*  Gang, you guys have a good one. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4016.0s)]
*  Gang, baby. I always wanted to smoke crack, man. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4018.0s)]
*  No, you don't. I'm going to say two. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4020.0s)]
*  If I can remember, one of them's name was Rehab. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4023.0s)]
*  It was this dude. He said, my street name was Rabbit. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4027.0s)]
*  Rabbit, give me one more rock. I'm going to the rehab. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4030.0s)]
*  So I named him Rehab because he never made it. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4033.0s)]
*  He ended up fucking shooting some dope and falling out in the street and die. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4035.0s)]
*  He was so fucking funny. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4039.0s)]
*  And Squirrel was the other one. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4041.0s)]
*  He the only motherfucker that bought dope from you but would rap. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4043.0s)]
*  Give me that sack, Pat. Give me that sack, rap. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4047.0s)]
*  He would have a whole rap. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4050.0s)]
*  Every time he came and bought dope, he was saying you a whole song that was fucking hilarious. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4051.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was some funny ass crack. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4056.0s)]
*  It was some talented ass crackheads out there, too. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4058.0s)]
*  Yeah, crack will bring the talent right out of you. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4060.0s)]
*  It brings it right to the surface because you need it. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4063.0s)]
*  So you'll give whatever you got. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4065.0s)]
*  Whatever your talent is, I feel like you'll display it. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4066.0s)]
*  Is that true, you think? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4069.0s)]
*  No, I think talent bring the best talent. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4071.0s)]
*  I mean, the best talent crack bring out of you is dick sucking. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4074.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4077.0s)]
*  Because when you run out of money, you got to do something. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4078.0s)]
*  Well, I guess you right then, Theo. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4080.0s)]
*  Damn. Yeah, I guess that's true, huh? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4082.0s)]
*  I would never. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4086.0s)]
*  How far down a crack do you have to beat it? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4087.0s)]
*  Will you get to that? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4089.0s)]
*  Were you doing oral sex out there for another? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4090.0s)]
*  $2. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4093.0s)]
*  Probably at the bottom. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4095.0s)]
*  But how many times do you have to use crack before you start getting to that? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4096.0s)]
*  Like, is there a couple of times you? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4099.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4100.0s)]
*  I never used crack. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4101.0s)]
*  They say crack is very addictive the very first time. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4102.0s)]
*  They say it gives you a feeling that you'll never get again. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4104.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4107.0s)]
*  And you're forever searching for that feeling. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4108.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4110.0s)]
*  That's crazy that they can make that, huh? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4111.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4114.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4116.0s)]
*  It's like they're playing like they're playing God or something. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4117.0s)]
*  Yeah, this shit is wild out there. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4120.0s)]
*  Yeah, I always wanted to smoke it, but I've always been afraid, I guess. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4122.0s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you didn't because I would hate to see you say your mullet. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4125.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4128.0s)]
*  Miss Pat, thank you for coming in. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4132.0s)]
*  Thank you for finally fucking having me. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4133.0s)]
*  I know we've been back and forth, back and forth, and I've been ripping and running, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4135.0s)]
*  but I appreciate you taking out the time and doing it today. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4139.0s)]
*  Well, I feel honored and I'm so excited for your success. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4142.0s)]
*  I'm just really, you know, I'm just happy for you. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4145.0s)]

*  So thank you for coming and spending some time with me. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4152.0s)]
*  And if it don't work out on the white side, Theo, come on over here with these beautiful Cocoa Butter Wrap damn sisters. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4154.0s)]
*  They'll take you. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4161.0s)]
*  Would they give me a chance, you think? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4162.0s)]
*  They're going to change that haircut, but they're going to put some cornrows in this shit. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4163.0s)]

*  What though with that kid? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4187.0s)]
*  I could do, I think, maybe one kid, two kids seem like a lot. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4189.0s)]
*  Two kids. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThVq21htCcQ&t=4193.0s)]
