*  And he's a buddy of mine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=77.0s)]
*  I almost went on his cruise a few. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=80.0s)]
*  I did go on his cruise. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=82.0s)]
*  Shoot. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=83.0s)]
*  I just remembered and forgot. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=84.0s)]
*  I went on his Impractical Jokers cruise a few years ago. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=86.0s)]
*  He has two podcasts, one called Hey Babe with Chris DiStefano and another one called Taste Buds with Joe DeRosa. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=89.0s)]
*  I couldn't be happier to sit down with anyone. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=99.0s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Sal Volcano. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=102.0s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my stories. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=116.0s)]
*  Shine on me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=122.0s)]
*  And I will find a song. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=127.0s)]
*  I will sing it just for you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=131.0s)]
*  And now I've been moving way too fast. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=135.0s)]
*  I'm okay. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=141.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm always, you know, trying to get better, man. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=142.0s)]
*  I've been leaning back into my sobriety programs that's been helping me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=145.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=148.0s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=149.0s)]
*  It's good. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=150.0s)]
*  It's starting to feel good. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=151.0s)]
*  It's just taking a while. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=152.0s)]
*  Where do you do that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=153.0s)]
*  You know, here in LA? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=154.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=157.0s)]
*  Are you back? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=158.0s)]
*  Are you here now? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=159.0s)]
*  Are you still? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm back and forth. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=161.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=162.0s)]
*  So yeah, I got me a house. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=163.0s)]
*  You split it? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would say it's probably split. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=167.0s)]
*  You got to go there like 51, like 183. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=168.0s)]
*  You got to legally be there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=170.0s)]
*  It's almost like having to be in two places. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=171.0s)]
*  It's almost like whenever you see that baseball player and he has his foot on the bag. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=175.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=178.0s)]
*  You like waiting to steal? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=180.0s)]
*  You start to lead and then the IRS kind of checks the bag. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=181.0s)]
*  Dude, that's exactly what it's like. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=186.0s)]
*  So it's definitely like relaxing there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=191.0s)]
*  People are so friendly. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=194.0s)]
*  I get to have like a whole new walk of like socializing and meeting people, feel what [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=195.0s)]
*  it's like to be in a smaller environment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=201.0s)]
*  Your move there was your first move there, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=205.0s)]
*  Like you weren't familiar with it before? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=207.0s)]
*  No, I didn't know. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=209.0s)]
*  It's kind of, I can't even believe I did it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=210.0s)]
*  I mean, I know I wanted to save tax money and then I always wanted to live there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=212.0s)]
*  So. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=218.0s)]
*  It seems like a dope spot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=219.0s)]
*  I love it every time I go. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=220.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=221.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=222.0s)]
*  It's just, you know, it's not LA or New York, so it's just, it's just smaller. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=226.0s)]
*  Are you limited though with being able to work out and do spots and stuff like that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=227.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=233.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=234.0s)]
*  Cause you got Zanies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=235.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=236.0s)]
*  And there's no like produce. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=237.0s)]
*  There's no, there's no like bar or produce shows or anything like that at all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=238.0s)]
*  There may. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=242.0s)]
*  I don't think there's a big scene. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=243.0s)]
*  So it's just Zanies. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=244.0s)]
*  So when you're there for like weeks at a time, are you just going to Zanies every night and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=246.0s)]
*  pop it in or you can't really do that so you can kind of go. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=251.0s)]
*  They have an open Mike night or I'll do my own night. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=254.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=258.0s)]
*  But it's like kind of, yeah, it's a, that's the tough part is keeping the comedy going [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=259.0s)]
*  right during the pandemic. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=263.88s)]
*  It didn't matter because a lot of places weren't open anyway. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=264.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=267.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=268.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=269.44s)]
*  But this keeps you probably sharp, especially the one that you do when you just do it yourself. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=270.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=273.0s)]
*  I think that helps. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=274.0s)]
*  I mean, for me really comedy, I gotta be on stage. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=278.92s)]
*  I gotta be, I'll learn about it as repetition. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=280.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=283.06s)]
*  Like some people, they're more, they write the stuff [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  and if it's a good, but I gotta be up there feeling it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=285.42s)]
*  Yeah, you write stuff down or no, ever? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=287.86s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=290.7s)]
*  If I get my friends to laugh sometimes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=292.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  I'll write out like the big beats, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=295.26s)]
*  but like then if I haven't done, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  what I'll do is if I haven't done, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=300.24s)]
*  during the pandemic I went back and transcribed everything. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=301.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=304.26s)]
*  Because it was just easier to get back into it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  after that long, you know? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=307.64s)]
*  So I was like, I have a reference point anytime I blank [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=308.5s)]
*  because I was getting back up and missing whole chunks. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=311.1s)]
*  Oh, that's the worst. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=313.48s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=314.32s)]
*  Yeah, the worst is like the other night I did a show [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=315.16s)]
*  and I got to the end of the show [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=316.98s)]
*  and I almost wanted to run back out there [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  because I forgot to do one of the best bits. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=319.70000000000005s)]
*  Like, how do we forget? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  Not even a tag, a bit, a full bit? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=323.82s)]
*  A full bit, man. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=325.74s)]
*  Oh, so I want to apologize. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=326.82s)]
*  I think that was in, I think that was in Midland, Texas, man. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  I owe you guys a good joke. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=333.62s)]
*  But yeah, is it hard to separate, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=335.96s)]
*  like do you find a tough time doing stuff for your show [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=338.68s)]
*  and then getting into a different brain for comedy [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=343.56s)]
*  or not really? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=345.76s)]
*  Nah, I haven't compartmentalized, you know? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=346.6s)]
*  But what's kind of gets tricky is like [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=348.64s)]
*  when I'm going to tour with the guys, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=350.92s)]
*  and like I'm doing my tour right now through February. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=353.36s)]
*  So, but I usually don't tour at the same time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=356.4s)]
*  I can, but like really it's for like, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  because I can't sell tickets in the same market [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=362.12s)]
*  for both tours, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=365.86s)]
*  So if one of them goes, like if we're usually, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  they take press, the big one takes precedent. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=368.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  And then when that's kind of through, I'll start mine, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=371.74s)]
*  or at least like six months into it, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=374.22s)]
*  I'll start the dates that were six months before it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=375.62s)]
*  So it's like a rolling thing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=378.26000000000005s)]
*  But since the pandemic, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  we didn't have our fifth tour written yet and I had mine. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  So, and I had to cancel my tour from before the pandemic. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  So, so now I've been on tour the whole year [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=385.94s)]
*  and we don't start with them until February. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=388.18s)]
*  So we're going to start writing that now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  That's stressful too, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=392.4s)]
*  because we don't do right comedy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=393.56s)]
*  the way that we would individually. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=397.12s)]
*  So we got to do this like whole different process, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=398.84s)]
*  but they'll put up the sales, the tickets [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=401.98s)]
*  before we even have a joke written. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=404.28s)]
*  So I get like massive anxiety. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=406.04s)]
*  Pressure. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=408.48s)]
*  This is like the fifth tour, like over 10 years [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=409.32s)]
*  that that's happened. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=411.36s)]
*  Every two years when we're in this phase, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=412.32s)]
*  I get like chest pains, like all the stress manifests itself. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=414.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=420.96s)]
*  I get like shooting pains in like my head and shit. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=422.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh dude, I've had that shit. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  I go get EKGs, this, that, and like stress. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=424.74s)]
*  And it's always this time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=427.26s)]
*  Cause it's so nerve wracking to have people [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=429.24s)]
*  buying tickets to a show that you haven't written [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=431.06s)]
*  a joke to yet. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=433.3s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=434.42s)]
*  It's like, I get like nauseous. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=435.3s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=437.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's, I think it's nice [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=438.7s)]
*  cause it says something about that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=440.02s)]
*  You want to show up with something legitimate for people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=440.86s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you want to actually show, you know, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=443.62s)]
*  some people wouldn't care that it's like, yeah, sell them, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=445.82s)]
*  whatever, I'll get out there. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=447.74s)]
*  Yeah, but you gotta. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=448.86s)]
*  I'll juggle. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=449.98s)]
*  I know. I know. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  But I mean, you know, it's different too with other people. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=452.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=456.36s)]
*  Yeah. I'm sure that it's a totally different energy [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=457.4s)]

*  You said you just started taking one. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=463.04s)]
*  Yeah. I started like, I guess it's gotta be [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=465.12s)]

*  Well buterin, I was doing, I started doing kind of some [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=492.64s)]
*  weird, like a little bit of like, not weird stuff, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=495.46s)]
*  but I like couldn't, I wasn't doing good. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  I started spinning out. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=502.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=503.18s)]
*  But you feel good on it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=504.02s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I was spinning out before. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=505.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=507.82s)]
*  Yeah. So I talked to a couple of people, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=508.8s)]
*  a couple of people I know were on it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  So I was trying to tackle two things with my doctor. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  One was the anxiety and depression. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=515.22s)]
*  And the other one was my ADHD and OCD. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=517.1s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=519.74s)]
*  So he's like, both of those ones could affect the other [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=520.62s)]
*  in some ways. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=523.62s)]
*  And we got to treat one at a time. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=524.86s)]
*  So, cause we got to figure out what you react well to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=526.46s)]
*  and not. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=530.0600000000001s)]
*  So he's like, which one do you want to tackle first? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=530.9s)]
*  So I'm like, I've been living with ADHD and OCD forever. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=532.82s)]
*  So like, I didn't even know, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=536.7s)]
*  I didn't even know I had it until people started telling me, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=539.6400000000001s)]
*  oh no. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=542.44s)]
*  And then I realized like, oh, you don't have to live this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  way. Like I didn't even know that before. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  I just thought it was like normal to not remember anything, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=547.36s)]
*  to have shit race into my mind at all times. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=550.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  Like all that stuff, I just, that's the way I always can't [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=554.9000000000001s)]
*  focus on anything, but I just like, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=556.5200000000001s)]
*  it's the way I've always done it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=558.22s)]
*  So I just, just do it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=559.4200000000001s)]
*  I just function with it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=561.0s)]
*  Right. You thought this is who I am. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  And then I had a really good friend tell me like, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=563.4000000000001s)]
*  he had all that stuff and he gave me a book and I didn't [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=565.62s)]
*  read the book, but he was like, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, you don't have to live this way at all. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  So I went and I got a, I went and for years ago I went and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=573.1s)]
*  when he gave me that book and I said, forget, I'll go. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=577.2600000000001s)]
*  I took a test, you know, and I would, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=579.22s)]
*  they put like straps on my wrist, ankles and head. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=581.6600000000001s)]
*  Really? And head? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=584.74s)]
*  Yeah. Like, like, like, like, like, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=585.96s)]
*  that straps like hold me down, but like bands, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=587.5400000000001s)]
*  Do you ever take, you ever, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=591.3800000000001s)]
*  you ever did anything like that? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=592.22s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think I've had it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=594.36s)]
*  I could have it though. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=595.8s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. So I went, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=597.12s)]
*  So I go in this little room, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=599.4s)]
*  they sit in front of a computer and they, and they say, all right, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=600.52s)]
*  take the mouse and they're like, you're just going to have for like 20, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=603.4s)]

*  I was like wired all day and then my lady went to sleep and I was like, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=748.58s)]
*  I'll be asleep in a little while. It was like the stereotypical thing. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=751.94s)]
*  I stayed up all night, cleaned the house with scrub and shit. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=754.1800000000001s)]
*  It was really stereotypical. Like, yeah. And then I, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=756.74s)]
*  and then I started like my heart was beating on my chest. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=758.9000000000001s)]
*  I was pouring sweat. I looked like I just, I was jogging. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=761.14s)]
*  I was just in the house and I woke her up. I'm like, this doesn't feel good, man. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=764.92s)]
*  And she's like, this is insane. You know, whatever. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=768.92s)]
*  But then she had to go back to bed. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=770.64s)]
*  But then I was like, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  no, she's like, you want to go to the hospital? I was like, no. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=781.08s)]

*  there's nothing I can do. I was like, I'm just going to keep cleaning. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=785.0s)]
*  I want to do a puzzle. I want to open a business. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. And then I was like, all right, I'll go back to bed. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=791.68s)]
*  Wake me up in an hour, bro. My friends, sometimes I'd be so coked out and I'd [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=795.36s)]
*  have him around. I'd be like, bro, you got to come spend some time with me. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=799.64s)]
*  He'd come over and he'd be like, uh, you probably going to be fine. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=802.56s)]
*  Dude, wake me up in an hour. That's what he was telling me. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=805.24s)]
*  Was it comforting just to know he was there? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=810.88s)]
*  Just talking about his body. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=814.08s)]
*  I started tripping in circles because I'd be like, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=815.76s)]
*  I finally started to fall asleep. I'd be like, fuck, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=818.04s)]
*  I got to wake this dude up in an hour. Now you have a chore. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=820.04s)]
*  Now I got to stay up. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=824.5s)]
*  He came there and gave you a responsibility. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=825.62s)]
*  Now I got to stay up to wake this fucking creep up. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=828.02s)]
*  Yeah, man. But then I thought I was going to fall asleep that night. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=832.98s)]
*  Didn't. And I'm like, all right, someday the next day I'm going to crash. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=835.98s)]
*  I didn't. I stayed up through two nights. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=839.74s)]
*  You're like Sully Sullenberg or whatever that guy's name is. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=842.3s)]
*  The guy who landed the plane. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=846.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=847.54s)]
*  It will not crash. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=849.4s)]
*  It will not crash. That's funny, dude. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=851.52s)]
*  No, I took two days. It was a time release formula apparently. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=855.4s)]
*  And then I never took it again. And then like, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=859.8399999999999s)]
*  like when I was getting on the well beauty, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=861.7199999999999s)]
*  I was talking to my doctor now who, who I trust way more, who is like my childhood. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=863.12s)]
*  I went to high school with him. So trust him. And then he was like, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=867.64s)]
*  whoever gave you that gave you the wrong dose, the wrong kind, the wrong, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  everything. He's like, that could be effective for you, but not in that way. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=874.4s)]
*  So we started, he said, let's start with the anxiety and depression. Cause you [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=877.48s)]
*  know, that, that was really pronounced coming out of the couple of years that [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=881.38s)]
*  we had and all that stuff like that. And I already live with that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=883.78s)]
*  I already just had that. Yeah. From growing up. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, uh, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=886.3000000000001s)]
*  yeah. So, so I started with the well buterin. I didn't feel nothing, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=891.46s)]
*  but he said it'll take a few weeks and now I feel like kind of adjusted to it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=894.54s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's hard to, it's like not a magic pill. They say, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=898.46s)]
*  and it's hard to sometimes discern because it's not like I'm bulletproof now. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=901.54s)]
*  I still like, you know, sometimes can't get out of bed or still like, you know, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=905.7600000000001s)]
*  I wake up and go to bed to my mind racing and worrying all day long about shit. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=910.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. You know, but, um, but it is definitely better. It was. Yeah. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=914.0400000000001s)]
*  It's almost like I can kind of like, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=919.12s)]
*  it's not as frequent and not as severe. Yeah. That makes any sense. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=922.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I feel like it kind of puts like bumpers on there. It's like, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=926.32s)]
*  you're still bowling and the balls are still every ball still going right in the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  thing. But there's bumpers on there. It's like the sound is softer. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=932.64s)]
*  It's doesn't hit as heavy. Exactly. Exactly. Right. Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=936.8199999999999s)]
*  They kind of take away the symbols, you know? Yeah. Um, so yeah, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=939.78s)]
*  but I didn't know it was like, you said it was like, for me, it was crazy. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=943.5s)]
*  I remember I was trying to decide on something to do and I got into some like [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  loop and I couldn't get out. I couldn't make a decision. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=951.24s)]
*  And when I would make a decision, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=953.9399999999999s)]
*  my brain would serve the same issue back to me like I hadn't made a decision. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=955.52s)]
*  And so yeah, just that medicine I had a bad reaction to. So right now, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=959.88s)]
*  I'm just on a low dose Lexapro right now. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=963.5999999999999s)]

*  There was a meeting and someone was like, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1468.98s)]
*  let's throw cocoa butter in there. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1469.98s)]
*  You know, like a nice smooth, fresh smelling inside. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1471.98s)]
*  It's like going to Maui for your butthole. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1474.98s)]
*  It's his enter. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1480.98s)]
*  Let me look at it a little bit more here. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1481.98s)]
*  Suppositories. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1483.98s)]
*  The benefit of these were known long before the 21st century, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1486.94s)]
*  but low quality capsules and liquids have given rise [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1488.94s)]
*  to the demand for his positories. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1491.94s)]
*  Why isn't it called a depository? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1493.94s)]
*  Yeah, depository, huh? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1496.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1497.94s)]
*  Because that's where you really that's where you deposit. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1498.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1500.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1501.94s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1502.94s)]
*  I don't know what a suppository is. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1503.94s)]
*  Here's the here's what here's our fact that we need. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1505.94s)]
*  It's like, I suppose this may work. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1507.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1509.94s)]
*  We've been saying it wrong the whole time. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1512.94s)]
*  It's like, here goes nothing. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1515.9s)]
*  Well, you might die, but I suppose we have one last thing to try. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1520.9s)]
*  It's like that sounds like something that like that sounds like like if you only have like a cheap insurance. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1527.9s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1540.9s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1542.9s)]
*  You got some magic beans. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1544.8600000000001s)]
*  When a liquid or capsule supplement reaches the stomach, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1546.8600000000001s)]
*  stomach acids will largely destroy the nutrients through the digestion process. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1549.8600000000001s)]
*  After the digestion process, less than 10% of the capsule or liquid supplement will be absorbed in the bloodstream. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1555.8600000000001s)]
*  So if you swallow. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1564.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you swallow through the stomach acids. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1565.8600000000001s)]
*  So they thought, dang, we're going to beat the stomach and go straight to the butt. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1567.8600000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1570.8600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1571.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's the big one. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1573.82s)]
*  How long do you keep a suppository in? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1574.82s)]
*  Oh, I thought you just put it in and forget about it like a crock pot. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1576.82s)]
*  I thought you just put it in and it dissipates or melts. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1582.82s)]
*  I think you got to go back and get it. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1585.82s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1587.82s)]
*  Then the mic of views on what's going on here. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1588.82s)]
*  You have to go back. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1590.82s)]
*  You've got to go back and get it. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1592.82s)]
*  You better call your sister. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1595.82s)]
*  She might have a couple loose in there that I didn't know the process. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1597.82s)]
*  I thought it was like you put it in and then it just like when you swallow something you forget about you said it and you forget it. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1601.78s)]
*  If you use one more cooking term. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1608.78s)]
*  Wow, I think you got to go back and get it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1616.78s)]
*  If you pat your sister on the back, does she rattle a little? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1618.78s)]
*  We might. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1621.78s)]
*  We all might have a few in us that we don't just banging around. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1622.78s)]
*  So then I really don't know how that works. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1627.78s)]
*  Oh, you go half inch for infants and one inch for adults. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1630.74s)]
*  Oh, there's a tool they use to do it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1634.74s)]
*  See, once the suppository has completely melted, you can expect a bowel movement within 15 minutes to an hour. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1636.74s)]
*  Oh, so you got to. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1645.74s)]
*  Oh, so maybe you you bowel it out. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1646.74s)]
*  But I don't understand. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1652.74s)]
*  What are you what are you taking back? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1653.74s)]
*  What are you getting back? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1655.74s)]
*  What do you get back the shell? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1656.74s)]
*  Like the bullet? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1659.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1660.7s)]
*  I guess. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1663.7s)]
*  So you're not just putting the actual pill in your ass or whatever it is. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1664.7s)]
*  Like it's not just a pill that will then just like how we take vitamins or whatever. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1668.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1672.7s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1673.7s)]
*  But yeah, that looks like I guess that's the way that it transports it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1674.7s)]
*  It looks like a little bullet. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1676.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1678.7s)]
*  You know, you pop in shells out there. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1679.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1681.7s)]
*  Damn. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1682.7s)]
*  Well, well, did you ever think that you'd be on medication? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1683.7s)]
*  Were you against it or you just never really gotten introduced to it the right way? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1688.66s)]
*  Same. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1692.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1693.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1694.66s)]
*  You just. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1695.66s)]
*  This I just look at prescription. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1696.66s)]
*  It's just like it's just fucked up. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1698.66s)]
*  Like the world we live in is fucked up. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1700.66s)]
*  Our prescription medication commercials like you'll fucking die probably. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1702.66s)]
*  So it's like, all right, just do I really maybe I'll just be depressed a little bit [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1706.66s)]
*  and then maybe not have diarrhea and maybe, you know, die. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1711.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1717.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's always like that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1718.6200000000001s)]
*  Can you can you if you can't stop putting on hats? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1719.6200000000001s)]
*  It's like, what? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1722.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1723.6200000000001s)]
*  It's something for everyone. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1724.6200000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1725.6200000000001s)]
*  And a buddy of mine couldn't stop putting on hats. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1726.6200000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1727.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1728.6200000000001s)]
*  And he was he was driving. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1729.6200000000001s)]
*  He was going nuts with it. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1730.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, so he went and got that. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1731.6200000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, you know, dude, a buddy of mine. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1732.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, you are. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1735.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1736.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, I have a friend who just couldn't stop putting on hats. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1737.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1740.6200000000001s)]
*  No, no, there was a medication for it. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1741.6200000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't be shocked. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1745.58s)]
*  I wouldn't be shocked. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1748.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1749.58s)]
*  You know, and it's a type of attention disorder or something. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1750.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1753.58s)]
*  You know, I didn't know how a tampon works for most of my life. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1754.58s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1757.58s)]
*  Yeah, because I never really saw it in action. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1758.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1760.58s)]
*  Just like the bullet, you know, which is great. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1761.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1762.58s)]
*  And what? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1763.58s)]
*  That you hadn't seen in an act. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1764.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1765.58s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1766.58s)]
*  There's no need. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1767.58s)]
*  You know, there's no need. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1768.58s)]
*  But I remember one of my friends blew my mind because I just thought you put the whole thing [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1769.58s)]
*  in there and then, you know, that's that. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1772.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1775.62s)]
*  But no, that is also just the receptacle, that bullet. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1776.62s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1778.62s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1779.62s)]
*  Like, do you know how that works? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1780.62s)]
*  I never really thought about it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1782.62s)]
*  Yeah, I guess there's a retrieval process, huh? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1784.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think that you you put it in and then you dump that plastic thing. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1786.62s)]
*  It's in. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1790.62s)]
*  I thought that used to go in there. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1791.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1792.62s)]
*  That just comes out of the way and it's just like a little like like cotton ball at the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1793.62s)]
*  end of a rope. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1796.62s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1833.62s)]

*  It should come with a little sign they put on their leg. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1837.62s)]
*  It's like, go around, you know, like seats taken. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1839.62s)]
*  It should be like like almost like what do you call those Chinese? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1845.62s)]
*  What do you call those things? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1852.62s)]

*  It's like my friend's daughter used to work at a chicken. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1885.62s)]
*  My friends owned a chicken sandwich place and his daughter used to work there. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1888.62s)]

*  What do we have here? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1962.62s)]

*  I mean, it's apropos. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1966.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1969.62s)]
*  If you put that in the title, though, does that cover you? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1970.62s)]
*  You said like anything can happen with this, you know, don't you're not going to believe this. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1973.62s)]
*  But I know it's going to sound impossible, but the chance you might lose your vision. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1977.62s)]
*  No, I mean, that's I mean, Starbucks, your your buddy's going to be like your buddy's going to own Starbucks. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1982.62s)]

*  I don't know how much it costs to do the. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1991.62s)]
*  To do the what's it called when you give them out, but you make people pay for them, the businesses you give them out or, you know, it's like a franchise franchise. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=1993.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2004.62s)]

*  People sue. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2008.62s)]
*  I mean, look, there's been there's certainly been people that have had things happen and what they wanted in the lawsuit was the actual business. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2009.62s)]
*  The actual. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2016.62s)]

*  I went behind the thing and behind that, like the truck, like was the sign on it, like meet the world's, you know, I don't know how I feel about the whole thing. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2778.62s)]

*  She she might maybe can't get a traditional job. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2789.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2792.62s)]
*  So I guess maybe she found a niche. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2793.62s)]
*  Maybe she has a family in the carnival world. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2794.62s)]

*  I'm thinking about it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2900.62s)]
*  She might have. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2901.62s)]
*  You might like she might just be like she might like they might close the front and then that's just her house because it looked like a house in there. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2902.62s)]
*  Let's pull that up. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2908.62s)]
*  World's smallest woman. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2909.62s)]
*  Can we get some information here, brother? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2910.62s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the yeah, the horse I saw was so small, man, you could I bet it would be kind of nice to be so small because your parts are right there. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2911.62s)]
*  Imagine taking a nap when you're so little. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2921.62s)]
*  It must feel so good. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2924.62s)]
*  I get that. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2925.62s)]

*  OK, so yeah, I mean, there are there's pros and cons to everything. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2942.62s)]
*  Like Kevin Durant, it probably takes him a little over a second to get a snack into his mouth. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2945.62s)]
*  You think? Yeah, he probably he's he doesn't experience the joys of the world's smallest woman. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2949.62s)]
*  No, and to be able to just to open a peanut, you put it in one hand and then punch it with the other. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2954.62s)]
*  I never thought of that. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2961.62s)]
*  Oh, so far. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2963.62s)]
*  It's like punching peanuts, because to her, it's like, yeah, the peanuts like almost like a circus peanut. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2964.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2970.62s)]

*  Now, I guess are we saying shortest or we saying smallest because there's a there's kind of something different there. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2984.62s)]
*  They I think from what I gather, my memory serves, they said smallest. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=2991.62s)]

*  I was thinking, but like, really, you think they get them off dolls? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3045.62s)]
*  We had a small guy at our school and his daddy would get clothing off of some dolls for him once in a while. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3048.62s)]

*  Dude, I remember one time I was in Iraq doing a military show and one lady hit me up on social media [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3293.62s)]
*  and offered to meet me in a Black Hawk helicopter and give me a blowjob, give me a little bit of oral. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3300.62s)]
*  And I didn't do it, man. I got just too nervous out. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3308.62s)]
*  It's a unique scenario for sure. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3313.62s)]
*  Yeah. And I just didn't know what protocol was. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3315.62s)]
*  I don't want to be some dude who looks like an insurgent or whatever. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3318.62s)]
*  Yeah. You know, because I have long hair. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3322.62s)]
*  Yeah. So I just didn't want to. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3324.62s)]
*  This lady was on the clock. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3326.62s)]
*  This lady was a bona fide military woman. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3327.62s)]
*  Really? Oh, yeah. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3331.62s)]
*  Now, did she think the blowjob offer in and of itself wasn't going to be enough? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3332.62s)]
*  Like, why did she sweeten the deal with a Black Hawk helicopter? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3337.62s)]
*  She just said the flight is, the flight thing isn't secure tonight or whatever. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3340.62s)]
*  So we can meet up in a Black Hawk and I'll give you a blowjob. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3345.62s)]
*  But you weren't going to take flight. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3348.62s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. Maybe in here. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3350.62s)]
*  Yeah, maybe in my head, dude. But yeah, no. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3353.62s)]
*  But and and also I remember this is this is the part I feel worse about kind of is this shitty huge, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3355.62s)]
*  either a animal, a bit in her on the neck or a huge acne, a huge one acne. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3361.62s)]
*  OK, and I was just like, I felt like it would almost be a game show. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3367.62s)]
*  What was going to bust first? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3372.62s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3376.62s)]
*  He had a fucking IED under her neck. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3380.62s)]
*  Yeah, now I can see the danger. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3383.62s)]
*  I can see now where the hesitation came in. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3386.62s)]
*  You know, because but if that wasn't there, would you have been Black Hawk down on that? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3389.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's Black Hawk down. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3393.62s)]
*  That's our version. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3395.62s)]
*  She if the goiter, if the goiter wasn't there, you would have had that experience [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3398.62s)]
*  because that's almost hard to turn down. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3403.62s)]
*  Like it would take a goiter or something like that to to to thwart this experience. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3405.62s)]
*  I should not have turned it down. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3410.62s)]
*  What an idiot. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3413.62s)]
*  Because it's a good story that it was offered, but it will be an amazing story. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3414.62s)]
*  I know. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3418.62s)]
*  I think I was just so I didn't know if we would be what if we got caught and then I'm giving a bad look to this group. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3420.62s)]
*  There was just some other implications. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3427.62s)]
*  And dude, some other lady, if you go over there for the military, dude, somebody will they'll do sex with you, bro, men or women, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3429.62s)]

*  Another lady tried to come by and have sex one time. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3442.62s)]
*  They must like the single single people in the military must bang each other like there's nobody's business. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3446.62s)]
*  They must because they know that only me there for a few years. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3455.62s)]
*  You know, I think it gets kind of territorial, though. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3458.62s)]
*  I had a friend of mine, Marius Sailor, that came in for Fleet Week. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3461.62s)]
*  Yeah, I used to work at his neighborhood bar and we were on the water in Staten Island. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3465.62s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3548.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3549.62s)]
*  Remember him? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3550.62s)]
*  Oh, Popeye. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3551.62s)]
*  Hell, yeah. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3552.62s)]
*  Remember live action Popeye, though? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3553.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3555.62s)]
*  Robin Williams played Popeye. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3556.62s)]
*  Did he? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3557.62s)]
*  He did the voice. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3558.62s)]
*  He did. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3559.62s)]
*  He didn't do the voice. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3560.62s)]
*  It was live action. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3561.62s)]
*  Yeah, like a real film. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3562.62s)]
*  I'm talking about the cartoon. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3563.62s)]
*  Can we get that cartoon of Popeye? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3564.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3566.62s)]
*  But you've never seen Robin Williams play Popeye? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3567.62s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3570.62s)]
*  With Shelley Duvall as olive oil? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3571.62s)]
*  Never. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3573.62s)]
*  Never. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3574.62s)]
*  Dude, it is a classic. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3575.62s)]
*  I never knew this existed and I cannot wait to watch it. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3576.62s)]
*  Look at his forearms. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3579.62s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3580.62s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3581.62s)]
*  Yo, this is one of the tapes I played until it broke when I was a little kid. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3582.62s)]
*  Oh, dude, I'm so excited to watch this. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3586.62s)]
*  I didn't know this existed. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3588.62s)]
*  I didn't even know they had this. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3589.62s)]
*  You're going to like this, man. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3590.62s)]
*  He fights a giant squid. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3591.62s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3592.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3593.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3594.62s)]
*  When I was little, Popeye was ... I don't think kids know Popeye today. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3595.62s)]
*  No, I don't think they know about it. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3599.62s)]
*  And Popeye also ... Who did the voice for Popeye the cartoon? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3600.62s)]
*  There you go. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3603.62s)]
*  There he was. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3604.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3605.62s)]
*  And because that was like the original G.I. Joe was Popeye. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3606.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3613.62s)]
*  Like people don't realize that. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3614.62s)]
*  That's who we had. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3615.62s)]
*  I was Popeye out. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3616.62s)]
*  I had Popeye on the video game too. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3617.62s)]
*  I don't think we had that. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3618.62s)]
*  But we had Popeye's chicken in Louisiana. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3620.62s)]
*  So every way ... [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3622.62s)]
*  Is that him? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3623.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3624.62s)]
*  It was. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3625.62s)]
*  Oh, it was? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3626.62s)]
*  Because you used to get the figurine if you went over there. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3627.62s)]
*  They gave you the figurine. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3629.62s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3630.62s)]
*  So that's his fried chicken. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3631.62s)]
*  I don't get the connection. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3632.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3633.62s)]
*  The sailor and the fried chicken, I don't get it. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3634.62s)]
*  I think they had named it Popeye's and then ... [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3637.62s)]
*  Retrofitted it to him? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3641.62s)]
*  They might have. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3643.62s)]
*  So Jack Mercer did the voice there for Popeye the sailor. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3644.62s)]
*  Can you get the YouTube of Jack Mercer doing that voice or will we be able to use it? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3648.62s)]
*  You started to say something when I said Popeye that I was like, oh shit, yeah. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3652.62s)]
*  Or cruise. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3657.62s)]
*  I went on your cruise. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3658.62s)]
*  Oh, right on, right on, right on. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3659.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3660.62s)]
*  They just had a cruise issue. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3661.62s)]
*  What was that thing in the news too? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3662.62s)]
*  I want to hear this Jack Mercer do the voice. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3663.62s)]
*  Can we see him do the voice? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3665.62s)]
*  I ate spinach because of him. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3667.62s)]
*  I didn't like spinach. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3669.62s)]
*  I didn't like veggies. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3671.62s)]
*  And I wouldn't eat it and my dad would be like, Popeye eats it. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3672.62s)]
*  So we got a one and a two and a pair of threes. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3675.62s)]
*  The votes are all in. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3679.62s)]
*  They're not something of the voice would creep through there and it worked out beautifully. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3680.62s)]
*  Number one, Mr. Goldwater. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3689.62s)]
*  I don't think this is it. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3690.62s)]
*  You do? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3691.62s)]
*  Southamboy, New Jersey plant. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3692.62s)]
*  No, he's not. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3695.62s)]
*  Did they just use this as a question you think? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3696.62s)]
*  No, I think he was on that game show. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3698.62s)]
*  That was to tell the truth. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3700.62s)]
*  So four of those people are like lying about who they are, one telling the truth. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3701.62s)]
*  It was an old game show. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3705.62s)]
*  So he was the contestant telling the truth as the voice of Popeye. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3706.62s)]
*  Do we have Jack Mercer does voice of Popeye? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3709.62s)]
*  I just wanted to hear it again. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3714.62s)]
*  I wish I could do that voice. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3716.62s)]
*  Wouldn't you do voices if you could all day? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3718.62s)]
*  Oh, I'll do this. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3721.62s)]
*  Tell me who this is, okay? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3722.62s)]
*  They said it would take a man 600 years to get out of the prison. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3725.62s)]
*  But Annie Dufresne did it in less than 20. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3732.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3735.62s)]
*  That's a little weak today, but no, that's Morgan Freeman. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3737.62s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3742.62s)]
*  Yeah, that was good, actually. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3743.62s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3745.62s)]
*  I closed my eyes for a little bit of it. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3746.62s)]
*  I see where you were going with it. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3747.62s)]
*  If it's something you don't do all the time, I felt there was something in there. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3749.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, thanks. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3752.62s)]
*  I don't do voices, though. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3753.62s)]
*  You don't? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3755.62s)]
*  I don't. I wish I could. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3756.62s)]
*  We had Kyle Dunigan was on. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3757.62s)]
*  He does them really well. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3759.62s)]
*  You ever do voiceovers? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3760.62s)]
*  You ever get in the animated show? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3761.62s)]
*  I got offered two animated shows. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3763.62s)]
*  You have such a good voice. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3764.62s)]
*  Oh, thanks, man. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3765.62s)]
*  You have a strong, distinct voice with good diction. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3766.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3769.62s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3770.62s)]
*  That's easy. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3771.62s)]
*  That's very easy to tell. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3772.62s)]
*  I, Sal, sorry. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3773.62s)]
*  I don't know what I called you. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3776.62s)]
*  I didn't say Saul. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3777.62s)]
*  I said Sal. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3778.62s)]
*  Sal. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3779.62s)]
*  Do people say both sometimes? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3780.62s)]
*  So it's Salvatore. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3782.62s)]
*  It's S-A-L. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3783.62s)]
*  It's Sal. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3784.62s)]
*  The only person that calls me Sal 30% of the time after knowing for 10 years is David Tell. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3785.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3790.62s)]
*  And I don't correct them because it's David Tell. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3791.62s)]
*  So some nights I'm Sal, some nights I'm Saul. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3793.62s)]
*  But have you ever Saul? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3796.62s)]
*  Saul, no. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3798.62s)]
*  Because that's almost Spanish. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3799.62s)]
*  Like with salt, they say like Salima or Salam. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3800.62s)]
*  Do you have that Jack Mercer? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3803.62s)]
*  We couldn't find it. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3804.62s)]
*  Okay, no worries, man. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3805.62s)]
*  Dude, we went on, thank you. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=3807.62s)]

*  Everybody else had to try out. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4486.5s)]

*  automatically you want to play, you could. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4499.900000000001s)]

*  Thank you, brother. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4686.66s)]
*  Hey, Sal. Hey, Theo. Big time fan of both. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4688.26s)]
*  I just wanted to ask about Sal's school life. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4691.66s)]
*  We never really heard much about his child life. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4694.7s)]
*  And I just want to know what was the worst thing you probably did in school? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4696.54s)]
*  Damn school life. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4701.66s)]
*  I wasn't bad in school. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4704.82s)]
*  I was the class clown. Were you? But respectfully. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4705.82s)]
*  Oh, you know, I was like I was a likable. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4708.179999999999s)]
*  I didn't like push. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4711.339999999999s)]
*  It wasn't never disrespectful. Right. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4713.219999999999s)]
*  You know, you can do anything mean the joke. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4714.66s)]
*  I was always there with the joke, always there like to get the laugh, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4716.58s)]
*  no matter what I said, which sounds stereotypical, but that's what it was. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4719.46s)]
*  Like always when we had school functions on stage, I would volunteer. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4723.26s)]
*  I do impressions of the teachers. Oh, yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4727.38s)]
*  Like, you know, all that stuff. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4729.74s)]
*  I used to love the Jeffersons. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4731.58s)]
*  Well, the Jeffersons is my favorite show. Oh, yeah. Of all time. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4733.06s)]
*  And so it was syndicated when I was little. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4736.3s)]
*  I used to watch it with my grandparents. I used to live with them. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4737.78s)]
*  So I love it. It just has a place in my heart. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4739.74s)]
*  So I would memorize the Jeffersons like I would get like a pad [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4742.14s)]
*  and feverishly write down like the things they said, the things they said. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4747.46s)]
*  And then I would then I would memorize that and I would [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4750.9400000000005s)]
*  have an impression of the George Jefferson and word got out in the school. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4754.26s)]
*  So people would usually ask me like third grade. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4757.660000000001s)]
*  They were like, teacher, like, all right, if everyone's good at the end, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4759.38s)]
*  Sal will get up and do the George Jefferson scenes. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4762.46s)]
*  So it's like that. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4765.18s)]
*  But I was never disrespectful. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4766.38s)]
*  One time I got in trouble in high school. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4767.42s)]
*  We were sitting on the steps and this teacher, she was a she was a nutcase dude. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4770.26s)]
*  She was a Spanish teacher. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4773.820000000001s)]
*  Her name was Miss DeGiulio. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4774.78s)]
*  If she's out there and she's watching and we know that she is, I'm sorry, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4776.3s)]
*  but it's all going to come out now. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4779.7s)]
*  We people know Mr. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4781.42s)]
*  Giulio and you should. Yeah. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4782.86s)]
*  And she was like, I think she was a bipolar. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4784.82s)]
*  Yeah. I didn't know then. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4787.86s)]
*  They didn't have it then. But I understand now. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4790.219999999999s)]
*  Right. Without a doubt, she was. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4792.0599999999995s)]
*  Wow. She'd be nice. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4793.74s)]
*  And then she she would flip out on you. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4794.9s)]
*  And but we didn't know what it was. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4798.179999999999s)]
*  So we just thought like, fuck this lady. Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4800.0199999999995s)]
*  Totally. But then you want to you wanted to be nice because when she actually [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4803.26s)]
*  turned, it was like you kind of got nervous because she she had this look. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4806.780000000001s)]
*  So one time she's coming down the steps and was in between between classes. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4811.58s)]
*  And we would just mind their own business. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4815.34s)]
*  I was sitting on the steps and she turned to one row of steps. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4816.820000000001s)]
*  She was on a land to come down the other. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4819.38s)]
*  And she just freaked that she went, oh, get up and get out of my way. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4820.900000000001s)]
*  I'm coming down the stairs. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4824.02s)]
*  And it rubbed me the wrong way. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4825.820000000001s)]
*  I was like 15. I just turned around and I said, OK, we're not really doing [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4827.9800000000005s)]
*  anything bad here. So why don't you ask us nicely first? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4831.42s)]
*  Yeah. And she was like, what did you say? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4833.86s)]
*  And I said, ask us nicely. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4835.9s)]
*  And then she gave me detention and she wrote it on the in quotes, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4837.78s)]
*  told him to move out of the way on the steps. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4842.46s)]
*  He responded, quote unquote, ask me nicely, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4844.06s)]
*  which honestly, is that really the tension worthy? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4847.42s)]
*  It's insane. You know what I mean? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4849.5s)]
*  Like you screamed at me to get off the steps so rudely. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4850.54s)]
*  And all I was asking for was common decency. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4853.5s)]
*  And then she put me in the slammer. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4855.82s)]
*  Dude, you know, we had this lady, beautiful lady, an RIP. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=4857.34s)]

*  on the Hanes T-shirt. And I put that on. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5384.34s)]
*  Except for fun, I spelt it wrong. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5386.86s)]
*  I wrote Magnificent Savant, S.E.V.A.N. and Magnificent. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5389.34s)]
*  So Magnificent Savant. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5393.78s)]

*  I'm like, yeah. So I just want to support and help you guys anyway. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5407.46s)]
*  I can't. I know you need the help. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5409.82s)]

*  And it would be a nice joke. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5413.339999999999s)]
*  So I put on the shirt. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5414.58s)]

*  And we go to sit down. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5425.42s)]
*  And right before we sit down, the audience stops clapping. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5426.54s)]
*  I go, I just want to let everybody here know just off the top. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5429.5s)]
*  I'm not going four ways on the trip with the woman. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5432.18s)]
*  Right. I thought it would get a laugh, but they took me seriously. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5435.06s)]
*  It just bombed. And then Kelly goes, no, no, it's OK. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5438.700000000001s)]

*  And I was like, well, that was a joke. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5443.46s)]
*  You know, then I sat down to the interview and nobody mentioned the shirt, dude. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5445.820000000001s)]
*  Nobody mentioned the shirt. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5450.02s)]
*  So I and then after that, I just started getting autistic messages [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5451.62s)]
*  because I just went out like I went on. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5456.18s)]

*  I'm not paying for the for the trip. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5460.5s)]
*  And then I sat down and my shirt was handmade and misspelled. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5462.78s)]
*  And nobody mentioned. Then after that, I was like, yo, like they just [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5466.1s)]
*  sending me links on autism. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5468.66s)]

*  I'm trying to think if I had like a real good thing like that [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5487.5s)]
*  where I went on to a talk show. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5490.26s)]

*  Do you do when you do them? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5494.58s)]
*  Because I always feel like they do local news a lot. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5495.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. No, I'm good. I just I'm good. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5498.34s)]

*  Yeah. But I never did. I'm trying to think if I did. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5506.66s)]
*  I never did like any panels like a lot of comedians. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5508.7s)]
*  Like once a lot of guys quit going like the tonight show and stuff like that, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5512.5s)]
*  you really do that much of that type of thing. Yeah. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5515.820000000001s)]

*  And every time I go on, I just feel like it just feels so canned. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5522.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because they ask you to they pre interview. Right. But. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5526.860000000001s)]

*  Oh, you guys have. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5544.9800000000005s)]
*  So with your show with Impractical Jokers, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5546.7s)]
*  you don't need to talk anything about it. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5549.0599999999995s)]
*  You guys have Joe is not going to be on the show anymore. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5550.74s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. For now, I guess. Right. Yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5555.0599999999995s)]
*  Would did they ever did they try and think about bringing somebody else in? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5559.099999999999s)]
*  Well, they asked us what we wanted to do. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5562.54s)]
*  And we just thought about like a hundred different permutations for it [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5564.379999999999s)]
*  and just landed on the fact that we didn't want to replace him. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5567.74s)]
*  Yeah, because that person would be already shot. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5570.419999999999s)]
*  You know, like you get tired of replacing. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5573.94s)]
*  So we just were like, let's just right now we're bringing in a guest each episode [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5575.5s)]
*  to just help out with like the punishment. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5579.62s)]
*  But it's like people that we know that we're really psyched and interested to get on. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5581.66s)]
*  So we've had like Eric Andre, Method Man, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5586.46s)]
*  Jillian Bell, Rob Riggle, David Cross, like all these like really cool guests, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5589.26s)]
*  you know, and like we're booking, you know, just and this we just [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5594.54s)]
*  we finished season nine, the last nine episodes that we started before the pandemic. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5598.9s)]
*  So those start Aaron in. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5602.3s)]
*  I don't know when this comes out, but those start airing June 16th. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5604.02s)]
*  OK. And then in two weeks, we've been writing season 10. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5607.5s)]
*  And in two weeks, we start filming season 10. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5610.3s)]
*  And we'll do for the first time, I we shorten the episodes. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5612.5s)]
*  And we're going to do 18 because I want to kind of have six months on, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5615.700000000001s)]
*  six months off to do comedy and stuff. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5618.42s)]
*  So we do an 18 episodes. We've got 18 guests. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5619.780000000001s)]
*  But then check this out. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5621.860000000001s)]
*  They're just in the in the in the punishment. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5624.5s)]
*  We do a cold open with them and a couple of interstitials. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5627.5s)]
*  So they like threaded through the episode. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5629.42s)]
*  So they like anchored as the guest. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5631.3s)]
*  But in the middle bits, when we need four, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5632.5s)]
*  we made it so that we can bring anybody we want at all. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5635.3s)]
*  Any now. So the idea at first was like, oh, we could bring anyone [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5637.9s)]
*  like from a comedian friend to our family to literally like the thing was. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5641.5s)]
*  We said the halal guy outside our office. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5646.3s)]
*  And we started doing that. Like I brought my barber on. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5648.7s)]
*  You know, we brought like it just because it's like just a mixed bag. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5651.22s)]
*  You know? Yeah. So yeah. So we did that. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5653.78s)]
*  And it's been fun. You know, it's just a different energy and stuff, you know? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5655.66s)]
*  Yeah. So it's been good. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5658.5s)]
*  So we start filming that in a couple of weeks. Wow. Yeah. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5659.82s)]
*  Is it hard to stay motivated with it as things get keep going that much? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5662.42s)]
*  Is it hard to like not that you don't care about it, but is it? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5665.82s)]
*  What have you learned about that? Has that been interesting? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5669.5s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, the motivation is there, you know, because it's [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5672.34s)]
*  it's our reputation and the show's been on so long. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5676.02s)]
*  And, you know, I'm never going to I don't like a half ass. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5679.3s)]
*  That, you know, yeah. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5681.34s)]
*  But we said we would do the show until we like stopped having fun. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5682.5s)]
*  But it's just so much fun. Yeah. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5686.18s)]
*  You know, and you know, our crew is another 40, 50 people [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5688.3s)]
*  that you don't see. Well, we put them on a lot now. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5691.5s)]
*  We put our crew on. But like so it's not just us, us having fun. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5693.46s)]
*  Like there are we've been with these people, some of them for 10 years. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5697.38s)]
*  So it's like this family, you know, so we still have fun, man. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5700.82s)]
*  And we, you know, the pandemic made us have to rethink how we did everything. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5703.18s)]
*  So we did a whole season in a pandemic when we couldn't even go up to anybody. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5707.62s)]
*  So that was fun because we had to we're always trying to push [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5711.54s)]
*  and change and evolve it and stuff like that. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5713.94s)]
*  So, you know, so it's always a little different each season. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5715.78s)]
*  Like we don't just go back and do the same bits we did. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5718.54s)]
*  Like when people describe the show, they go, oh, these, you know, these friends, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5720.78s)]
*  they put in the earpiece and have to do and say what they're told. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5723.9s)]
*  And if not, you get punished. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5726.06s)]
*  That's the most simple way to explain the show. It is. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5727.3s)]
*  And it is like a third of the show. Yeah. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5729.78s)]
*  And it was a lot of the show when we first started, but in the first season or two. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5732.0199999999995s)]
*  But really, if you watch the show, that is just one element of it. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5734.82s)]
*  There's so much we create so many scenarios and games and situations [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5738.86s)]
*  and like that aren't even beholden to doing and saying what you told. Right. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5742.7s)]
*  Right. It's just like that's the easiest way to that's the elevator pitch. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5746.58s)]
*  Right. Like so. But yeah, we so we we, you know, we have fun. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5750.38s)]
*  Like, like figuring all those things out. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5754.34s)]
*  Are you worried about not having Joe on there? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5757.58s)]
*  You know, I was because he's just it's one of a kind. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5760.22s)]
*  He's one of a kind. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5763.1s)]
*  He's the funniest dude in the world. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5764.26s)]
*  And and then like, but it's like you have a recipe that's working. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5765.58s)]
*  And then you and if you remove a main ingredient. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5769.18s)]
*  So I we didn't know what to expect, you know, but, you know, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5771.22s)]
*  because the nature of the show, whereas like we we we are out there, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5774.26s)]
*  like we're always switching who we're doing it with. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5778.66s)]
*  So nothing felt foreign because I've been out there. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5780.94s)]
*  I'm just me and him. I've been out there. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5783.7s)]
*  You just mean I've been out there alone, just me. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5785.0599999999995s)]
*  So in that respect, it didn't feel like completely foreign. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5787.14s)]
*  And then, you know, and then we were so focused on getting the new formula [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5791.18s)]
*  to work and then getting this energy from these people that came on as guests [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5795.14s)]
*  that like, you know, that kind of like filled like a little bit of like [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5799.38s)]
*  what would be and, you know, it took like it's like when you get on stage, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5802.98s)]
*  you know, we got there, you know, we started to film and we're like, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5805.94s)]
*  all right, let's see how this is going to be like. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5808.34s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be, you know, gloomy. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5809.66s)]
*  Of course, we miss him, you know. Yeah. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5811.62s)]
*  But then, you know, you start laughing and you're like, oh, shit, I'm laughing. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5812.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm laughing. I had fun today. Right. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5816.46s)]
*  And they're like, all right. All right. We're still laughing. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5818.3s)]
*  We're still having fun. You know, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5820.06s)]
*  now that's the barometer. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5822.34s)]
*  And that's always been the barometer, I think, with you guys as group, it seems like. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5823.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, I remember the first time I ever hung out with you guys was at in Nashville [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5827.54s)]
*  at like the Wild West Comedy Fest, which is years ago. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5831.06s)]
*  Yeah, man. And I couldn't. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5833.18s)]
*  2014 is when I met you, I think. Yeah. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5834.58s)]
*  I couldn't believe how much fun it was at the festival. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5836.54s)]
*  Yeah. And just being around you, I like it was ridiculous. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5842.54s)]
*  And then Joe is so crazy. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5846.0199999999995s)]
*  And then afterwards, they're like, he doesn't even drink. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5848.54s)]
*  I'm like, what? Yeah. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5850.62s)]
*  He'll be. He was drinking his own blood. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5853.22s)]
*  He'll be on a bar with shirt off. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5856.62s)]
*  He doesn't drink. He doesn't do drugs. He doesn't do anything. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5858.82s)]
*  It just blew my mind as to how much fun could be had by a group. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5861.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what it's always been for a lot of people. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5866.7s)]
*  Let me text my therapist real quick. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5869.9s)]
*  Yeah, but then I'm going to be late. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5871.62s)]
*  And then what time you got to roll out at? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5873.1s)]
*  Probably I got a 1230, but it's only like 15 away. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5874.7s)]
*  So maybe like seven, eight, ten minutes. Yeah. OK, cool. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5877.94s)]
*  Zoom. Yeah, I got my. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5881.1s)]
*  It's been helpful to zoom with therapy. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5882.82s)]
*  Yeah. I used to have to go into the city to do it. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5885.26s)]
*  You just do it on zoom. Yeah. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5887.14s)]
*  Yeah. I think once I got comfortable enough with the therapist, you know, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5888.78s)]
*  I'm going twice a week right now and going to a lot of meetings. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5891.82s)]
*  So, man, yeah, I'm dude. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5894.74s)]
*  This is like even just being able to sit here and laugh with you. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5896.9s)]
*  And like, it's been so hard over the past few years. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5900.0199999999995s)]
*  I could imagine, bro. I don't know what happened. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5903.3s)]
*  It just something happened and it wasn't. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5905.26s)]
*  You got a good support system around you. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5907.74s)]
*  Now, now it's working better. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5909.7s)]
*  You know, I didn't I think I was trying other things than like [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5911.78s)]
*  maybe my recovery program to make me feel better. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5916.0599999999995s)]
*  And it wasn't how, you know, I just wasn't working out. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5918.26s)]
*  So I'm trying to lean back into that. You look good, bro. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=5921.34s)]

*  Yeah, I think sometimes I got in this negative place [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6002.18s)]
*  where I felt just like really isolated and I was isolating myself. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6005.18s)]
*  So it was like I was creating my own a lot of my own problems. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6008.74s)]
*  And, you know, I just didn't realize it, though, like. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6011.7s)]
*  But it's you know, it's some of that's just life. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6015.98s)]
*  It's like, you know, my life got super busy, you know, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6017.98s)]
*  it's like, you don't know what happens when your life gets busy [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6020.3s)]
*  and when things change for you. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6022.42s)]
*  Like, I remember one time we're at some party [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6023.7s)]
*  and you had tried to not have a manager for a while. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6026.179999999999s)]
*  And you're like, finally, I have to have a man. I have to have help. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6028.42s)]

*  A couple of years. I remember. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6033.38s)]
*  And I was just like, it was a tipping point. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6034.74s)]
*  And I was like, I guess we were holding out, you know, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6036.66s)]
*  because you hear that agents will say, you don't even imagine. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6038.26s)]
*  Managers say you don't need, you know, even today, people like fuck, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6040.74s)]

*  you kind of need someone to fight those battles and navigate that for you. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6057.9800000000005s)]

*  For example, mine was I used to wash my car [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6356.42s)]
*  at the petrol station with the little windscreen wiper. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6360.74s)]
*  Go around the whole car in the grease. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6364.179999999999s)]
*  It's a pretty good idea. Car wash. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6366.78s)]
*  So, yeah, what's the poorest thing you ever done? [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6368.98s)]
*  Hey, babe, I've done a lot of poor things. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6371.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I didn't come from any money. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6374.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But I was growing up. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6377.38s)]
*  I got to think about it. Like, I mean, I did. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6378.74s)]
*  One thing I did, I know this is the poorest thing I've done, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6381.34s)]
*  but one thing when I was older and I started working at a college, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6383.42s)]
*  I was working at Prudential Securities. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6387.02s)]
*  And they had a cafeteria. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6389.66s)]
*  And what I would do is and I someone told me this and I did it, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6391.58s)]
*  but I was I used to do it all the time, but I was sweating every time I did it. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6394.14s)]
*  What I would do is I would go get a large Dixie Cup and cap for a fountain soda. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6398.34s)]
*  OK. But then I would go to the chicken tender station [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6402.9400000000005s)]
*  and I would stuff the Dixie Cup with like six, seven chicken tenders, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6406.9s)]
*  put it on, put the straw in, go and pay like a dollar [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6410.86s)]
*  19 for the cup instead of seven dollars for the tenders. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6413.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That was like when I was like a nine to five. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6416.62s)]
*  Like I was like I had a desk and everything. Yeah. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6419.58s)]
*  And I would go and steal those chicken fingers every other day, man. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6422.78s)]
*  And I was always when I got on the line to pay, like I was always so nervous [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6426.42s)]
*  that they were going to like because it because it really is. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6429.74s)]
*  That's really a really a bad look. Yeah. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6431.86s)]
*  Caught with that, you know, you call. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6434.38s)]

*  Yeah, that's a good. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6443.22s)]
*  I was making no money, you know, like my salary at this high school [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6444.46s)]
*  at a college was twenty eight thousand a year. Wow. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6447.26s)]

*  I will sing it just for you. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6734.3s)]
*  And I've been moving way too fast on a runaway train [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6742.3s)]
*  with a heavy load of my hands. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6746.5s)]
*  And these wheels that I've been riding on, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6751.7s)]
*  they're worn so thin that they're damn near gone. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9I6xGzsBlo&t=6755.7s)]
