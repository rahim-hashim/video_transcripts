*  He was more consistent because I quit. I really didn't care about the business. I came from playing in a rock and roll band [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=266.28s)]
*  Yeah, that whole attitude [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=272.48s)]

*  Like when I was doing the New York Madison Square Garden thing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=279.32s)]
*  He held the southern belt thing down which was actually a little harder because he was going an hour every night [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes they do like what they call broadways where nobody wins [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=287.6s)]
*  You do like two-hour broadways with Harley Race just just those just those two in the ring [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=290.6s)]
*  Yeah, cuz they didn't want to switch belt so and they didn't want to make either wrestler [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=295.6s)]
*  That's okay. You go an hour Broadway. Wow, if I somebody told me to go an hour Broadway, I should just beat me [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=298.76s)]
*  I'm out of here. I'm gonna get room service and a beer. Yeah [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=303.52s)]

*  he was so consistent now if you're talking about who drew the most money or [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  Internationally who saturated all the international markets over the years, you know, I had more time [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm more seat time like a good race car driver [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  I had more seat time and all these foreign markets [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=322.32s)]
*  And Rick Rick spent the majority of his career down south and he didn't have that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=325.28s)]
*  Yeah swing arm to plug in the Mozambique Zambali Malaysia all these places where [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  People will know who Hulk Hogan is, but they might not know who Tom Brady is, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  But you know, he he was the man. I love working with him. Yeah [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he um, he's a scrappy. He just will not be denied really, you know [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=344.0s)]
*  There's something about him and there was something about that whole NWA [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=349.44s)]
*  I don't know if it was a W a NWA at that time when he was really the king of it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, but it came one I think on Sunday night [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  Like it was almost like I had friends that watched wrestling, right? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=361.36s)]
*  They knew you but I knew if they really watched wrestling if they knew about [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  If they knew about NWA, you know, that's when you could tell if they were the next level of fucking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=370.12s)]
*  You know [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=374.88000000000005s)]
*  It was a lot of guys that just couldn't even read and they'd be in the stands yelling just signs misspelled [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=375.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you know be dialed in to be like that whole Crockett Southern Belt promotion. You had to be a rasslin fan [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=380.44000000000005s)]
*  Oh, you'd have rabies. I feel like I was more accessible to the housewives and the kids didn't know what wrestling was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=386.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know, so it was a whole different thing. But then Rick came our way [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=392.88s)]
*  yeah, and I'd been begging him come up there for years he wouldn't leave and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=395.68s)]
*  Then once he came up then we started rocking, you know [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=400.08s)]
*  was it scary whenever he got over to WWE we did you feel a little bit of like holy shit, how's this gonna go because [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=403.76s)]
*  That's that's a lot of ego. You know, it's a there's either at that point [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of ego there can only be so many men on the top of the you know on the mountaintops [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's kind of like, you know, it's hard to explain that I play the dumb fox a lot, you know [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=418.16s)]
*  And for me, I'm always looking who's got the big dollar sign on their chest [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=422.6s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't mean to be an egomaniac but I mean I could actually wrestle anybody at that time [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=426.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm and sell out. I mean we sold out everywhere constantly for years [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't matter if I wrestled flair or come all or Paul Orndorf. Mr. Wonderful or it didn't matter [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=436.36s)]
*  Wrestle fucking hunter Biden dude, I'd come. Yeah [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=442.74s)]
*  But yeah, it was uh [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=446.42s)]
*  It was it wasn't that with me. It was I [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=448.42s)]
*  Wanted him to get over so I would have somebody to work with and chase, you know [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=451.82s)]
*  So that was me is about for me. It was like the old school thing the money in the miles, you know [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=457.06s)]
*  So, you know, I wasn't really um that into being on the road or getting beat on every night [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=462.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but there was so much paper involved bro. I was in yeah [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=468.04s)]
*  Yeah, do you think that you felt more like an athlete? Did you feel I mean because you came from a music background [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=472.22s)]
*  Did you feel more like an athlete? Did you feel more like a like this is just? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  Did you almost make wrestling your music in a way? Does that make any sense kind of you're hitting it? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=482.02000000000004s)]
*  You're hitting it on all these cylinders there. I really wasn't an elite athlete [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  That was great on the football field or you know, great wrestler, you know amateur wrestler or you know [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  I had a baseball background, but I didn't you know played Major League Baseball [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=498.32s)]
*  I had a couple things that happened to me that stopped all that stuff [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=501.38s)]
*  But I wish that myself more as just you said it's like an art form or extension of my music [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=503.85999999999996s)]
*  And once I figured out what the business was about [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  Because you can Google Hulk Hogan in Japan [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=512.66s)]
*  You can see me get down and wrestle like Bret Hart and all the guys because that's how I started [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=514.9s)]
*  You know back in the day here. Mm-hmm [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=519.26s)]

*  Well, I went through the motions because back then if you got your ass beating the bar brother you are out of the wrestling [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=529.5s)]
*  Yeah, you know back in the 70s. It's back in the late 70s a little bit different than the Performance Center now with the WWE [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=534.84s)]
*  Yeah, you know, oh I can only imagine me you had to live the lifestyle then [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=541.4s)]
*  Yeah, and you had to protect the business and if you wanted a job [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=545.96s)]
*  There's a 300 pound guy over there with cauliflower is you had to take the food out of his wife and kids mouth to get in [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=549.5s)]
*  The business. Yeah, it wasn't like you know, there's 40 wrestlers here. They've been training [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=554.94s)]
*  You know the performance center we can pick one when one gets hurt and replace them replace and it wasn't that way, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=559.54s)]
*  it was way different back then but yeah, it was a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=564.58s)]
*  it was a [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=567.38s)]
*  Something that once I figured the business out, you know [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=569.76s)]
*  I kind of like watched a bunch of guys growing up like I watched dusty roads law cuz I was from here [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=572.6s)]
*  Mm-hmm, you know, and then I also watched superstar Billy Graham a lot [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=577.78s)]
*  I kind of like stole a little bit from both of them [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=581.38s)]
*  And then I was digging and rustling and digging and wrestling around here and and then I quit [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=584.26s)]
*  I went to you know [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=589.66s)]
*  Northern Florida through P Cola and Mobile, Alabama Birmingham, Alabama wrestled and wrestled then I quit [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=591.66s)]
*  Then I went up to Memphis for a while and I quit when you're quitting [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=597.7s)]
*  What was it making you quit kind of is it just the money bro? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=600.94s)]
*  I was wrestling like oh 12 13 times a week and they're giving a check for hundred twenty five dollars [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=603.42s)]

*  One of the lead singers in my band got me in the laborers union here [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=615.22s)]
*  Because in between bands we'd go put our go to labor labor hall and they pull your number [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=619.26s)]
*  You may get a job for four days at the mall [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=624.4599999999999s)]

*  Yeah, and so then I learned how to load the ships and I became a stevedore but in between wrestling [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=656.34s)]
*  I was a man 13 14 times a week twice on Wednesday twice on Saturday three times on Sunday. I wrestled for $125 [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=661.52s)]
*  I'm going back to the docks. I was making 400 bucks a day [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=668.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know eating the gimmicks and working 14 15 hours [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=671.34s)]
*  It just didn't pay no, so I quit quit I went back and forth back and forth [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=674.92s)]
*  But um, then I figured the business out right then I went back and one time I slammed somebody I went [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  I went to the crowd on like that in the reaction [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=685.4799999999999s)]
*  Got more response than the body son. Yeah way [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=690.1999999999999s)]

*  Looking the reaction got you know more. Okay. Now I got it. It took me a while to figure it out [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=697.12s)]
*  And then when I get fired from the WWF the first time by then senior when I went to make the Rocky movie [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=702.92s)]
*  I went and spent three years in Minnesota and then I figured it out [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=709.0s)]
*  I read the whole mania thing out the ripping the shirt the hulking up [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  But I wasn't an elite athlete, but I figured the business out and I got real good [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=715.16s)]
*  it [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=720.68s)]
*  Instead of getting somebody in the corner kicking him 20 times like the guys do I'd kick somebody once and leave him lying [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I said don't get up and I walked around struck like a peacock and do my thing and I figured out how [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=727.6s)]
*  to create emotion and drama and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  Get people really pissed off at me. You're really happy with me. So I just kind of figured it out man, but I had enough [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  Of an athletic ability to have balance and you know, basically my placement have a cadence in the ring [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=743.36s)]
*  Which you know a lot of guys can figure out [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=749.5600000000001s)]

*  Mm-hmm, and then I went all around Japan. I spent 20 years in Japan six months out of year in Japan [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=899.96s)]
*  Hey, that's what I'm saying Google some of my matches people know about that as much [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  No, not really and what was that lifestyle? I mean you guys get over there [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=908.58s)]
*  First of all, you're twice as big as anybody there. You're as big as some families don't weigh as much as you there [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=912.36s)]
*  Well, first off I was single. All right, I went over there. I didn't get married till 83 [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=917.4200000000001s)]
*  3 and of 83 December [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=922.42s)]
*  so in 77 I went over there and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=924.5799999999999s)]
*  The guy that broke my leg the first day was got him in that suit. Yeah, right [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=927.66s)]
*  And then they ran me off, you know [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=932.1999999999999s)]
*  Cuz I had real long blonde hair all the way down to my ass coming out of a rock and roll band thing [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=934.14s)]
*  I could be a wrestler duh, and then I went back a few months later [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=938.14s)]
*  When I got home my dad beat my ass worse than that suit it did damn [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=943.42s)]
*  He says don't you ever let anybody hurt you again? So, you know, it's straight me right up [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=946.66s)]
*  So a few months later when my leg was healed I went back and I had that attitude, you know [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=950.98s)]
*  because I was when I was younger I was real strong and you know kind of aggressive and [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=955.74s)]
*  So I said I'm not gonna let these guys hurt me, you know [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=960.8199999999999s)]
*  So I just didn't let him take my arm, right? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=963.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, and so I went back and you know [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=965.9s)]
*  Then they couldn't run me off and they did everything he couldn't get rid of me finally. They just said okay [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=968.26s)]
*  We need to teach this guy ain't going nowhere. Mm-hmm [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  So I spent a couple years in Japan learning the submissions hooks and all the UFC stuff and to protect myself [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=974.9s)]
*  not much, but I learned enough to protect myself and [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=980.9399999999999s)]
*  You know then when I went to Japan, I had this mystique of here on that suitor broke me [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=984.5s)]
*  Mmm, so that carried a lot of weight and then just like we had Elvis here [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=991.02s)]
*  Mm-hmm the Japanese at the time had a real famous Japanese singer like Elvis has hair bleached out and here I come [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=995.78s)]
*  They knew I played music [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1002.66s)]
*  so the first thing I did was I went in the studio and I cut a cut an album with a [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1003.78s)]
*  The most popular Japanese band called pink cloud so I went and cut an album with them [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1007.7s)]
*  Mm-hmm. And so right away I got over so they love you [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1012.7s)]
*  Then the other thing was I brought Freddie Blassie with me [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1016.1s)]
*  I don't know if you know who he is classy Freddie Blassie, right? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1018.86s)]
*  And he used to wrestle a guy named Ricky Dozen in Japan. It was a mafia guy [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1021.08s)]

*  But this guy says embrace it. You're a warrior. I said you're right, baby. You're right. I'm a warrior [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1591.84s)]
*  You know way to look at it. Yeah, so I'm trying to adapt but um, you know, we're going in Monday [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1596.12s)]
*  tomorrow morning for another molligram [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1602.56s)]
*  You know because I'm having some more issues with my back and they're gonna see if the disk is pushing the spine above the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1604.2399999999998s)]
*  Hardware and if it is then they want to go from the middle of my back up to my neck [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1610.08s)]
*  But if the disk isn't pushing on the spinal cord, then they said we don't want to cut on you anymore [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1614.3999999999999s)]
*  And there's because my left hip is like 25 or 26 years old [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1619.3999999999999s)]
*  I think there might be a problem there, but we're gonna find out. Yeah, but it's all from that damn fake wrestling basins [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1623.36s)]
*  Nobody told me it was fake [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1630.24s)]
*  Yeah, did it get more did it get more? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1632.96s)]
*  See like did the theater of it change over the years? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1636.12s)]
*  How did the theater of wrestling evolve over the years? I [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1639.52s)]
*  Hate to say that more when I first got in [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1644.04s)]
*  If you kick somebody leave lace prints on them [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  When you punch somebody, you know, we want to see black and blue marks [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1652.96s)]
*  Yeah, that was the mindset when I was first in and all and I was a medium-sized guy [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1656.6000000000001s)]
*  I was like 310 315. I was like medium-sized [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1662.16s)]
*  Sweet Hanson 360 King Kong monster three 360 all these monsters, you know that I was wrestling [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1666.24s)]
*  It's you know, it's hard [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1673.1999999999998s)]
*  Pushing them around so it got to the point [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1675.32s)]
*  Well, you know these guys would beat the crap out of each other and it was real territorial [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1678.08s)]
*  You know and they'd work four or five days a week [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1682.1599999999999s)]
*  But then once this thing blew up and I cut a deal with Vince jr. After I was fired and I came back [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1685.12s)]
*  Mm-hmm. It was like every single night. There were three towns a night running [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1690.6s)]
*  You know, and so we kind of lightened up with the work and it was always supposed to be light [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1695.6399999999999s)]
*  But it never was because people were really landed in and really people get competitive [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1700.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean would there be guys you had real kind of like, you know [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1704.84s)]
*  Yes, you said a long day in the car with him and you're like tonight when we get out there [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1707.8s)]
*  You're gonna get it got a little crazy [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1711.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1712.7199999999998s)]
*  And you know, I always had a little bit more of a target on my back because I was the guy right, you know [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1713.1599999999999s)]
*  So that's true [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1718.36s)]
*  So if you go and you break Hulk Hogan's arm, guess what your career is made, right? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1719.28s)]
*  And I ran with the pack a lot [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1722.3999999999999s)]
*  But then I'd also fly to South Africa and wrestle the heavyweight champion in South Africa [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1724.36s)]
*  you know I'd fly to you know different places and [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1728.1999999999998s)]
*  Be by myself. Yeah, you know and Vince is going don't you lose that belt monster? I'm like, oh great [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1731.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, yeah, you could get hooked real quick in there, you know, if you're not thinking [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1737.84s)]
*  Yeah, and so there was all that and then when I come back to the States, I do this wrestling, you know [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1741.7199999999998s)]
*  and so it was all cool, but it just about [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1746.24s)]
*  1980 when I went to Minnesota [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1750.36s)]
*  Instead of digging and wrestling so much I started you know playing to the crowd more [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1753.84s)]
*  And then by the time I came back to New York to wrestle the Sheik, they didn't play any entrance music [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1759.1999999999998s)]
*  They didn't sell any merchandise. I pulled in society said bro [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1764.84s)]
*  I'm making a ton of money in the Twin Cities selling t-shirts and headbands and frisbees and all kind of stuff [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1768.6799999999998s)]
*  And he changed his thoughts and and on the way to the ring don't [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1773.6799999999998s)]
*  The place explodes and so I was coming out with no music [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1776.52s)]
*  So I cranked it in the garden that first night with the Iron Sheik [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1779.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't don't don't in the place exploded and Vince like monster. You're right. So [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1783.28s)]
*  No, Jimmy Hart my manager sat down and wrote most of the entrance music for everybody. Really? He was a musician [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1789.6399999999999s)]
*  He was a composer. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he was in a [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1794.48s)]
*  Way before your time actually before my time. Thank God Jimmy's seven years old [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1797.48s)]
*  And they had a hit song called keep on dancing and they recorded at Sun Studios in Memphis where Elvis recorded sweet [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1801.6s)]
*  Yeah, I've been over there. So Jimmy knew everybody and Jimmy [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1807.52s)]
*  Danny use one of those auto harps to record everything, you know [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1811.52s)]
*  And not to record everything but to write everything. I'm yeah. Yeah, right everything. And so yeah once Vince saw the music and [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1815.36s)]
*  You know, I was like, I'm gonna go to the gym and I'm gonna go to the gym and I'm gonna go to the gym [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1822.96s)]
*  Yeah, once Vince saw the music and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1827.64s)]
*  You know got into the merchandising and change the game because you know when I went up there to work for Vince jr [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1830.8000000000002s)]
*  I lived right next door to him up there in Greenwich. And so I was in the office every day [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1837.3200000000002s)]
*  You know for the first three or four years was me and Vince in the office [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1842.3600000000001s)]
*  So you really got dialed into the business side of it? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1845.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah a long time long time ago before I went back there [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1847.68s)]
*  Right the three years in Minnesota were a great education for me because I was with a guy named Vern Ganya [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1851.0200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I was real tight with him and his son owned that area didn't he own that he owned everything and I was single [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1855.52s)]
*  I had nothing to do would just learn [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1861.72s)]
*  you know and plus I just I [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1863.52s)]
*  Just you know, it's too like a ductile water, man. I found a way to you know, really, you know [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1866.48s)]
*  Progress and generate a ton of revenue. It was easy for me, you know, right? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1873.68s)]
*  I had a feel for it, you know, and I could wrestle anybody and I didn't even know if I was gonna wrestle him [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1877.08s)]
*  Tells me who's gonna lose I don't mean I need to talk about anything [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1882.92s)]
*  I never talked about a match really except one time with the Rock and we didn't do anything we talked about [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1885.8400000000001s)]
*  So a lot of times you're out there you just kind of figure it out like you guys each at a certain point [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1890.92s)]
*  Especially if the guy's good enough for season enough, you know, you know, you can make it great [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1894.72s)]
*  I could go out there with Randy Orton not say a word matter of fact when I wrestled in the summer slam [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1898.1200000000001s)]
*  We didn't even talk [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1902.4s)]
*  You know then stole us who we wanted to win or lose and then I'm dead at Randy Orton's old school [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1903.64s)]
*  Yeah, I could do that with Cena [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1907.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, I'd have to talk listen, I mean you have to I have to lead the match [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1910.1599999999999s)]
*  But I could do it with Cena because he's good enough. Yeah [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1914.5s)]
*  Rock all day long stone cold all day long. These guys are really good in the ring, bro [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1917.9199999999998s)]

*  Scared me to death [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1942.7s)]
*  Did a guy like Andre like what kind of like if you guys were cruising in the car like what did he have to sit [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1944.22s)]
*  In the back or did he have to like be under a tarp in the trunk or the truck or something? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1948.5s)]
*  Or how would you even get like? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1952.7800000000002s)]
*  But how would you get something that big somewhere? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1954.7s)]
*  well, we didn't travel together, you know and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1957.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, cuz the car wouldn't go yeah, well we drove for a lot of years, you know [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1961.26s)]
*  Like if I was a wrestler, yeah, I was wrestling in Atlanta tonight and I had to be in Minneapolis tomorrow night [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1965.98s)]
*  I drive right know if you guys drove like if I yeah, how can Andre be in a car? Could he be in a car? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1970.86s)]
*  He they had a van they drove him but then we started flying right [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1977.54s)]
*  early 80s we started flying a lot so it made it easier but [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1982.3s)]
*  If you can imagine there was never a chair he could sit in you couldn't sit in that chair couldn't sit there [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1985.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there was never a chair. There was never a bed. There was never a knife. There was never a fork [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1992.54s)]
*  He was never comfortable [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=1998.3799999999999s)]
*  When he sat on a plane this head would be sideways like this where the overhead is he'd be yeah [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2000.46s)]
*  I like this and every plane probably just goes to the Bahamas [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2005.52s)]
*  You know, but the hardest thing for me was you know [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2009.7s)]
*  The first eight or nine years he didn't like me at all and tortured me why was he jealous [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2013.64s)]
*  Well, I was I was I was hard-headed bro when I was younger [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2019.4s)]
*  I thought I could beat anybody up and I thought I could beat him up [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2022.16s)]
*  Did you keep that energy like when you were in person to kind of? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2025.3200000000002s)]
*  Like I'm not not he just didn't like me. He just really didn't give me the time of day [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2029.16s)]
*  But when we got in the ring, he showed me how much he didn't like me, right? You know, and [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2033.24s)]
*  Then I made the mistake [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2038.0s)]
*  of bringing a flight attendant to [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2040.04s)]
*  The Capitol Center in Washington now, we've all done that and I put her right in the first row [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2042.96s)]
*  And I didn't tell Andre didn't tell anybody and then I kind of kept rolling out of the ring where she was [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2047.64s)]
*  You know and had Andre chased me out there and then when you chase me I turn on a catching real quick [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2052.6s)]
*  And then he heard her scream. Come on Terry. Come on Terry and he [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2056.78s)]
*  He figured out she was met with me and he about killed me. He took me back in the ring [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2061.16s)]
*  You know how you tie the ropes up? Mm-hmm [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2066.7200000000003s)]
*  He tied the bottom rope in the second [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2069.24s)]
*  I put my neck in and put a size 26 foot on it was just [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2071.16s)]
*  Almost broke my neck in the ropes [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2074.6s)]

*  You know the no sleep you have to make a choice between [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2128.84s)]
*  Eating sleeping or working out so the prior priorities were working out first [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2132.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah eating and the sleep was the third priority [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2137.6400000000003s)]
*  So like if we wrestled in Madison Square Garden tonight, you know, and all of a sudden we're supposed to fly to st. Louis [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2141.48s)]

*  Louis, you know, do you go to the hotel first and check in and waste time or do you go to the gym first? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2161.7799999999997s)]
*  So I always go straight to the gym and work out and then [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2167.7999999999997s)]
*  Usually I wouldn't have time to go to the hotel [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2171.06s)]
*  I usually go to the arena and I was always on last so I'd miss room service and food [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2172.7799999999997s)]
*  So that was always a scramble and then I check in the room later at night, you know [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=2178.2599999999998s)]

*  Because I was a younger brother dude, and we were gonna get it brother [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3667.84s)]
*  That's cool, man. That's cool. What's been a tough thing like [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3671.92s)]
*  A lot of you guys travel so much a lot of it's tough on families. What's the tough? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3675.6000000000004s)]
*  What was the toughest part like was it tough on your family with i'm sure with the dad being gone [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3678.48s)]
*  It's got to be really tough [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3683.1200000000003s)]
*  you know looking back was there ways you think that you could manage it better or like [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3684.56s)]
*  Flair said the career just takes so much time. You just can't be home [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3688.7200000000003s)]
*  I had kind of a this just sounds terrible to say but I have to say I had a luxury that a lot of guys didn't have [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3692.8799999999997s)]
*  I kind of like got myself in a position where [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3700.24s)]
*  Like if I took time off for a movie Vince go my god, I can't write your name down. It's hard to book [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3704.08s)]
*  Because you know Vince had a book old school book and he put hogan versus kamala hogan versus andre the giant [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3709.4399999999996s)]
*  And then you know, there's a b and c town [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3716.56s)]
*  There was the a town I was on the b town the warriors on the c town would be like a tag team [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3718.4s)]
*  Uh, like greg valentine and brudison everybody wanted to be on the a town [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3723.2000000000003s)]
*  You know because if you're in the first match in my town you make like two three five thousand dollars [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3727.36s)]
*  You're making money and if you're in the c town, you know the first match you make 250 or 350. Yeah, you know [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3731.52s)]
*  so vince would go oh man, you know, it's [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3736.7200000000003s)]

*  You know, so I I put most of my time in and the luxury that I was afforded was the character was so powerful [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3748.8s)]
*  Honestly, you could put my name down. I said it don't even matter [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3756.64s)]
*  Just put my name down and say hulk mania is coming to washington dc if you want to put an opponent there fine [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3759.04s)]
*  But you don't have to [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3763.36s)]
*  and and the the character was so powerful as far as [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=3764.88s)]

*  Really pushed me more than anything was you know, I didn't want to do the what was me story, but [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4468.66s)]
*  I grew up [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4473.22s)]
*  And I didn't know [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4475.22s)]
*  We were i don't even want to say poor. I don't even want to say that I I grew up not knowing that we didn't have money [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4476.900000000001s)]
*  You know, my mom was a housewife [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4482.1s)]
*  My dad worked construction [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4484.34s)]
*  And I had one bicycle that got stolen. I never got another one [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4486.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I had two little trucks to play with I still had this little pink truck that I had and I had a big yellow [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4489.62s)]
*  Tonka trunk truck [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4494.58s)]
*  And I played with that in the dirt all day because my dad was a construction worker. Oh, you wanted to be like him [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4496.74s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4500.74s)]
*  And so I kind of grew up, you know, and then when I got older I realized, you know once a month on a friday [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4501.54s)]
*  We had one of those little minute stakes [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4506.42s)]
*  You know, and I just kind of grew up and I started realizing, you know looking around that. Okay [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4508.66s)]
*  You know [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4514.26s)]
*  I guess they did the best they could [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4515.3s)]
*  But I don't want to live like this when I grew up. So I had this crazy thing [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4518.82s)]
*  I didn't know was an affirmation. I started telling myself money comes quick and easy to me [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4522.74s)]
*  And I just kept would always say that in my head and I said i'm not gonna die the port tampa death [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4527.38s)]
*  Because in tampa, there's a road called gandy boulevard [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4533.0599999999995s)]
*  And if you're south of gandy or a sog south of gandy, okay [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4536.58s)]
*  And I grew up south of gandy and everybody from south of gandy either becomes a professional athlete [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4540.34s)]
*  Or a drug dealer [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4546.74s)]
*  Or you die or you work construction your whole life, yeah, I didn't want to die the port tampa death, right? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4548.34s)]
*  You know, so you wanted to get nog you wanted to get on the other side, right? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4553.62s)]
*  So I wanted to fight my way out of that town. Yeah [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4556.18s)]
*  I didn't want to be a drug dealer [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4558.74s)]
*  Didn't want to die and didn't want to work construction because I tried construction as a bitch. It wasn't me [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4559.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4564.18s)]
*  I said i'm gonna fight my way out of this town, you know, plus I played music [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4565.62s)]
*  So I would do anything to avoid working a real job. Yeah, okay [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4568.9800000000005s)]
*  So I played music for 10 years and did real well at that but then [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4572.1s)]
*  it got to the point where [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4575.54s)]
*  I was playing the same clubs and just just am I gonna do this forever? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4577.7s)]
*  Right, you know, and so I just switched gears and went after the wrestling thing, you know, and uh [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4582.5s)]
*  It took me a while to adapt to it, you know, yeah, it sounds like that [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4589.46s)]
*  but I was pretty aggressive when I was a kid, you know, and I just uh [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4593.46s)]
*  Kept pushing, you know, I made the big mistake of telling everybody in this town [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4597.38s)]
*  I was gonna be a wrestler with you. Did you really? Yeah, that's what got my leg broke the first day [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4600.26s)]

*  Yeah for what he's done, but because he he understands his business [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4614.66s)]
*  A lot more than most of the guys there's probably two or three guys that I can [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4619.86s)]
*  Pick out that understand that business. He's one of them. Yeah, and he gets it he lived [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4623.7s)]
*  I mean he's always been that I remember him telling us of before he was a wrestler [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4628.26s)]
*  He's like i'm gonna be a wrestler and we thought he was crazy [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4632.02s)]
*  And then he proved us all wrong, dude. I was I was down in ebore city [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4635.38s)]

*  But I had a couple altercations with wrestlers and bars and had met a few of them [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4716.5s)]
*  So I wasn't scared to death from like I was [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4720.58s)]
*  Because back in the 70s, you know, I had cauliflower hairs and teeth knocked down noses [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4723.54s)]
*  I was scared to death for wrestling. Yeah, because back in the day when eddie graham here had the promotion [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4727.94s)]
*  You said wrestling was fake. They'd punch you right in the mouth. Wow. I mean there was no lawsuits [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4733.22s)]
*  No lawyers or nothing like that. Yeah, I love that. I wish I was alive then so I got like I was scared to death [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4737.139999999999s)]
*  Them but then I kind of get used to seeing them come in the bar because we had a really hot local band at the time [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4742.26s)]
*  They would come in to hear us play [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4746.820000000001s)]
*  You know and then I kind of would watch and I wasn't so afraid of them, you know as I used to be [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4748.820000000001s)]
*  But yeah, just all changed man [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4753.46s)]

*  Yeah, and then when I told him I was going to be a wrestler that really upset, you know [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4844.0199999999995s)]
*  and then later on [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4848.42s)]
*  Um, I brought him up to madison actually the night I beat the chic. I brought my mom and dad up [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4849.78s)]
*  To madison square garden to see that [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4854.259999999999s)]
*  and my dad had just retired so I just uh [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4856.42s)]
*  From that point on I just paid for everything [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4860.259999999999s)]

*  Yeah [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4874.98s)]
*  My brother was riding with a club and he'd done a couple years in rayford here [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4875.14s)]
*  And then when he got out he got in trouble here and he moved to houston changed name [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4878.740000000001s)]

*  in california [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4886.1s)]
*  But while he was riding in oakland, um [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4887.780000000001s)]
*  His wife was running a hotel managing a hotel and she was dating this mafia guy [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4891.14s)]
*  And she was on the dance floor after work just dancing with the customer came and shot her in the chest twice killed her [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4896.660000000001s)]
*  So then shortly after that my brother had a little problem with one of the clubs and they killed him [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4902.34s)]
*  and so um [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4908.74s)]
*  Actually, it's not true. He died of an overdose and nobody helped him. That's the real truth. I don't want to say it that way [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4911.22s)]
*  but um [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4918.179999999999s)]
*  So I ended up with three kids, you know kind of like having to support them, right? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4919.54s)]
*  And so I was running so hard [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4923.46s)]
*  I had to let my parents help and then the other side of the family helped but I was the guy, right? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4925.54s)]

*  But then later on I was like 13 or 14 years old. I was playing guitar [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4980.58s)]
*  a buddy of mine who I played football with in junior high school, he had a [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=4984.34s)]

*  You think y'all will ever patch that up? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5831.06s)]
*  Um, it's got a lot to do with the ladies married too. Oh it does. Yeah, nothing really to do with him. Yeah [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5833.22s)]
*  so um [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5840.02s)]
*  Yeah [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5842.740000000001s)]
*  What was the you know, what was uh, yeah [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5844.900000000001s)]
*  This is one thing the last thing I was about what was the steroid use like because I used steroids when I was in high school [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5847.3s)]
*  You know, we would get test 200 or 400. I don't know somebody made us. I think made us some 700 one time [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5852.34s)]
*  um [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5859.38s)]
*  One time we snuck it back from mexico and like shampoo bottles and stuff [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5860.34s)]
*  So we'd have like we'd have like soap like we'd there would be like soap in it a little bit there [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5863.7s)]
*  But we were using it, you know, was it pretty hectic? Was it pretty just a normal thing that people were using? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5868.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's like uh, I think it was 1990 it became illegal [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5873.78s)]
*  You know it was legal before that. Oh, yeah, you go to the doctor. You got a prescription for it [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5878.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow, you know, that was another thing the guys had a problem with they would take so much of it [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5882.34s)]
*  They would ramp their system. I think they stress their system their hearts out [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5887.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know if anybody ever really died from just steroids [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5891.22s)]
*  But if you had the steroids or the solmones and the perks and the alcohol and the coke, okay [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5894.26s)]
*  You're gonna create a fire [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5898.9800000000005s)]
*  Create a fire, you know, yeah [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5900.98s)]
*  So for me, you know up until the 90s [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5903.54s)]
*  I was always street legal [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5907.299999999999s)]
*  I mean if I had a bottle of deca or a bottle of test on me [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5909.78s)]
*  It was a prescription from the doctor and it was legal. Oh, so the doctors used to prescribe it. Oh god [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5912.5s)]
*  Yes, bro. I have my blood checked my levels checked everything. Wow, make sure I didn't right [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5917.0599999999995s)]
*  So you were trying to use it as safely as possible [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5921.7s)]
*  Yeah, because when you turn 30, that's the peak of your biological clock and then from that point on it's down [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5923.78s)]
*  Oh shit, so i'm gonna hold you i'm 43 man, okay, and you're on the way down [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5929.0599999999995s)]
*  Fuck man. So there's a bunch of good hrt doctors around home on the place that doctors are gonna hook you up [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5934.0199999999995s)]
*  I know i've thought about that. I don't want to lose my hair though. That's the scary part [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5938.58s)]
*  You know, you won't lose your hair. You don't think no [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5942.58s)]
*  Maybe i'll start looking into that. Yeah, but anyway back long story short [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5945.62s)]
*  About 1990 and before then everybody I knew because I knew a lot of baseball players [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5950.0199999999995s)]
*  I knew a whole lot of football players. I knew a lot of hockey players [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5955.379999999999s)]
*  All professional guys, they all use steroids [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5959.139999999999s)]
*  There was only one guy I actually knew that didn't use him that was bob backland, you know bob backland [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5962.74s)]
*  Yeah, he was a champion before I came along and okay red-haired i've heard of him. Yeah. So anyway [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5967.54s)]
*  But everybody I knew dabbled in it and they said they didn't they did believe me [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5973.54s)]
*  And so at the end of the day when it became illegal we kept yoking up [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5977.78s)]
*  Because we were out here in biceps like this that wouldn't get fixed and muscle tears everywhere [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5982.339999999999s)]
*  And your thumb gets broken and the philadelphia spectrum at one o'clock you go to brussell madison square garden that night [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5987.94s)]
*  You don't want 10 weeks. It's got to be healed in six weeks. Yeah [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5993.46s)]
*  so we just never really stopped and then [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=5996.66s)]
*  Vince mcmahon was on his you know, major role with his company doing great and the federal government targeted him [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6000.66s)]
*  You know, so we had to clean things up. Well, well, yeah eventually they targeted him and they drug [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6008.0199999999995s)]
*  The poster boy, you know, we're gonna go for vince [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6013.62s)]
*  Was skid hogan and so we had a [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6016.9800000000005s)]
*  Rough goal of it for a few years with the federal government, but then once trial and [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6019.46s)]
*  All the stuff they said he did he didn't do you know, he didn't distribute it. He didn't sell it [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6024.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean you just he did it on your own [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6028.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's what they're not going to get it from my boss [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6031.54s)]
*  Yeah, so that's what they're trying to paint him in the corner. It wasn't true [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6034.58s)]
*  And they tried to get me to testify otherwise. Wow, you know which [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6038.34s)]
*  I said I would and then when I got on the witness stand [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6043.14s)]
*  I told the truth and made a quick exit and didn't go back to new york for five years really [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6045.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6049.54s)]
*  Because that's where the feds were because that's where vince was there [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6050.5s)]
*  They're trying to prosecute him out of brooklyn. Wow [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6053.22s)]
*  So when I went to work for ted turner, I couldn't even wrestle anywhere in new york for five years [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6056.1s)]
*  So they thought you were gonna rat on him. Yeah, and you just said he didn't do it [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6059.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, I became a government witness. Wow [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6064.42s)]
*  Because to avoid prosecutions, you know because they were they were going to get somebody and they were going for vince [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6067.38s)]
*  And then if they weren't going for vince, they pulled me aside and actually told me what was going to happen to me [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V9MFTUEEfM&t=6074.34s)]
