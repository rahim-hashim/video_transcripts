*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=154.24s)]

*  I just felt, I'd had an exhausted week that week. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  We'd had like a couple of interviews. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=159.44s)]
*  I think it was in New York and in Nashville. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=161.36s)]
*  And so it was just like a lot of traveling. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=165.04s)]
*  I was like, I do not want to do this today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=166.4s)]
*  You can really prep for it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  But it was just like burnt out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=170.16s)]
*  But yeah, I think people, some people have said that they think it had an effect on the election [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=176.72s)]
*  I don't really think that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  I think it was like neither here nor there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=178.0s)]
*  He was just sitting there like this for you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=180.0s)]
*  It's like when I go into a bonfire with Jay and Dan, I would just like, oh, you guys have a routine here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  I'll just sit back and get one tagline in. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=190.0s)]
*  I wish we'd have gotten more time to get to, I wish I'd have gotten more time to talk to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=190.16s)]
*  Donald Trump because I thought it would have been just, I knew we only had about like 55 minutes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=192.96s)]
*  So that's a unique amount of time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=198.08s)]
*  I hate when those big guys were like, we have this much time. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=200.56s)]
*  You're like, all right, I'll do that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=202.56s)]
*  Everybody else like, let's just go till we're kind of done. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=203.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=206.24s)]
*  But it was interesting. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  We're going to need to wrap up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=208.8s)]
*  There's some guy in the back, some lady. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  I should have just been like, wave it off. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=213.68s)]
*  But I didn't. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=215.68s)]
*  Should have been like, I don't work for you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=216.8s)]
*  Don't work for me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=218.16s)]
*  I don't work for you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=218.8s)]
*  I'm going to keep them here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=220.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=221.92s)]
*  I wish we'd have got, dude, I had a dream last night actually that I interviewed Tim [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=222.16s)]
*  Walls actually. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=225.76s)]
*  He's the loser guy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=227.2s)]
*  He was the guy that sat, yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  He was on the losing team and he was. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=229.6s)]
*  What'd you interview him about it? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=232.32s)]
*  What did you talk to him in your dream? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=233.6s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=235.12s)]
*  He was so cool in the interview and I was like, dude, no, people don't know if you're so cool or [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=235.68s)]
*  not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  We got to, you have to come, let's talk people, you know, but I think. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  But they're all kind of cool, but they're like, hey, you know what I want to do? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=245.12s)]
*  I want to take power. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=247.84s)]
*  I'm like, Ooh, I like that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=248.64s)]
*  And then when they do it, I was like, fuck you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=250.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of them just probably either want or they want. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=256.32s)]
*  It's so hard to know what they're really like as opposed to what you see until I think you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=256.88s)]
*  get some sort of like a vert, like something of them that seems like somewhat relatable to you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=268.4s)]
*  Another all a product to I saw somebody talking about George Bush Jr. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=268.56s)]
*  How you say nuclear. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=272.0s)]
*  You know, I say nuclear and somebody's like, how do you wait? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=273.6s)]
*  How would he say it? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=275.92s)]
*  Nuclear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=276.8s)]
*  Nuclear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=277.6s)]
*  That's how he would say it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=278.64s)]
*  No, he said nuclear. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=279.68s)]
*  Nuclear. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=280.8s)]

*  Joe went, but then also Tom Segura went, which is huge. And a lot of comedians went like, I think [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=804.02s)]
*  the bigger thing is those five, six year comics that are gone. And in 10 years, it's going to long, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=809.62s)]

*  I don't even know who I would compare him to. He's like the big, he's like Dane cook. Yeah. At the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=848.3399999999999s)]
*  time when Dane was Dane, Shane and Dane, Dane, Dane, buddy cops where they don't do anything. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=853.3s)]

*  And Shane just keeps drinking. And then they never solve a crime. Dane has a big idea. And then Shane [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=865.22s)]
*  just seems gay, raises his eyebrow. All right. Well, seems gay. That's hilarious. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=868.98s)]

*  you know, like I know there's like Legion of skanks has like extra channels that are always [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=917.2199999999999s)]

*  so then that just gets so much of it out there. Yeah. I remember doing one time I was doing, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=925.38s)]
*  when I was doing that Jew special, I would do Q and A's to like, what do you want to know about [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=929.78s)]

*  people started podcasting a lot more last year. Yeah. They just figured out how to get online. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=958.42s)]
*  Yeah. They couldn't figure out the password. They keep changing their phone numbers too much. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=963.38s)]
*  It's linked to an old phone number. That could be true. Yeah. They're like, oh, this is my aunt's [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=966.34s)]

*  Anyway, they finally hired some white Jew out of college to run it for him. And now it's all [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=983.94s)]
*  running great. I am. I am curious about Austin. I'm curious because last time I was there, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=988.5s)]
*  just this energy, there is a lot of excitement. The club will be sold out. I mean, Joe's call [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=993.46s)]
*  will be sold out forever. So you saw on seconds. Yeah. But even you go to some of those other [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=998.26s)]
*  rooms, you go to red bands room next door, you go to, um, there's the black cat or something. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1002.02s)]
*  Black rabbit. Yeah. Black rabbit. My problem is also, I can't, I can't get any on it. I'm a star [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1007.14s)]
*  there. Yeah. So that's not, it's fun. It was like, do you remember the laugh factory open mic? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1012.1s)]
*  Yes. So laugh factory open mic. Signing up for it and sitting outside. You can only do once a month [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1017.5400000000001s)]
*  and that's what kept you in comedy. Cause you're like, I will kill. And the store open mic was [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1022.26s)]
*  like, made you think about quitting. Yeah. But like it was so good. You need that once in a while. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1026.82s)]
*  It's just a victory lap. That's how Austin is for me. No matter where I go, I'm like, yes. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1031.7s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I can't work on anything here. It's probably because you and Rogan and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1035.94s)]
*  Prince were so long. You've just been, you know, so intertwined with a lot of those guys and because [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1040.02s)]
*  you've done so much work yourself. But for new comics, you can get that on us rep there. And [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1044.26s)]
*  that's what's exciting to me. And I think Joe also, he's trying to build a scene, not just a club. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1048.18s)]
*  Yeah. I think he's doing it. I mean, he pushes at the end of every episode. He asks everybody's like, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1053.3s)]
*  so you move in Austin. Oh yeah. He tries so hard. I try to tell them the reasons why they don't make [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1057.78s)]
*  sense to him. I'm like, there's like, it's like an influencer town. He's like, no, you just get a [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1065.54s)]
*  place 45 minutes away with armed guards every mile. It's like, okay, that's not going to be my [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1070.02s)]
*  reality, but yeah. Yeah. He's had people to shoot an on it tablets. They just get airlifted into the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1074.5800000000002s)]
*  club and get airlifted back. It's easy, man. Yeah. But it's such a fun time. It is fun. Oh my God. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1080.26s)]
*  It's a vacation. Every time you go there, you can treat it right. You fill up your own drinks. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1086.1000000000001s)]
*  That's how every club should be. I'm an adult. I get free drinks. Why do I gotta borrow this, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1089.8600000000001s)]

*  Um, you also, you, people don't realize you get to meet whoever Joe had on his show that day is [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1114.1s)]

*  more often because I want to be able to work on comedy more. I do feel like I get a real rep for [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1146.02s)]
*  comedy when I'm here actually. Interesting. If it's not a show that I put on, then you get up. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1150.5s)]
*  Cause I don't feel, I feel like LA, like at least some rep, some like that. I might know you, but [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=1156.58s)]

*  in here what the fuck's an opioid too targeting a pain signaling pathway so unlike opioids which [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4380.5s)]
*  act on receptors in the brain jernavix works by targeting a pain signaling pathway involving [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4387.14s)]
*  sodium channels in the peripheral nervous system a lot of words i didn't know in that yeah blocking [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4393.7s)]
*  pain signals before they reach the brain so it's stopping the signals instead of the receptors in [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4398.58s)]
*  the brain oh this is like the same limewire or napster yeah it's like pretty much the same but [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4404.5s)]
*  it works different yeah that's a good that's a good comparison thanks evidence of non-addictive [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4409.14s)]
*  properties clinical data showed no evidence of withdrawal or drug seeking behaviors in patients [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4414.58s)]
*  that's it right the drug does not activate opioid receptors or induce euphoria oh well they said the [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4419.62s)]
*  thing with oxycodone oxy whatever was that they were like well what about getting off it like we [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=4425.7s)]

*  extravagant same buildings nothing's they even bar go there that's one thing i tell trump like [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5216.5s)]
*  come on in that already they're just poor people now for no reason and so what does that mean they [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5220.5s)]
*  have an embargo so you can't they won't trade with america they won't trade with anyone who trades [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5224.5s)]

*  travel so there's 20 flights a day from miami and houston okay so you can travel to cuba but you can't [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5246.34s)]
*  bring back cigars can't bring back alcohol and we don't do trade with them yeah and so that means [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5251.22s)]
*  they can't grow extra stuff in trade all the sugar cane all the tobacco they can't there's no reason [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5255.62s)]
*  to grow extra because they can't it'll just rot right um so there's just poverty there so it's [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5260.82s)]
*  just poverty but it's also just poverty because the government takes probably like funnels a lot [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5267.46s)]
*  of the money just in themselves yeah sure they're doing okay but that hurricane they evacuated [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhFR2_xJjo&t=5271.9400000000005s)]
