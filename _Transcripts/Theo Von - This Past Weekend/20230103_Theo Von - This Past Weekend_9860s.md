*  I've got a step for you [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  I, what are they called? Lazy Boys? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  The things that... [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  I saw one in Friends at one point. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=142.9s)]
*  He did? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=144.6s)]
*  Lazy Boys are not a really big thing in England. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  Bring your mic in, let's see. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  With a seat, you mean? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=151.0s)]
*  Yeah, like what they call a lazy boy doesn't exist in England. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think because we got it once they got to America, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  people probably got more lazy, I would guess, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  And they're like... [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  Do you think that's what it was? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=162.7s)]
*  It was... [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  I feel like a little bit lazy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=166.7s)]
*  It's a circular situation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  Like I think the first chairs didn't even have a seat on it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  It was just like a straight up piece of wood. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=173.0s)]
*  And then someone lazy sat on it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=174.9s)]
*  And then they had to create some extra... [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, this could be better. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=179.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=180.8s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=182.1s)]
*  It's funny that we got to America and created a lot of like lazy stuff, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=182.8s)]
*  you know, maybe. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=186.1s)]
*  I don't know where the lazy stereotype came from. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it seems like a pretty industrious place. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, especially around the time when they got it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=196.8s)]
*  Well, I think, yeah, because then they hit the Industrial Revolution, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=198.6s)]
*  you know, I think a couple... [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=201.9s)]
*  I don't know when people even got here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=203.1s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of speculation, but you're from, originally from Britain. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=204.7s)]
*  I'm from England, yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=213.0s)]
*  You're from England. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=214.0s)]
*  And so if somebody says England, is that more top shelf than say in Britain? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=214.89999999999998s)]
*  No, no, you know, I'll be careful how I say this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=219.7s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=226.0s)]
*  I mean, everywhere in Britain is, you know, it's just a sort of... [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=227.0s)]
*  It's a collection of places when you say Britain. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=232.4s)]
*  And I'm part of Britain as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=235.0s)]
*  I'm part of the UK. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=237.5s)]
*  I'm also probably a mix of a lot of different things, you know, historically. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  So I think I'm a bit Irish, a bit Welsh. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=244.10000000000002s)]
*  Ooh, the Welsh I hear about sometimes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=248.9s)]
*  Yeah, they travel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  Is Darren, is he Welsh? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=253.10000000000002s)]
*  Darren Till, do you think is he Welsh, that UFC guy? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=254.8s)]
*  Look that up, Zach. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=259.6s)]
*  Can you look up Darren Till as Welsh? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=260.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=263.8s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=264.3s)]
*  I've really lost track of UFC recently. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  I haven't watched it for a couple of years. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  Can he be both? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  He could be both. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=273.90000000000003s)]
*  He could be both somewhere. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=275.0s)]
*  I mean, the Welsh is, I think he's a dominant gene. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=276.6s)]
*  Ooh, oh, he's a Liverpool man. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=279.6s)]
*  Yeah, I got to, I wish I had a better... [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=282.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  I wish I had a better chart about the British. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=285.1s)]
*  I don't have a good, you know, I believe in it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=286.9s)]
*  I've seen a lot of the, you know, I believe I just, I mean, I got to see, I wish I knew more. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=290.7s)]
*  About the British. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, just kind of what it feels like. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=297.7s)]
*  I feel like you have better posture inside of your soul. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  That's what I think it feels like when you talk with the British. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=302.9s)]
*  They have like... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  I think this myth that we're sophisticated is pervasive, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=306.4s)]
*  But I honestly don't know where it comes from. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=313.5s)]
*  And I think, I think it's just the way we sound. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=316.9s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=320.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=321.7s)]
*  I think sometimes phonetics and like someone's accent can make them seem something. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=323.9s)]
*  And then it's just all, can be complete bollocks. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=329.9s)]
*  I mean... [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah, because the British, they sound when they're talking like they're perfectly set silverware on the side of their mouth. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=333.8s)]
*  That's what it feels like to me. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=338.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=339.2s)]
*  When I hear someone British talking like even to that little spoon and you're like, what is that for? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=340.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, when they say it for shrimp, you're like, how you even use this on a shrimp? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=344.0s)]
*  You know, end up being a pervert. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=347.8s)]
*  The little spoon. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=349.0s)]
*  The little spoon is for, I mean, for sugar in tea, I guess. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=351.6s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=357.3s)]
*  I mean, the spoon differences in size of teaspoons here, you know, it catches me out a lot. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=358.1s)]
*  Just when I'm making, if you want to make anything. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=366.4s)]
*  But yeah, I think when I see British people, I guess there is like that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=369.1s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like I do feel a sophistication. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  I feel like I feel like I'm like they came out of the library and they're giving me a free. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=373.8s)]
*  I feel like there's something about it to an American person, you know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=379.1s)]
*  I just again, I don't know where it comes from because I think when I came over here, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  I noticed that a lot of the smartest people I'd met were from over here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, you know, it's just you got smart people everywhere, dumb people everywhere. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  And you also were getting into an age where you were probably going to start meeting more people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=399.0s)]
*  You were in your field. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=403.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=404.2s)]
*  So, yes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=404.8s)]
*  And also, you know, when it comes to musicians, we're not. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=405.5s)]
*  We don't tend to be the most kind of. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=413.1s)]
*  Articulate people for some reason. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=417.8s)]
*  I think we're not the best people to have conversations with. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=420.8s)]
*  I find that with musicians. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=424.9s)]
*  So I had to branch out not because I'm such a great conversationist, but because I just I noticed that a lot of my conversations with musicians tended to be more one dimensional. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=427.7s)]
*  And then outside of that, there wasn't like a broad and I myself didn't have like a broad knowledge of stuff. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=440.2s)]
*  And because I think music sort of funnels you into like a. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's a bit like it's kind of like Pavlovian conditioning, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=451.5s)]
*  If you get if you're rewarded for kind of your. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=454.8s)]
*  Your primary way of speaking, which is through music, probably if you're like a writer or musician, the likelihood is that you're you're better articulating your emotions through music. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=461.1s)]
*  And then outside of that, you can be kind of stumped, which is I think you find like a lot of like very sort of socially anxious musicians and stuff, which I've definitely been myself. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=470.3s)]
*  And then. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=481.5s)]
*  Yeah, and then you then you're rewarded for for that one expression, you know, constantly, right? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=484.5s)]
*  Of course, maybe becomes accessible, hopefully, and then then people pay you for that expression. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=491.2s)]
*  I know I'm paying you to talk. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=496.4s)]
*  Yeah, no one's no one's paying you to express yourself in any other way or be funny or whatever it is. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  Right. So, yeah, you see, you can have so much like, yeah, you start to feel like that's where some of your reward is is at. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=503.2s)]
*  And so that's where your most your value is at. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=509.4s)]
*  And so then, yeah, it makes sense to me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=511.9s)]
*  Yeah. And then I think after that, you just start to all the other muscles atrophy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. So so then chatting is not I mean, when I met my girlfriend, I I wasn't. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  Really finishing sentences. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=530.1s)]
*  Because I don't think anyone's sort of required me to. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=534.0s)]
*  Yeah. They just be like, oh, we know what he means. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=538.6s)]
*  He's probably that was probably very funny wherever that was going. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=542.4s)]
*  It's funny. Well, this is great because this is how you and I met. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=546.8s)]
*  I met your girlfriend. Yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=549.9s)]
*  And she was a comedy fan. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  She loves comedy. Yeah. She loves to laugh and she introduced me to your special. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=554.0s)]
*  Oh, she did. Yeah. And we came to see the first one. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=558.4s)]
*  You guys came to see me. Where do we see you? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=561.9s)]
*  Comedy store store. What's the what's it called? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Comedy store. Comedy store. Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, because I remember one time I saw her at the comedy store and she was like, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=570.5s)]
*  yeah, I'm going to catch a Uber or something. I was like, I'll give you a ride home. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=574.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, she's like, I don't live far. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=577.3s)]
*  And I'm just thinking like, I'm like, beautiful girl. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=578.6s)]
*  I got my hopes up. I got my hopes up, bro. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=581.9s)]
*  My hopes have been, you know, I couldn't even my hopes have been lost. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=585.0s)]
*  I've been like, I'm like, I'm like, literally while she's talking, I'm like, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=588.0s)]
*  hopes, hopes, hopes, hopes. Get over here, man. I'm going to pick you up. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=591.0s)]
*  So I got my hopes up and I drive her. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=593.6s)]
*  You know, I drive her. It's in Hollywood and it's kind of in the hills. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=597.3s)]
*  Not, not, not it's in a nice place. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=601.3s)]
*  There's a couple of roads. Yeah. We've actually moved since then. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=604.4s)]
*  Not far. Yeah. Yeah. Not way out there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=606.6s)]
*  You know? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=609.3s)]
*  But and then she's like, you have to meet my boy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=610.8s)]
*  Well, that's not a good impression, but she's like, you've got to meet my boyfriend. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=614.2s)]
*  Yes. And I was like, oh God, he sounds like a great guy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=618.0s)]
*  And she goes, no, he would absolutely love you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=624.5s)]
*  Or she might have already said that he's a fan of yours or. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=627.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then you guys came to the comedy store. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=630.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was very nervous to meet you at the time. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=632.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I was. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=634.9s)]
*  Well, yeah, because I think, you know, there's this [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=637.0s)]
*  there's this mutual mutual appreciation, I think, between comedians and musicians [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=642.4s)]
*  and a lot of musicians want to be comedians and a lot of comedians want to be musicians. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=647.3s)]
*  And, you know, that's that's like a general rule. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=650.5s)]
*  Although I haven't ever heard you express interest in being a musician. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=653.5999999999999s)]
*  But I'm not nor do I want to be a comedian. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=658.0s)]
*  But I think I think there's I didn't really have any comedian friends at that point. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=660.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we'd been watching a lot of standup comedy [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=666.3s)]
*  and we'd been going to the like comedy store and we've been going to like different shows. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=669.9s)]
*  And I just kind of felt intimidated by the idea that I needed to be funny. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=673.5s)]
*  Oh, you know, I thought like not only did I really respect what you did, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=679.4s)]
*  but I don't get I don't really get starstruck particularly. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=684.4s)]
*  Yeah. Because just through exposure to, you know, the industry and stuff. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=688.0s)]
*  But I also but in this one way, I sort of felt insecure. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=694.0s)]
*  I was like, wait, I think I told you this before. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=697.7s)]
*  I was like, you know, do I have to like do I have to be on? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=700.7s)]
*  Do I have to like be funny and be smart and whatever? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=704.2s)]
*  Because your comedy was smart and it was funny. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=707.9s)]
*  And it was I was like, what's he and I didn't really understand. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  The difference between the stage and the offstage kind of person, really. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=716.5s)]
*  What the it's interesting because, yeah, it's funny when I've talked to you sometimes. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=722.0s)]
*  I'm like, dang, do I need to know a lot about music or can I just share about music? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=725.2s)]
*  How I think and feel about it and that I don't know that much. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=729.9s)]
*  Do I have to pretend like I know all of the names of every one of your songs? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=733.5s)]
*  Like I think that happens a lot of times when you meet somebody of a certain thing, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  right, certain genre like, yes, you do. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=740.8s)]
*  You do. You do. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=745.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=746.6s)]
*  So, you know, I'll be quizzing you on that later. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  If we know when you're ready. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=753.0s)]
*  There's a copy. I do have some I do have some favorites, man. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=753.9s)]
*  It's funny you say that you're not that like, what do you say that words weren't very like I. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=756.8s)]
*  Articulate. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=764.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=765.4s)]
*  Well, I don't I'm not saying I'm not in any way articulate. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=766.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying that as a general rule, right, musicians like I had to find my words really, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=768.8s)]
*  you know, it was a process like it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=774.6999999999999s)]
*  I think you if you'd met me maybe sort of seven or eight years ago, I probably would have. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, I probably wouldn't have sustained a friendship for a start because I think I would have been [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=782.0999999999999s)]
*  intimidated or not been socially kind of comfortable enough to be especially not to do this. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=785.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no way I would have come in here. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=790.2s)]
*  This would have been way too much. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=792.5s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, that's incredible, man. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=794.0s)]
*  That's right. We've talked about a lot of this kind of stuff. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=796.4s)]
*  This is where a lot of our friendship kind of started was talking about that sort of thing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=798.3s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=801.2s)]
*  I was admired how open you are about, you know, mental health and like all this other stuff and [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=802.2s)]
*  and your own kind of shortcomings or your own kind of things you don't know. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=808.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's always been amazing to me. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=813.8s)]
*  And I think that's probably to me is like a huge strength of yours is is is being the voice of people [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=816.0s)]
*  who who are afraid to ask questions because they're worried that they're going to be, you know, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  made fun of or in some way kind of mocked because you know, because there are a lot of things. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=829.3s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to do sometimes. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=837.4s)]
*  Question, especially when you feel like the world is so fast and it knows more than you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=840.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You know, especially these days, if you feel like you're sometimes from a certain area [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=845.2s)]
*  or from a certain financial class, I would be scared. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=849.2s)]
*  I remember when I was young to ask questions in like a nice person's house. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=853.0s)]

*  Sometimes it'll strange like some songs. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1516.5s)]
*  Some of them are more ballads, you know, some I feel like it's like somebody like hitchhiking just through like a bunch of emotions kind of. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1519.5s)]
*  Yeah, they're all they're very they're like highly emotional things. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1530.1s)]
*  Also, yeah, that's why it seems so specific to me what you do. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1533.6999999999998s)]
*  It's like God, this seems like it's not like somebody laid some cement. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1536.6999999999998s)]
*  It's like each thing here is like a somebody put a step here. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1541.6999999999998s)]
*  Right. And this one is a certain depth from the soil and it's a certain softness to it of the stone or whatever it is. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1546.6s)]
*  It seems very intentional. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1554.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1556.1s)]
*  Yeah, actually, I think there's two there's good and bad that can come from being so intentional and being perceived to be so intentional. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1557.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1567.7s)]
*  So sometimes it's not intentional and it just seems like it is because I'm improvising and I was just feeling a certain way and it just came out like that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1568.2s)]
*  And then I just edited it and just like put it in the song. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1579.0s)]
*  Right. And so in moments like that, I think. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1582.6s)]
*  When the perception becomes, okay, you're super intentional and you're and you're always in control. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1589.6s)]
*  Ultimately, it leads to a place where you have to keep up a keep up that image, but but but be people don't question you. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1597.0s)]
*  You know, people will just like assume that you know what you're doing. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1607.5s)]
*  And when you're working with people, they're just like, oh, I'm sure he knows what he's doing. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1613.8000000000002s)]

*  It might just be not a good melody or not a good lyric or whatever. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1623.9s)]
*  Oh, so it can almost corner you in a way. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1627.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1629.4s)]

*  Yeah, people don't tend to and it's brave you to notice that and just say that like, yeah, sometimes my own. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1632.3000000000002s)]
*  Ability or how people perceive some of my ability and then corner me into a place where I'm not getting probably earnest feedback. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1637.3s)]
*  Yeah. On if something is quality enough for the situation or not. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1645.3s)]
*  Yeah. And also people because they're not as advanced at exactly the thing you do. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1649.5s)]
*  They might be as advanced as something else. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1655.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1657.3999999999999s)]
*  But because they're not as advanced as exactly the thing you do and the exact way that you came up. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1657.8999999999999s)]
*  Build, you know, doing that up the mountain. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1664.4s)]
*  You. You're not speaking the same language, you know, they don't they don't feel that they have the knowledge to confront you on the idea that's not good sometimes. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I could see that too, especially. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1681.5s)]
*  Well, that's one thing I was going to say about when I met you, since you're taller and British or sound British anyway. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1683.5s)]
*  I'm thinking, oh man, you seem older than you are and not saying you're not a great age, but you when I first met you, I'm I'm 34. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1691.1s)]
*  Just are you really just 1034? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1701.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, congratulations. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1702.7s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1703.8s)]
*  But I thought that you were a lot. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1704.9s)]
*  It just gives you a wiseness. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1707.1s)]
*  I think to people that maybe you don't even know. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1709.2s)]
*  I think so that probably adds into the same thing where it's like, oh man, this guy's a dang wizard. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1711.8s)]
*  You think there's for an American person anyway, I'd be like, yeah, no, I don't know. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1719.6s)]
*  I think I think people have a you know, do you believe in old souls and young souls and stuff like that? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1724.5s)]
*  I don't know how much I mean, it's obviously not something I approve, but I think these these kind of phrases mean something. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1731.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1742.4s)]
*  I don't know if they always mean exactly what you know, the literal sense of like, you know, someone having been here many times or whatever. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1742.8999999999999s)]
*  But whatever people trying to say when they say that, I do identify with that. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1750.2s)]
*  I've always felt like a little haunted. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1755.8s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1758.8s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't mean that I'm doesn't mean that I'm like in any way a wizard or in any way like because I think actually if anything, I'm inferior. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1759.2s)]
*  I feel kind of insufficient in a lot of ways. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1770.5s)]
*  It's your desk clerk at that point. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1774.7s)]
*  You're running you're running a hotel for souls for souls. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1776.7s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1779.9s)]
*  You know, like you're at a certain point. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1781.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1783.2s)]
*  Sorry to step on you there. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1784.3s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1785.6s)]
*  But I think that's kind of what it's like. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1786.6s)]
*  If it feels like some people, it feels like it's their first time through the galaxy. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1788.4s)]
*  You know, you meet him. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1792.8s)]
*  It's like, oh, this is a baby soul. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1793.5s)]
*  And it's not even judging that heaven if you feel like you are resonate with being an old soul that it makes you better or anything. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1796.0s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1802.1s)]
*  It just makes you you're a damn, you know, you can be more cynical. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1802.8s)]
*  You can be more sort of jaded. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1805.8s)]
*  You can be you can feel kind of too much. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1807.8s)]
*  You can feel too much. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1811.2s)]
*  You can easily overwhelmed. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1812.1s)]
*  You can feel maybe I mean, and these obviously these character traits don't aren't just applied to the old soul, but they can be applied to any couple of different [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1813.9s)]
*  character or personality types. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1823.6s)]
*  And like there's also all sorts of psychological analysis and assessments that you could put on this. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1826.9s)]
*  But I think I feel sometimes I mean, my job extends beyond produce. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1831.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm a producer, but I feel a lot of the time like a therapist and like a therapist, a lot of therapists are very fucked up. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1840.7s)]
*  They're not they're not people who you should necessarily take, you know, all of your life lessons from that or or indeed they might not be practicing exactly what they preach. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1852.1s)]
*  But, you know, they're also people who've who've who've got an overwhelming sense of empathy and probably quite easy overwhelmed themselves. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1866.6999999999998s)]
*  And they've learned to like learn to vocalize what it is that they're feeling so that other people can can vocalize what they're feeling. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1876.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think I realized and obviously I haven't gone to school to be a therapist. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1885.9s)]
*  No, I'm nothing like a therapist in any way. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1889.7s)]
*  I don't know, man. I think that but your music might be right. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1891.9s)]
*  Right. And that's okay. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1895.1s)]
*  And that's that's what's interesting sometimes about having any sort of gift in the world. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1896.3s)]
*  I believe everybody has some gift. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1900.3s)]
*  It could be some people's smile might be their song. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1902.0s)]
*  It's like man, they just smile at you and it is like it can lift you up just as much as hearing like, you know, some Michael McDonald or something. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1905.0s)]
*  Yeah, or some trying to think of something good. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1914.6s)]
*  Love Michael McDonald. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1917.1s)]

*  How did that? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1925.2s)]
*  Oh, just trying to get some diversity to therapy. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1926.5s)]
*  Yeah, I was trying to get that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1929.0s)]
*  I think I was trying to get diversity. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1929.9s)]

*  It's interesting. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1939.0s)]
*  When he came out with country grammar and this is almost a little bit before your time. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1939.7s)]
*  But when he came with. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1942.8s)]
*  I remember it. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1943.5s)]
*  Yeah. God. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1944.3999999999999s)]
*  I remember feeling like I remember thinking this is an amazing song and I still can't dance. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1945.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1949.3s)]
*  I mean, it was we it was just our last hurrah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1952.8s)]
*  I feel like it fell with the legs. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1955.8s)]
*  You know, it was the last Caucasian hurrah. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1957.6s)]
*  Anything. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1959.8999999999999s)]
*  So when things were still moving below the hips. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1960.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1963.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1963.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1964.3s)]
*  So how did you so in terms of like your because I want to know more about. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1966.8s)]
*  The connection between your emotion, your upbringing and comedy and why? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1975.2s)]
*  Why you sort of went into it like what were their moments where? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1982.3999999999999s)]
*  You got a laugh from saying something in it in a certain way and and it helped the situation. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1987.8s)]
*  It helped like your relationship with someone or it stopped the situation from going badly or whatever. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=1995.5s)]
*  It became like almost like a, you know, diplomatic kind of tool or whatever. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2001.8s)]
*  I think, you know, I think I didn't have a lot of feelings as a kid. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2011.2s)]
*  I didn't have a lot of like comfortable feelings. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2017.9s)]
*  Probably. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2020.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, there wasn't a lot of comfort in our home and there was a lot of question marks and not a lot of information. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2021.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2029.3s)]
*  So there wasn't a lot of information. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2029.7s)]
*  There was a lot of attention to learning. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2032.7s)]
*  You know, my mom made sure that we were learning like reading and yeah, reading doing our homework, you know, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2038.7s)]
*  but always reading and my mother was an English major. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2048.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2052.4s)]
*  So she, you know, knew words and she would use big words and she would use words that they would try to kick out of our town. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2053.5s)]
*  You know, I remember they would come with torches when she'd use certain words. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2060.8s)]
*  They'd never seen it, you know, they'd be like, she's a witch. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2063.5s)]
*  She's a whore. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2066.9s)]
*  And my dad would be like, I wish she was, you know, and so it was like, you know, my mom really probably had one of the best vocabularies in our town. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2068.9s)]
*  But I didn't have much affection for my mother and that's OK. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2077.8s)]
*  She didn't have a lot to give. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2080.6000000000004s)]
*  And so I think I probably somewhere in my head thought that, well, if I have were if I'm using words, maybe she'll see me, you know, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2081.9s)]
*  If and when I'm once I started to make people laugh, I'm like, oh man, they you can make somebody. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2090.8s)]
*  I just never knew if I was if I was OK to my mother, I never knew if I was approved of by her. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2097.1000000000004s)]
*  So once she withheld the approval. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2104.5s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know if she knew she was she didn't know she was doing no people sometimes don't. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2106.9s)]
*  Yeah, she just had like this kind of emotional kind of autism where she didn't understand that that was necessary. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2111.2000000000003s)]
*  And so I think once I saw somebody laugh, it was like, oh, right. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2117.7s)]
*  It was like, I'm OK for a minute. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2122.5s)]
*  Got it. You know, and so then I think that just became an addiction that was beyond. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2124.1s)]
*  I didn't have a choice at that point, but you're just compelled to do it. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2130.0s)]
*  It was. Yeah, because you have to, I think, feel OK at certain points as a human. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2133.8s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. And also all of it is a survival thing. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2138.5s)]
*  I mean, it's like anything that you had to do. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2141.7999999999997s)]
*  Even the things that you're ashamed of. Yeah. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2145.1s)]
*  Ultimately have to be chalked up to something that got you by something that kind of helped you survive. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2148.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm grateful that our arts at least aren't like looked down upon very much by society [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2156.8999999999996s)]
*  because a lot of people, they end up into the dark arts or things that are, you know, more taboo. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2161.3999999999996s)]
*  And it's just their survival methods, you know. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2168.6s)]
*  I mean, I look at like strippers and, you know, some sex workers and stuff like that sometimes like, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2171.0s)]
*  oh, they're just trying to, you know, express themselves or something. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2177.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, also, it's just a job, isn't it? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2181.1s)]
*  And I guess the. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2186.3s)]
*  I'm not overly educated on the complexities of sex work, but I'd say. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2189.9s)]
*  I would do a little. I probably. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2199.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Ultimately, it's if it came down to it to feed your family, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2200.8s)]
*  I do what you got to do. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2206.6s)]
*  And I mean, I felt like I was compelled to do music. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2208.0s)]
*  Did you? Well, it sounds like it even from that story of like, you know, you're like, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2213.8s)]
*  I'm going to go in the other room here if my buddy's being a real prick and I'm going to express myself. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2217.4s)]
*  Yeah. So yeah, I think it's just interesting how our expression comes out. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2222.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, maybe it was the I wonder if it's written is kind of written. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2226.2999999999997s)]
*  The writings on the wall from the moment you come in. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2233.1s)]
*  Oh, that is a destiny or is it like it's like I don't really believe in people being naturally talented, particularly. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2236.1s)]
*  I don't really believe in kind of genetic predisposition. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2243.6s)]
*  I mean, maybe predisposition or like some inherited kind of consciousness, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2246.1s)]
*  but I don't really believe in people being like born with a gift and shit like that. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2251.8s)]
*  So do you believe that music like so you are very inclined, especially I don't know all the instruments you play James. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2256.5s)]
*  So I've just got to pat this down because it so easily looks like I've got an erection in this thing. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2263.2000000000003s)]
*  It kind of like, oh, it's up like that very, very easily. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2267.6000000000004s)]
*  Do do it. I mean, I'm having a good time, but I just. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2272.0s)]
*  Sell some tickets for a. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2278.7s)]
*  I could do a revival in there. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2282.6s)]
*  Is piano like your main instrument? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2287.1s)]
*  Is that OK to say or no? Yeah, you play other instruments. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2288.8999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, it is my main instrument. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2293.2s)]
*  Right, because when I see you on stage, you're at the keyboard or the piano. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2294.7s)]
*  Yeah. OK. Yeah. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2297.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Do you feel like. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2300.2s)]
*  That you that art say art is just like an energy and it's going to come out of people. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2303.7s)]
*  It's going to find its way out into the world because it's just the way the whole world is kind of put together that the energy has to come out. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2309.7s)]
*  And so it finds its way through you so you can harness it or adjust to it. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2317.2999999999997s)]
*  But that it's or you can choose to use it or not. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2324.5s)]
*  Maybe if you never even get to the keys and it just kind of hits a cul-de-sac inside of you. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2327.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Is that kind of more what you feel like it's just that's a nice way of putting it. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2332.7s)]
*  I think. I sometimes feel sorry for. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2337.0s)]
*  Musicians and artists and stuff rather than kind of. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2343.1s)]
*  Mythologize them or or kind of. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2348.2999999999997s)]
*  Put them on a pedestal because. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2352.5s)]
*  In order for you to have arrived at that point where you need music as your your expression. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2355.2999999999997s)]
*  Something had to happen. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2360.3s)]
*  You know, and something had to make you boil over so much that there was only one way that was going to be, you know, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2362.4s)]
*  And it just happened to be this. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2371.6000000000004s)]
*  But it's not necessarily the most comfortable life. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2375.9s)]
*  Not to say it's the worst life. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2379.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm super privileged to do what I do and I'm. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2380.4s)]
*  Very lucky, but I'm also one of the lucky ones, you know, there's. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2386.7s)]
*  Millions of musicians who are not rewarded in the same way for for basically expressing a lot of pain and. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2392.7s)]
*  It's not an efficient method of doing it either. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2403.7s)]
*  Like I don't really feel that much better after I make a song. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2408.5s)]
*  If I'm depressed, I'm just depressed. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2413.1s)]
*  If I'm anxious, I'm just anxious. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2414.6s)]
*  If I'm sad, I'm just sad. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2416.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, making a song isn't going to fix that. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2420.0s)]
*  And I had to find other ways eventually. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2422.5s)]
*  But it felt like. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2425.5s)]
*  If we were to use the extend the pressure cooker pressure cooker analogy, it's like. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2428.5s)]
*  Through art. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2434.1s)]
*  I was basically just like laying a little steam out every now and again, but I was never just like turning it off. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2436.0s)]
*  You know, it's like I wanted to turn it off. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2442.7s)]
*  I wanted to stop the endless swell of pain and anxiety and depression and stem the flow. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2446.2s)]
*  And I had to find other ways to do that. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  And once I did that, I was able to look at music a bit more objectively and it didn't have to. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2457.3999999999996s)]
*  It didn't have to prove everything. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2465.2999999999997s)]
*  It didn't have to be everything all at once. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2466.7999999999997s)]
*  It didn't. There was less pressure on the songs. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2469.2999999999997s)]
*  I didn't have to like be the biggest artist. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2471.2s)]
*  I didn't have to like prove myself to the people, the kids at school. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2474.1s)]
*  I didn't have to prove myself to even myself, you know, or less anyway. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2478.5s)]
*  I mean, there's always going to be a bit of all those things. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2483.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But there's less pressure on the art. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2486.1s)]
*  Wow, that's fascinating. Yeah. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2489.1s)]
*  Because when you identify with it so much, which is what happens sometimes as you get successful, it's like this is it. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2490.3999999999996s)]
*  Not this is all you are, but you've become so like in tandem with it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2497.5s)]
*  That everything you do, if you put out one wrong thing, you become so close to your thing. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2503.5s)]
*  Like it's not just fluid anymore. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2510.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2513.5s)]
*  It feels like they're attached on you like sloths kind of and you can't get them off or you're afraid to let them just kind of just leave them on the path of the forest, you know. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2514.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting because some of your music, I feel like I'm like Eeyore, like Eeyore that showed up at a rave kind of, you know, which is kind of perfect for me. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2524.6s)]
*  I can totally see why. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2536.7999999999997s)]
*  Like that is who I am. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2537.9s)]
*  I like it. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2539.7999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for noticing me. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2541.1s)]
*  Thank you for letting me judge you. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2547.2999999999997s)]
*  Because I'm not winning the Poo. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2548.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2550.1s)]
*  And I'm not Christopher Robin. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2551.2s)]
*  No, even though, but that's the that's the rule. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2553.4s)]
*  I think you might be Christopher Robin. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2555.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2557.4s)]
*  Maybe I got to look at some of this. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2558.0s)]
*  You might be winning the Poo actually. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2559.6s)]
*  I think I'm crossed up. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2561.6s)]
*  I think they had a child. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2562.9s)]
*  Yeah, it could have been. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2564.1s)]
*  I mean, who knows they walked off into the sunset and after that we don't really know. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2565.7s)]
*  We're missing a few chapters. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2570.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2571.4s)]
*  A.A. Milne let us down. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2573.3s)]
*  What was it? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2577.4s)]
*  So was there a kind of a moment because you and I have talked about this. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2578.0s)]
*  It's I forget some of the things you and I've talked about because you and I our friendship is just kind of had a hiatus through the pandemic. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2580.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2586.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2586.3s)]
*  And because I stayed in California really where I wasn't allowed out of my house. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2586.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2591.4s)]
*  You moved to Nashville, Tennessee. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2591.7s)]
*  Where people are just sneezing down each other's orifices. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2595.6s)]
*  Just testing the theory. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2601.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2603.1s)]
*  You know, everybody has hep C now, but nobody has COVID. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2603.5s)]
*  Yeah, they got everything else. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2607.6s)]
*  But yeah, was it because I remember there was I think I remember there was a time where you kind of were like you and I talked about different modalities for relieving like whether it be depression or whatever is going on in our lives. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2610.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2623.5s)]
*  Did you have a time where you kind of came to a head with some of that sort of stuff? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2624.1s)]
*  I did during the pandemic. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2626.8s)]
*  Oh, you tried to get me on the EMDR. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2628.1s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2630.3s)]
*  I was evangelizing EMDR and I even went I even went a few times. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2631.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2635.1s)]
*  And I see a woman now with with the. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2635.5s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2637.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2637.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2638.4s)]
*  And I mean, I remember you saying it helped and and but initially the thing was with EMDR is that you you don't really you don't go and then afterwards you like necessarily feel what's happened. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2638.7000000000003s)]
*  It has this very strange slightly sci-fi effect on you where you don't even remember feeling the way you felt when you went in. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2655.2000000000003s)]
*  Tiny bit men in black. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2663.9s)]
*  So a lot of people kind of come out of it and going, you know, oh, yeah, I don't really think anything happened. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2667.1s)]
*  But then they stopped the pattern they've been in. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2673.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2677.7s)]
*  And they don't even realize and they're just like, oh, I didn't you know, I didn't endlessly turn on and off the the hob and like check to see if it was still on or whatever the OCD thing is or like they didn't they don't that pattern just isn't manifesting anymore because the trauma that leads to it has been disconnected. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2678.0s)]
*  From feeling it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2696.9s)]
*  Yeah, it is kind of black mirror, huh? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2699.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a kind of go behind the scenes and adjust a cable or something. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2700.9s)]
*  And then the next time like your Christmas tree lights blink, they don't blink in that weird way that was uncomfortable or something. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2704.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2710.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that is behind the bookcase and yeah interstellar. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2711.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of behind the bookcase. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2715.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2717.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you are there other modalities and stuff that you've tried? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2718.9s)]
*  I did mushrooms. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2723.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, which was very helpful for me actually. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2724.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I go into a really bad depression when I take mushrooms because I think I'm allergic to them or something. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2727.2999999999997s)]
*  And just just kind of I go get really depressed for a couple of days afterwards or not during afterwards. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2733.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2740.8999999999996s)]
*  No, during is amazing. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2741.2999999999997s)]
*  I love I love them, but I've only done them a few times. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2742.5s)]
*  But every time I've done them, something's changed in my life, like majorly changed. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2746.2s)]
*  I've either given up an addiction or I've never example. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2752.2s)]
*  I came off Twitter or stop even stop kind of really using it because I kind of checking it all the time and like being quite engaged in it and invested in in kind of what how I was doing, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2757.5s)]
*  other people's opinions and even other people's opinions of what I was saying and very overwhelming place for an artist, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2775.0s)]
*  someone who's easily overwhelmed, but also I think is an overwhelming place for a lot of people and maybe they're not admitting it. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2784.7s)]
*  But and stressful. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2791.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it feels stressful even hear you say it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2794.5s)]
*  Yeah, and and and it was kind of at a point where a lot of conversations were reaching a kind of fever pitch politically. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2797.2999999999997s)]
*  And I just felt trepidatious about even being involved because I felt like all of my real life conversations were really compassionate and empathetic and loving. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2807.5s)]
*  Even if we didn't agree on something, you know, like ours, like we don't always agree on everything, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2821.2s)]
*  but we we just you know, we approach each conversation with love and respect. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2826.3s)]
*  So, you know, but on Twitter, it was like the opposite of that. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2831.9s)]
*  It felt like if you didn't have the right opinion for the for the group, you know, you were you're sort of out of the group or whatever, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2835.1000000000004s)]
*  whichever group that is right. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2843.4s)]
*  I just felt really over time really, really stressed about that dynamic and took mushrooms one day. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2845.7s)]
*  We were sort of on a road trip and we were sitting by a pool. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2856.5s)]
*  And I think this was the first time I actually ever did them was during the pandemic. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2864.5s)]
*  And I remember saying to my friend, I'm not really sure these are doing anything. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2873.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's all like sneakier. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2878.7s)]
*  Right. And he goes, well, you've been taking photographs of that same flower for the last two hours. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2880.3s)]
*  And I noticed it and I looked down at my phone and there was like 400, I was like scrolling through this 400 photographs of this flower, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2888.1s)]
*  really beautiful flower, but in hindsight, probably the mushrooms had something to do with that. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2893.9s)]
*  So I just looked down at my phone, opened Twitter and it just looked like a vortex. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2901.6s)]
*  There was a very, very strange like it was like fragmenting at the edges, you know, like a like an actual vortex. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2912.1s)]
*  And it looked like extremely dark energy. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2922.0s)]
*  It's hard to describe it in sober wording, but it was, you know, at the time I would have just kind of felt this horrible kind of anxiety. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2927.1s)]
*  And I just there and then deleted the app and just put the phone down and just got on with my day and I didn't reinstall it. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2941.7s)]
*  And there were a couple of other things I did as well. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2952.2s)]
*  I did it with Instagram. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2953.7s)]
*  I did it with like because I just noticed that the phone and actually the phone itself was like just look like it was like [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2954.5s)]
*  charged with horrible, like nebulous, like dark energy, like felt like a black hole basically. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2961.4s)]
*  Yeah. And it felt like it was like drawing me towards it, but not in a good way, like in a way that made me feel like I was dying. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2968.2999999999997s)]
*  So I just thought, no, that's telling me something. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2976.5s)]
*  Right. You know, I also noticed the way my dog reacts to my phone. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2979.6s)]
*  He very often pulls it away, but also just just won't engage with it. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2983.7s)]
*  He'll only engage with me. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2990.9s)]
*  And if I'm engaging with it, then he'll he'll just kind of walk off. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2992.0s)]
*  Wow. So it's almost like here's a piece of life telling you, hey, man, that's not life. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=2995.9s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, that's what's very well put. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3000.6s)]
*  That's what's interesting about mushrooms, man. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3003.1s)]
*  I'll give you a little clue. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3004.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I did this ayahuasca treatment and I came home, right. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3005.7999999999997s)]
*  And I cut on like Dateline or something like Murder Show or something. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3009.1s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3013.1s)]
*  And yeah, probably. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3013.6s)]
*  Is that advised? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3015.7s)]
*  Was that, did your shaman tell you to do that? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3017.7999999999997s)]
*  I would say unadvised. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3022.1s)]
*  So I'd say I was working, you know, I was going off script. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3024.6s)]
*  Do you have another water too, Zach? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3028.7s)]
*  Do you mind, please? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3029.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3031.6s)]
*  So I was going off script, but I turned it on and everything in me was like, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3032.2s)]
*  don't you see how bad this is? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3037.0s)]
*  Someone died and you're sitting here watching it as like a wow. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3038.6s)]
*  And it wasn't it was it wasn't a Dateline episode. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3041.7999999999997s)]

*  But something that was like really dark. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3047.2999999999997s)]
*  So it kind of exposes the. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3049.7s)]
*  Thank you, mate. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3054.1s)]
*  Yeah, exposes sometimes like it's just a level of truth that I think [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3055.2999999999997s)]
*  the addictiveness of modern day society that we're not able to feel anymore. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3058.7s)]
*  And it almost feels like something that you would have felt like a long time ago [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3063.5s)]
*  and like your ancestral like. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3066.5s)]
*  Right. If you if you lived in a in a more sort of primitive like back in the day, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3068.6s)]
*  like more, you know, no technology. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3074.0s)]
*  And. And it's as if somebody handed to you then. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3076.7s)]
*  Yeah. You'd be like, this is and goes and goes. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3081.7s)]
*  You know, when you wake up, you're going to check this. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3088.4s)]
*  And you're going to scroll through all the things that are happening way outside of your group. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3091.9s)]
*  You're going to. You're going to check for the opinions of others. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3099.5s)]
*  And they're going to tell you how you're going to feel today. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3103.7000000000003s)]

*  They're not interactions with real people. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3119.7s)]
*  You're going to play games on this thing. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3121.1s)]

*  because this thing is going to stimulate you so much. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3144.3s)]

*  And I remember my girlfriend at the time, Megan, I think it was, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3351.7s)]
*  we came to see you perform at a church over in... [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3356.3999999999996s)]
*  The Presbyterian Church or was it... [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3361.6s)]
*  In downtown? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3363.3999999999996s)]
*  That wasn't the Wiltern. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3364.5s)]
*  It might be the Presbyterian Church. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3365.8999999999996s)]
*  It was like a cool nighttime show. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3368.1s)]
*  Was it actually a church? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3369.5s)]
*  I think it was. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3370.7s)]
*  Yeah, then it was Presbyterian, I think. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3372.8s)]
*  It was like some special show you were doing or something. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3375.0s)]
*  It was really amazing. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3377.0s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3378.0s)]
*  When I got into more of your music, I listened. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3379.0s)]
*  Like in the beginning, you had a lot of... [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3380.9s)]
*  Or I don't know the total beginning, but early on, some of the stuff you released, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3383.9s)]
*  like these EPs that had like... [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3387.4s)]
*  It was just a lot of beats and sounds and, you know, kind of wanderings. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3389.5s)]
*  Less like lead vocals, more kind of abstract, like collages of shit. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3393.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3398.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3399.4s)]
*  Was it scary to then put your voice out there? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3399.9s)]
*  Did you always know you were going to? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3402.0s)]
*  Because your voice is like a big thing, especially for someone who comes from a place of like, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3403.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, uncertainty or shyness or, you know, some of the realms that we've talked about, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3409.0s)]
*  like emotionally, like was that scary to put your voice out? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3413.9s)]
*  Or did it seem like just the next instrument you had? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3417.4s)]
*  It was. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3419.5s)]
*  I mean, there was a lot of toxic masculinity floating around, especially at that time. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3420.0s)]
*  But like, I remember when the first... [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3425.0s)]
*  Like one of my earliest memories was... [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3427.7s)]
*  I was upstairs in my parents' house and I was like 12 or 13 or something. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3433.2s)]
*  And I was playing... [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3441.4s)]
*  What I used to do, one of the ways I learned to train my ear, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3444.9s)]
*  which I didn't realize I was doing, but I just enjoyed doing it, was I'd play to records. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3448.6s)]
*  So I'd put a CD on and I'd sit at my keyboard, like, you know, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3453.6s)]
*  cheap, just piano keyboard thing, like electronic kind of thing. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3459.7s)]
*  Think Ross from Friends, you know, doing the thing, pressing the little drum thing and playing. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3463.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3471.7s)]
*  And then playing to the CD and learning all the like vocal runs and like learning how to play the chords [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3472.6s)]
*  and like Stevie Wonder and like Mariah Carey and all these people. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3479.7999999999997s)]
*  And I was playing at the time I was playing with the Whitney Houston song. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3483.3s)]
*  I can't remember the name of the song. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3489.6s)]
*  Very famous song. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3492.2s)]
*  I Will Always Love You, that? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3492.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3493.9s)]
*  It was... [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3494.8s)]
*  I believe the children of the future teach them well and let them leave the way. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3498.1s)]
*  They all look good in those glasses. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3504.9s)]
*  Yeah, I used to remember the lyrics. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3507.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3508.8s)]
*  So that one, I loved that song and I was playing it and the chords are amazing. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3509.7s)]
*  They're like very, you know, they're a tiny bit cheesy. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3516.1s)]
*  It's a bit of a cheesy song, but it's like one of the best ever. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3519.7s)]
*  She slightly cheesy songs, pop songs. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3523.7999999999997s)]
*  And so anyway, and I'm singing at the top of my lungs and the windows open. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3526.2s)]
*  And I've got a couple of friends who live four doors down. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3533.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3538.4s)]
*  I'm playing very loud. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3538.8s)]
*  I didn't realize the windows open. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3539.9s)]
*  Open the windows. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3541.5s)]
*  It's your first song on the radio, basically. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3542.2000000000003s)]
*  Basically. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3544.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3545.0s)]
*  And it's me. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3546.0s)]
*  It's me broadcasting this extremely kind of, I'd say at that point, you know, being [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3549.0s)]
*  a young man, very Billy Elliot type moment. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3554.8s)]
*  Very, very, very, yeah, like very like I'd say in terms of our understanding of masculinity [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3559.4s)]
*  at the time, not the most masculine thing I could be doing. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3569.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3572.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3573.3s)]
*  And I remember at the time, one of them shouting some homophobic slur from three [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3573.7000000000003s)]
*  doors down and just being like, you sound like blah, blah, blah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3580.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3585.7s)]
*  And, and it really like crushed me at the time because I didn't see music through a lens [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3586.3999999999996s)]
*  of like sexuality or, and I didn't see the problem in being gay or being bi or being [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3592.7999999999997s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3599.3999999999996s)]
*  I just was like, but I did understand that there was a social kind of rejection of being [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3600.1s)]
*  gay and a social, you know, all that. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3606.6s)]
*  And I just kind of froze and like, I started to associate music and singing with something [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3609.2000000000003s)]
*  shameful and feminine and like all these things that like were not, not accepted. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3619.7000000000003s)]
*  It went from like a hundred meter dash to like, just like hurdles now. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3625.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, now these, these different things have to make sure that they check enough of these. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3628.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3633.0s)]
*  Like don't be too, like don't be too, don't express yourself too much because then [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3633.3s)]
*  you're this and don't. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3637.2s)]
*  And so, you know, I sort of kept and it wasn't just that, but there was multiple reasons [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3638.7s)]
*  why and they really showed anyone that I sang. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3644.0s)]
*  I would go to the practice rooms at school every day and I was, you know, very often [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3647.5s)]
*  like extremely sad and depressed and kind of going in there and just playing and fucking [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3654.2s)]
*  crying and like being, you know, very British. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3660.5s)]
*  Is that British? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3664.0s)]
*  Extremely? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3664.6s)]
*  Well, no, the British thing to do is to, is to, is to not find an outlet at all and then [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3665.2999999999997s)]
*  just abuse somebody. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3672.6s)]
*  Whether it be, you know, physically or emotionally or, or indeed, you know, in any other way, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3677.1s)]
*  just, just find someone to, to kind of, or, or not even just someone, but everyone. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3682.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3690.1s)]
*  Just like make other people experience the pain that you're supposed to process. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3690.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3695.8s)]
*  So I actually found a way. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3696.4s)]
*  I found an outlet. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3699.5s)]
*  So I didn't have to like be a cunt to everyone else basically. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3701.2s)]
*  And I found myself just keeping it a secret. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3705.1s)]
*  That you had this talent. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3713.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3715.2s)]
*  Like, or that you were expressing yourself this way. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3715.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3717.6s)]
*  That I could sing and, and I could sing, you know, by that. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3717.9s)]
*  I was a good singer. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3720.4s)]
*  I was by the time I've been singing since I was two. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3721.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3726.0s)]
*  I mean, you hit some notes where I'm checking my watch. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3726.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm like, is this no going to end? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3727.9s)]
*  My gosh. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3730.6s)]
*  It's like waiting for a long train to pass. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3731.5s)]
*  I feel like those, one of those American trades. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3733.7000000000003s)]
*  Jesus come God. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3736.9s)]
*  This guy's just, I'm track this guy's riding this B flat north. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3738.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3745.0s)]
*  So, so that's, you know, like I ended up to cut a long story short. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3745.3s)]
*  Eventually I started a little bit singing in like school, like [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3750.5s)]
*  assemblies and shit, but I generally just kept it quiet. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3755.1000000000004s)]
*  And then when I was making music, I think I carried over that, that [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3758.2000000000003s)]
*  shame and I just, you know, the dance music scene was super male dominated. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3763.8s)]
*  And a lot of the discussion around it is like, it's very, it was very [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3770.5s)]
*  toxically masculine at the time. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3777.9s)]
*  And so when I started to sing, there were a lot of comments, a bit [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3780.3s)]
*  similar to what the guy had shouted at me three doors down, you know, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3785.2s)]
*  like just very like, and, but they, they couldn't say like, because, you [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3788.5s)]
*  know, things had moved on and, and, and they were adults and they were, they [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3794.4s)]
*  didn't want to like expose themselves as being homophobic or, or whatever, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3798.0s)]
*  but they were saying stuff that kind of like almost dog whistling, like [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3801.3s)]
*  you, you can't do this because that's this, you know, and kind of just [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3805.5s)]
*  discouraging me from expressing myself. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3811.8s)]
*  Basically, it's such a weird pattern of comfort that there's almost a [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3813.7s)]
*  comfort in people even doing that. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3816.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3818.4s)]
*  It's like this old thing. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3818.7s)]
*  It's like, you know, I would always envision like, there's a, there's some [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3819.7s)]
*  black kids on a white guy's lawn and the black guy comes out and yells [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3822.7s)]
*  the N word, but then he goes inside and he's learning the moonwalk. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3825.6s)]
*  You know, it's like, what's the analogy that I'm trying to, trying to put it [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3829.5s)]
*  together. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3832.6s)]
*  Do you want to understand what you mean? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3835.2s)]
*  I think it's that somebody will just say something that they like has [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3837.6s)]
*  been like part of a pattern. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3840.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3843.4s)]
*  But then they don't even realize they're going inside and now they're [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3843.9s)]
*  trying to learn like a black guy's day. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3846.7999999999997s)]
*  They've been practicing. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3848.7s)]
*  So the white guy is saying the N word or the black guy is the white [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3849.9s)]
*  guy or the white guy. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3852.5s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3853.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3853.9s)]
*  So they've, they're, they're culture, they're racially kind of living a [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3854.3s)]
*  double existence. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3858.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3859.9s)]
*  And you don't even realize it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3860.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like, they're not, they're like, they have like hate, they're saying [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3861.2000000000003s)]
*  hateful things, but ultimately they, they still, but they're also learning [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3865.3s)]
*  part of this culture. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3868.7000000000003s)]
*  They're learning like a music or a dance or something of this culture at the same time. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3869.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3873.7000000000003s)]
*  They're, they're confused basically. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3873.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3876.2000000000003s)]
*  Or just like some things are just patterns. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3876.4s)]
*  They're not the best patterns and you know, obviously, but some of the even [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3878.7000000000003s)]
*  things people say are just like, they don't know what else to say. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3881.8s)]
*  They're ingrained. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3884.3s)]
*  Also, they can be so deeply ingrained in people as a kind of like a form of [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3885.5s)]
*  expression that they're not even aware of what the words, what they mean. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3890.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3895.6s)]
*  What they, they lose. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3895.8s)]
*  There's a thing called semantic association where you, where in the moment [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3897.4s)]
*  you can say a word so many times that it loses its meaning completely. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3901.6s)]
*  And you know, like cactus, if you said that like 400 times in, or even probably [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3904.7s)]
*  10 times in a row, you start, it just starts to be a word that has no power [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3909.7s)]
*  whatsoever or any connotation. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3914.6s)]
*  It just becomes like a shape of sound. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3917.2s)]
*  We hear that even with music, you hear a song so many times. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3920.7s)]
*  It's like, Oh, I'm going to listen to this my whole road trip. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3922.8999999999996s)]
*  And then at the 30th time you're done, you know? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3925.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3929.5s)]
*  So is there another evolution you start to feel like for your music and not [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3930.7999999999997s)]
*  that you need one or anything, but. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3934.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think we always need one. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3936.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3938.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3938.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3938.7999999999997s)]
*  I always want to, but even by putting your voice in, right? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3939.2s)]
*  So at one point it was like, okay, I'm going to put my voice in like, yeah, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3941.9s)]
*  something new and different for me kind of, or, or put my voice out there to [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3944.7s)]
*  people attached to my music. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3948.5s)]
*  Um, do you feel like there's just, I'm just trying to think like, what would [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3951.1s)]
*  something else even look like, I guess, like a band or, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3956.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3959.7s)]
*  Well, you know, I, I kind of have a band we've played with live, but I, there is [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3960.2s)]
*  um, there's always a, a slight insecurity in me that like, I'm not [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3964.7s)]
*  shift, I'm not changing up enough. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3972.1s)]
*  The neck, every phase that we go into, like whether it's a new album or, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3974.3999999999996s)]
*  or something like that, but I've tended to find that the, the three-piece band [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3978.0s)]
*  that I play with is just the best for me. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3985.1s)]
*  And it's always kind of been that way. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3989.0s)]
*  Uh, and, but singing is like, it's a form of expression on like anything I've ever [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3991.0s)]
*  had, and I guess I just, I just love doing it and it really like, it feels great. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=3998.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's, it's, it just always, it's always challenging. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4004.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's like, even just staying on the note, like I have this voice where you, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4009.8999999999996s)]
*  I can kind of easily fall off the note and it almost sounds like I'm about to [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4015.3399999999997s)]
*  fall off the note, but I, but hopefully I don't sometimes I just do. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4019.2s)]
*  Um, but I don't have the most pure clear voice, you know, someone like Whitney [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4022.8999999999996s)]
*  Houston, for example, is just like, you know, super defined notes. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4029.3999999999996s)]
*  A lot of mine are quite, um, precarious. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4037.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4042.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a perfect example kind of a view. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4043.5s)]
*  It's I don't know, man. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4045.2s)]
*  It's really interesting to know you and hear your music. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4046.5s)]
*  Um, same with your comedy. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4049.6s)]
*  It's interesting to see. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4052.5s)]
*  It's kind of fascinating. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4053.8s)]
*  Cause it, one thing I always sort of, um, found fascinating was just how you've [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4054.6s)]
*  internalized your childhood and like the way people, like all of your memories of, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4062.3s)]
*  of all the stories you have of like where you grew up are so vivid. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4068.5s)]
*  I can't remember most of the people in my town. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4074.5s)]
*  I mean, I remember some of them, but I feel like we grew up in pretty [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4079.0s)]
*  different places and, and a lot of the things that you remember and pick up on [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4084.1000000000004s)]
*  of the people that you grew up around, maybe it's the way you're telling them, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4091.2000000000003s)]
*  but a lot of fucked up shit happened near you. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4096.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4102.2s)]
*  A lot of pervs. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4102.7s)]
*  I think we grew up around there. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4103.7s)]
*  A lot of people perving out. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4105.3s)]
*  Well, I think when people don't have much, they play with their body, you know, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4106.5s)]
*  or they're like, you know, you get reduced to kind of real limbic type of [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4109.9s)]
*  behaviors, you know, sexual or perved out or, you know, and especially you [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4113.1s)]
*  get out there in the rural areas where people aren't as educated, there's a lot [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4118.7s)]
*  more kind of, you know, I don't want to say incest, but people touching [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4121.9s)]
*  each other a little early. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4126.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4127.6s)]
*  You know, in that sort of behavior. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4127.9s)]
*  I grew up in, you know, the kind of the countryside or not. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4129.3s)]
*  It's not the countryside. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4132.8s)]
*  Did y'all have a horse or anything? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4133.7s)]
*  It was, yeah. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4134.900000000001s)]
*  Didn't have a horse. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4135.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4136.6s)]
*  That's where I draw the line. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4137.5s)]
*  I did meet a couple, but I didn't have a ride one. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4138.5s)]
*  And I just, I just, I'd like, there were characters where, where I was from. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4142.5s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4149.0s)]
*  But I think I don't, I guess I don't draw on them as inspiration because [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4150.7s)]
*  they probably, I probably avoided most people, I think. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4155.7s)]
*  Oh, whereas I think you must've just been more like viscerally attached. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4158.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4163.7s)]
*  We were more loose out just seeing stuff, you know, not much like supervision [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4164.3s)]
*  or like, and I didn't want to be at home. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4169.099999999999s)]
*  My father was so old. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4171.3s)]
*  My mother was gone. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4172.5s)]
*  There was like a clean, there was like a babysitter around. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4173.5s)]
*  So it was just so like, I don't know. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4177.099999999999s)]
*  It's just, just being out and about, you know, and I think it's just, it's [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4179.5s)]
*  just being out and about, you know, and then your imagination becomes so big [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4183.9s)]
*  because you, something needs to have some value to you. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4188.2s)]
*  So your imagination creates like a lot, like I think it pays attention to [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4192.099999999999s)]
*  a lot of stuff and it, uh, you attached it. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4196.5s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4201.0s)]
*  It wants you to have a bigger world. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4202.299999999999s)]
*  So your, maybe your imagination gets attached to something else inside [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4203.9s)]
*  of you and they kind of gross anonymously maybe. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4207.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4209.9s)]
*  Because do you feel like when you go into rooms with people in like Hollywood [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4210.2s)]
*  or, or, or even just any way you are, do you feel like your imagination is sort [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4215.0s)]
*  of overgrown in a way that there's hasn't? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4219.599999999999s)]
*  Do you, do you sometimes feel like, uh, like you've still got the curiosity [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4222.0s)]
*  of about people and about like things that a lot of people seem to have, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4228.599999999999s)]
*  like you have quite a, um, quite a zest for that kind of thing that like a lot [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4234.8s)]
*  of people don't seem to, don't seem to have like an opposite, you know, you're, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4242.4s)]
*  you're keen to like observe the, the thing that a lot of people wouldn't have [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4246.4s)]
*  noticed, which, you know, is, I mean, that in itself is like a, is like a, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4250.8s)]
*  a love of life. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4257.0s)]
*  It's not even though like, I know that you've gone through a lot and you've, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4257.8s)]
*  and you've talked about, you know, bouts of depression and bouts of kind of not [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4261.8s)]
*  being interested and stuff, but it's like even at your least interested, even [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4265.4s)]
*  at your least engaged with humanity and everything, you still seem so curious. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4269.0s)]
*  Well, thanks, man. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4275.0s)]
*  I think, um, well, some of it is, I think you have to, you start to develop a [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4275.7s)]
*  sense, I need to know what is very important to this person that's in front [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4281.599999999999s)]
*  of me right now, because if I need them, right, or if I need to let them know, I [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4285.4s)]
*  need communication from them or I need them to see me, I need to be able to get [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4291.0s)]
*  to them immediately. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4295.6s)]
*  So maybe there's a part in you that it's like, Oh, you can tell this about them [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4297.3s)]
*  or you can tell this, or you could, you know, see by the way that they turn [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4301.5s)]
*  their neck or fix their hair or put something in their pocket that you can [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4305.7s)]
*  envision this bigger world behind them, that you can either make a way for it [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4309.8s)]
*  to be funny to them or it can be really acute to them. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4314.7s)]
*  And it can be very factual. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4317.5s)]
*  Maybe sometimes I think it's developed. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4319.5s)]
*  I think you just developed a sense in case I need someone. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4321.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4325.099999999999s)]
*  Um, I need everything I can get to show this person that I may, that I can attach [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4325.3s)]
*  to them like a, like a, like a, um, like a detective. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4331.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4336.099999999999s)]
*  I think a part of you kind of become some type of a detective, you know, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4336.8s)]
*  because it's like you're noticing stuff on people, you know, it's like when in [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4339.5s)]
*  detective shows where they're like, yeah, well, you know, his, his right, but his [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4342.599999999999s)]
*  right shoe had a lace untied, which means that recently he was, it's like, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4346.2s)]
*  he's the kind of person you he's, he's not, no, he's, he doesn't have OCD. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4351.4s)]
*  He's not, he's, you know, he's not paying attention. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4355.0s)]
*  He's, he's loose. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4357.4s)]
*  He can, he can't be trusted, but you know, it's like, they'll draw all these [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4358.8s)]
*  conclusions from just that one aspect of someone's, uh, appearance or something. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4361.599999999999s)]
*  Or you would also do it on the other side. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4366.8s)]
*  You would know what could hurt that person. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4368.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4370.5s)]
*  You know, right. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4371.099999999999s)]
*  And you could never used that and then regretted it. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4371.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4374.3s)]
*  I think growing up, especially as a defense mechanism, you would use it [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4374.8s)]
*  around our house, like with communicating with my brothers and sisters. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4378.5s)]
*  It was the only way we communicate. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4381.8s)]
*  It was a very rudely, uh, making fun. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4383.2s)]
*  There was no like affection. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4388.400000000001s)]
*  Nobody like taught us. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4389.900000000001s)]
*  You got to be brothers and said there was no, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4391.7s)]
*  so you just find the thing that you thought was going to like cut them down, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4394.400000000001s)]
*  calm down and just, I just, just go for it right when they walk in the door. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4397.5s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4401.0s)]
*  So it was every, I mean, it was just, I was surprised that you didn't, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4401.5s)]
*  um, sort of comment on this ridiculous onesie that I'm wearing. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4404.5s)]
*  Well, we've only had one other person that's worn something like that. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4410.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4412.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4415.7s)]
*  But he dressed like a train conductor. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4416.2s)]
*  Bring up Robbie Williams. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4417.799999999999s)]

*  He was really on this podcast. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4429.599999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4432.299999999999s)]
*  He looks like he's basically dressed as except I, so he's wearing a, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4433.4s)]
*  we're both wearing dungarees, but I look like I've grown through mine. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4437.9s)]
*  Like just an extra two foot up because mine are lower. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4442.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4447.599999999999s)]
*  But he came in. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4448.2s)]
*  I mean, he definitely looked like, Hey, you're late for the train. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4448.9s)]
*  You know, he definitely came in like he's got conductor on it written [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4451.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4456.2s)]
*  He had kind of a sling blade gets a job at Amtrak sort of vibe going on. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4456.4s)]
*  I'm track with a, with an Apple watch. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4460.5s)]
*  Definitely not going to be late. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4463.4s)]
*  Never be late again. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4465.099999999999s)]
*  But it was great. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4468.9s)]
*  I haven't seen Robbie Williams in a long time. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4470.599999999999s)]
*  He's he looks great. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4472.2s)]
*  I think he's the only other British person. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4473.2s)]
*  Oh, and Michael Bisping. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4475.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4476.799999999999s)]
*  So three, three really interesting different British people that [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4477.599999999999s)]
*  we've had on here. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4481.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4482.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4483.4s)]
*  Only three Brits. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4483.9s)]
*  I think so. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4485.099999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to think of maybe a different one. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4486.0s)]
*  Is that a Max Moore was from Britain. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4487.7s)]
*  Oh, Max Moore. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4489.9s)]
*  He does the cryonic freezing where they freeze people. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4490.8s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4495.6s)]
*  Or is he the freezer or the freezy? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4496.2s)]
*  He is the freezer. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4498.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4500.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4500.8s)]
*  He's the freezer. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4501.0s)]
*  He's never been. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4501.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4502.8s)]
*  I think he would, he himself is planning on getting frozen. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4503.0s)]
*  I think, but it was just interesting to learn. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4505.400000000001s)]
*  He's never done it himself. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4506.7s)]
*  I would never go to someone who's never done it. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4507.8s)]
*  There's only one way to do it. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4509.900000000001s)]
*  You have to die. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4510.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4512.6s)]
*  It's that thing. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4512.900000000001s)]
*  That's the thing you have to die and then you go in. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4513.5s)]
*  Wait. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4515.5s)]
*  So he freezes people who are dead. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4515.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4518.1s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4519.3s)]
*  They catch them right when they're about to die. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4519.8s)]
*  That's why he's never done it. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4521.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4522.3s)]
*  I got it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4522.5s)]
*  So yeah, there's only one entry point. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4523.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4525.5s)]
*  It seems, yeah, it seems niche. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4526.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4527.8s)]
*  Guess he's, I think that's a good way to say it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4530.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4532.3s)]
*  So what, what was his, I'd love to know what his chat was like. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4533.4s)]
*  Is it, I mean, I could just go and watch the podcast. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4536.2s)]
*  I guess. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4538.0s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4538.2s)]
*  His name is Max Moore. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4538.9s)]
*  So he also is named like a super villain type of name. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4540.599999999999s)]
*  M-A-X-M-O-R-E. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4543.3s)]
*  So he really lives this, you know, and he looks, bring a picture of him up. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4544.9s)]
*  He looks like he's been damn frozen and thought out 30 times. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4549.3s)]
*  He looks like they wanted him for dinner and then change their mind. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4552.5s)]
*  But he looks like Bill Burr. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4555.8s)]
*  Like, I mean, he's just been in the frozen. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4558.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4560.7s)]
*  There he is. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4561.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4561.6s)]
*  He does look like Bill Burr. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4561.900000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4563.8s)]
*  He looks like he really. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4564.3s)]
*  It's sort of a Wim Hof and Bill Burr had a. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4566.1s)]
*  Heavy on the whim, I think. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4569.2s)]
*  This dude is, but very interesting. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4572.0s)]
*  He's the, he's the, the post. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4574.8s)]
*  Um, he's the posthumous Wim Hof in a way, isn't it? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4577.599999999999s)]
*  Just with the freezing. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4580.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4581.599999999999s)]
*  They're both dealing the same thing. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4582.0s)]
*  He keeps them all. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4583.2s)]
*  They just, you know, they have all the bodies and that sort of deal. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4584.0s)]
*  Real interesting. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4587.7s)]
*  He's for, if things with Wim Hof, Wim Hof go wrong. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4588.5s)]
*  He's your guy, I think. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4592.3s)]
*  And they freeze them in like this different type of, um, what was that [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4593.9s)]
*  stuff called, Zach, do you remember? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4597.099999999999s)]
*  Uh, it's a certain type of gas. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4600.2s)]
*  I forget the name of it. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4601.7s)]
*  It's quite scary. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4603.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4605.0s)]
*  It's scary. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4605.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4606.0s)]
*  But his plan, his thought is this, that if people like already [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4606.6s)]
*  they can take an embryo, right? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4610.3s)]
*  They can say if your girlfriend wanted to donate eggs, right? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4611.7s)]
*  And then they froze those eggs, which they do for a lot of women now. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4614.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4617.7s)]
*  They're basically freezing life. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4618.3s)]
*  Before. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4620.7s)]
*  So he's saying that they could freeze you at the end also. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4621.9s)]
*  And then later when they have the technology, if you're still alive, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4626.1s)]
*  people are hoping that, you know, we can get revived like a mammoth. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4630.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4633.7s)]
*  And he's saying, why not? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4633.9s)]
*  Because at one point people thought climbing up a ladder was as high [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4634.7s)]
*  as you could get to something. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4637.2s)]
*  And then now we, you know, we can travel through space. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4638.599999999999s)]
*  So that's really, I mean, I, I imagine the ladder was probably [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4641.9s)]
*  invented after like, uh, some of the space travel, not space travel, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4646.599999999999s)]
*  but maybe the hypothesis, just maybe the whole airplane. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4654.7s)]
*  I didn't think about that. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4655.0s)]
*  I don't really know which came first. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4656.099999999999s)]
*  Do you imagine when somebody showed up with that ladder, bro? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4657.8s)]
*  Damn. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4660.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4661.4s)]
*  Oh. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4663.4s)]
*  People imagine all the chicks he got to all those rung honeys. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4664.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4668.7s)]
*  I mean, it would feel, it felt like a celebrity. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4670.0s)]
*  I imagined it locally. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4672.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4674.0s)]
*  Hey, he's coming over. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4674.3s)]
*  He's bringing it. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4675.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4676.099999999999s)]
*  People with all the things like on their shelves that they can't reach. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4677.599999999999s)]
*  People was hiding stuff up way high. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4681.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4682.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4683.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4683.4s)]
*  See it. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4683.599999999999s)]
*  Look at him go. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4684.9s)]
*  Just imagining how his life panned out. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4686.099999999999s)]
*  If he, if he, um, the inventor of the ladder, like, did he get royalties? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4688.9s)]
*  Did he get? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4693.8s)]
*  No, I'm sure. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4694.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4695.8s)]
*  The dark side of it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4695.900000000001s)]
*  Then watching people go get stuff and you're not making anything off it. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4696.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4700.7s)]
*  You're wandering around. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4700.900000000001s)]
*  Curt, you know, you're cursing at people who are climbing up. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4702.2s)]
*  Could have been a better older man. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4705.7s)]
*  I imagine. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4707.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'd watch that movie. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4708.0s)]
*  I'd watch the, I'd watch that. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4709.400000000001s)]
*  There's a movie in it. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4710.7s)]
*  I think that would be a very bad movie. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4712.0s)]
*  It'd be a, yeah. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4714.3s)]
*  It's sad movie. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4716.8s)]
*  I think you and I can make a really good sad movie. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4721.1s)]
*  Probably. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4723.1s)]
*  I think so. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4723.6s)]
*  I imagine. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4724.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4724.6s)]
*  Combine both of our early lives. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4724.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4727.3s)]
*  We put it together. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4727.7s)]
*  So what, what about your early life? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4729.1s)]
*  Do you, was a lot of your pressure from just like acceptance or your [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4730.400000000001s)]
*  peers, because obviously if you were kind of shy and music was your [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4734.900000000001s)]
*  scapegoat and you had these skills that were kind of frowned upon, which [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4738.8s)]
*  certainly are in certain areas, you know, um, it makes you wonder how [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4743.400000000001s)]
*  much creativity has been really stifled by an environment. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4747.400000000001s)]
*  You know, I think, you know, sometimes I thought it was [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4750.400000000001s)]
*  the singing, the fact that, you know, kids just didn't really, but [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4753.2s)]
*  it's also a bit like, I think it's a bit like being a footballer, right? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4757.0s)]
*  You know, when a kid says I want to be a professional, you know, soccer [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4761.0s)]
*  player when I'm older in England, that's like, you know, NFL here, you [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4764.5s)]
*  know, it's this almost unattainable dream that some people do genuinely [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4769.099999999999s)]
*  break through and make it, but it's, you know, if a kid says that's [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4775.9s)]
*  what they want to do, you go, well, people go like, okay, but have a [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4779.5s)]
*  backup plan because probably not going to happen. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4785.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4788.0s)]
*  And music's a bit like that where it's like, the odds are you're not going [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4788.599999999999s)]
*  to be the, you're not going to be a superstar. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4793.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4797.2s)]
*  And you're probably not even going to make it as high as you want to. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4797.7s)]
*  Uh, even if you do become extremely successful because it's never enough. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4800.599999999999s)]
*  So ultimately convincing people to go into music for a living is, is [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4805.2s)]
*  actually slightly, uh, kind of a dubious thing to suggest because [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4814.0s)]
*  it's, it's really hard and most people don't, you know, make it, uh, but [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4819.3s)]
*  also there's, there's also loads of ways you can be involved in music [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4827.8s)]
*  don't, you know, um, don't have so much pressure on them and you can make [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4831.0s)]
*  a living, you can make a great living from music and not be famous and [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4835.9s)]
*  not be in the band and not be in the, you know, you can be working music [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4839.2s)]
*  in so many different ways. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4843.5s)]
*  Um, but they're not the ways that people focus on when they think of [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4845.2s)]
*  musician or whatever they think of like the famous ones. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4849.5s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4854.599999999999s)]
*  They're not some of the most, uh, like, uh, ways that are kind of, they're [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4855.4s)]
*  not the front man. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4860.1s)]
*  You think of the front front people, you know, I don't, it's just advertising. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4862.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4865.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4866.0s)]
*  Um, what other things do you think about with music? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4866.700000000001s)]
*  Are there other worlds that you'd like to conquer? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4869.3s)]
*  Like you've had such a, you know, you've gotten to work with like Travis [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4871.0s)]
*  Scott and, uh, Beyonce, you've won a Grammy, right? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4873.8s)]
*  For best rap performance. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4877.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4879.8s)]
*  Was that right? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4880.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4882.0s)]
*  I mean, it was weird. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4882.3s)]
*  I was actually on the way to the Grammys and they told me in the car that [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4884.3s)]
*  I'd won one, uh, for best rap performance. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4887.3s)]
*  And I, so, so essentially it's on this. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4889.5s)]
*  So on, so Kendrick Lamar, we were supposed to work on, he asked me to [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4893.0s)]
*  work on the Black Panther stuff, the soundtrack, and then also there [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4901.400000000001s)]
*  was this other song he was doing, which I think ended up on the Black [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4907.1s)]
*  Panther soundtrack as well as King's Dead. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4911.2s)]
*  And I sent him this, this thing. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4913.5s)]
*  It was going to be like maybe a verse. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4916.9s)]
*  I don't really know what it was, but I tried something on this song. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4918.099999999999s)]
*  He wanted me to try and be, try and be on it. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4921.299999999999s)]
*  Anyway, they ended up using like a very, very, very small clip of what I'd done. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4923.9s)]
*  It was like a couple of seconds and putting a lot of effects on it. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4928.799999999999s)]
*  So I, I wasn't particularly audible or it wasn't necessarily recognizably me. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4932.799999999999s)]
*  Now, obviously I don't care like that. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4938.5s)]
*  It worked really well in the song. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4940.9s)]
*  Like they did a great job. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4942.4s)]
*  And I wasn't in any way like cut up about that. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4944.0s)]
*  Like I just was like, nice to be included, sample me, cool, whatever you want to do. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4948.3s)]
*  But anyway, they ended up putting my name on the song as one of the features. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4953.400000000001s)]
*  Now, usually a feature is something like someone does a verse or like that, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4958.6s)]
*  you know, whatever. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4961.900000000001s)]
*  So anyway, I'm this thing and I'm not really playing a feature role, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4962.900000000001s)]
*  but I'm, my name's on it. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4970.6s)]
*  So I win a Grammy. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4972.8s)]
*  They win a Grammy for the song. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4974.2s)]
*  And because my name's on the actual song, rather than just like buried in the [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4975.900000000001s)]
*  credits as a sample, you got to go. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4980.1s)]
*  I actually get a Grammy. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4981.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4982.6s)]
*  So I've got a, and it says best rap performance, which insinuates that I rap, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4983.2s)]
*  which you can imagine I don't. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4987.8s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4992.8s)]
*  Cause sometimes you would think, man, they put my name on here. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4993.6s)]
*  I'm not even really on here. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4996.3s)]
*  This kind of mess. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4997.400000000001s)]
*  Some people might think it's kind of messed up. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4998.2s)]
*  They're kind of using me here. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=4999.6s)]
*  But then it's funny how sometimes things turn around and it's like, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5000.8s)]
*  oh, here you go. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5003.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was just funny. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5004.400000000001s)]
*  It was just a whole, the whole situation was funny. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5005.5s)]
*  Like I didn't, you know, cause we ended up doing other songs. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5007.6s)]
*  So it was like, if, if that had been all they used, then maybe I could [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5010.6s)]
*  have felt a bit sad about it. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5014.400000000001s)]
*  But you know, you've also got to think like the man's a legend. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5016.3s)]
*  The situation is legendary. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5021.2s)]
*  Like the song went, was a hit. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5022.900000000001s)]
*  It went multi-platinum. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5024.400000000001s)]
*  Like I was just like, cool. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5025.3s)]
*  Like amazing. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5028.3s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5029.4s)]
*  I'm happy to be involved at all, but the, uh, yeah, just the Grammy's funny. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5030.2s)]
*  I mean, it's currently hidden behind a big modular synth, um, in my studio. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5034.7s)]
*  Poking out the back. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5042.5s)]
*  When you have, is your studio now fancier than your studio when you first started? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5044.7s)]
*  A little bit, but it's still pretty much the same principle. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5049.2s)]
*  Just a keyboard, computer, mic. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5052.099999999999s)]
*  Uh, it's just like probably higher end versions of those things, but quite [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5055.299999999999s)]
*  simple, quite small, because sometimes I think like, is it hard to get back to [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5061.2s)]
*  like them because sometimes we look to our early stuff and like, those are the [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5065.2s)]
*  moments where I really wish I could just still feel like myself, you know, I even [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5068.299999999999s)]
*  will have old podcast clips come up and I'm like, oh man, that's when I was just [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5072.4s)]
*  really felt like in the pocket of who I was as a person before I started to take [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5076.5s)]
*  any input from people's perspectives of me or before stuff got out there and [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5081.6s)]
*  anybody knew who I was when who I was, what was a secret to me. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5086.200000000001s)]
*  And I was my, it was like, it was almost like I had some value for myself that [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5090.3s)]
*  once everybody knows about it, it's almost like, you don't not still have it, but [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5096.6s)]
*  it's not yours as much anymore. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5100.5s)]
*  No. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5102.1s)]
*  And you've, and you've kind of shown your, you shown your cards, shown [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5102.400000000001s)]
*  your cards basically. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5106.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5107.1s)]
*  There's something, there's something so special about being a surprise. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5107.5s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5110.6s)]
*  And the underdog and I like all these things and like, there was a time I [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5111.6s)]
*  imagined where it felt like you were people just kind of discovering your [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5115.0s)]
*  brain and how it works and kind of going, whoa, never heard anyone say anything [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5119.6s)]
*  like this or do anything like this. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5124.900000000001s)]
*  But you know, that's a cool moment. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5126.5s)]
*  But I think that your career especially has kind of been littered with really [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5133.700000000001s)]
*  great moments that couldn't have happened during that phase. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5137.900000000001s)]
*  Like now you have this incredible fan base of people who love the way your [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5141.6s)]
*  brain works and know the way your brain works and look for, and look for [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5147.700000000001s)]
*  confirmation about how great you are. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5152.700000000001s)]
*  And, and they, they're like, they're watching because they can count on you [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5155.3s)]
*  to make them feel that thing that you make them feel. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5163.5s)]
*  And, and then also not just laugh, but also be understood and like ask [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5165.6s)]
*  questions that they are too afraid to ask. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5169.4s)]
*  And you know, you, you get to meet all these people that they don't get to [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5171.0s)]
*  meet and they can see it through your lens and every new person you meet [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5174.2s)]
*  brings something new hour new. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5180.5s)]
*  So there's never, um, there's never been a point at which you were more [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5182.299999999999s)]
*  capable of doing that than right now. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5188.2s)]
*  It feels the other way though. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5191.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5193.299999999999s)]
*  Talking about in what way? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5193.599999999999s)]
*  Like, do you ever feel like I want, God, I wish I could go back to whatever. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5195.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a, it's, um, but you can't get your brain back there. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5198.8s)]
*  Like your brain, like your reality grows and you can't go back, you know? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5202.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5208.1s)]
*  And I think, I think that's a good thing because what you probably, what [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5208.6s)]
*  we, you know, I have a similar thing and I look back at some of my old music and [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5215.400000000001s)]
*  I think like, Oh, like I was thinking so much simpler back then, or I really [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5219.700000000001s)]
*  knew how to do this or like, I didn't overcomplicate or. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5225.200000000001s)]
*  You know, there were, Oh yeah. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5229.0s)]
*  Like I really had a fire in my belly for this type of thing. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5230.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5233.3s)]
*  And that's cool. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5233.700000000001s)]
*  But that moment really only lasted for however long it lasted. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5236.700000000001s)]
*  And then after that I had to, and I was finding a fire for other things. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5239.900000000001s)]
*  And I think obviously we can't revisit moments in time, but what we can do [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5243.8s)]
*  is make sure that our head is clear and that we're on our path. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5254.0s)]
*  Cause I think the feeling that we miss is the feeling of being on our path. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5258.6s)]
*  It's not necessarily the thing we were doing at the time, what we were on our [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5264.0s)]
*  path, that we were on our path. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5268.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5269.5s)]
*  It's I am doing what I'm here to do. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5270.0s)]
*  I'm exactly where I should be in the universe. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5276.6s)]
*  And I am being so, I mean, being integral. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5279.700000000001s)]
*  I'm not letting other people's opinions get to me. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5284.6s)]
*  I'm pursuing what it is. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5287.2s)]
*  I love, I'm being authentic and I'm enjoying every moment and I'm, and I'm being present. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5290.0s)]
*  When you feel those things, the content you put out is going to be great. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5301.3s)]
*  And it will always be a moment people look back on because ultimately the [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5311.2s)]
*  thing that brought you to where you are now, sorry, into even into, you know, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5315.3s)]
*  public consciousness was the fact that you were on that path and your every [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5320.5s)]
*  essence, your actual essence is why you're there. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5329.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5332.0s)]
*  It's every, it's the way you look at the world. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5332.5s)]
*  It's all the things that led to this. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5334.3s)]
*  It's your childhood. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5335.8s)]
*  It's the thing, the ways that you learn to kind of put those experiences into [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5336.7s)]
*  words or the way you learn to, you know, find those. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5342.6s)]
*  So it's not like getting back to a certain doc. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5347.6s)]
*  It's just like being still just be in the stream kind of, or getting, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5349.8s)]
*  it's like that's in flow state. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5356.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5358.700000000001s)]
*  It's finding flow state. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5359.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, cause I always, I always mess up and think it's, oh, I got to get back to this doc. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5360.8s)]
*  But it's like, no, that doc was just part of something you passed by as you were in [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5366.3s)]
*  a comfortable, healthy self. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5371.9s)]
*  That was part of the scenery. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5373.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5374.7s)]
*  I believe, I mean, that's what I believe anyway. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5375.599999999999s)]
*  This is, I'm, this is, uh, I'm always looking out the window thinking, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5377.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, I got to get back to where the car passed, but really I just have to [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5380.7s)]
*  get back into this comfortably in the driver's seat. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5384.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5386.799999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5387.5s)]
*  I think so. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5389.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5390.4s)]
*  And it's such a fight to try and think, how do I get back there? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5390.599999999999s)]
*  You know, and then you're always working from a loss because it's impossible. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5394.599999999999s)]
*  It's the, it's the kind of content, it's the Buddhist concept of, uh, you [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5398.599999999999s)]
*  know, desire is suffering. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5402.5s)]
*  It's like, if you, if you want what you don't currently embody, then you are [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5403.599999999999s)]
*  starting from a point of deficit. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5412.2s)]
*  You don't have the thing. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5415.2s)]
*  So therefore, you know, wanting something equals unhappiness, but you're, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5416.5s)]
*  but I mean, that's, I think, no, it's good. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5424.4s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5427.0s)]
*  I have to pee really bad to you. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5427.900000000001s)]
*  I really do. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5429.1s)]
*  All right. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5429.900000000001s)]
*  Let's pee and then we'll come back and maybe talk about some news. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5430.0s)]
*  Thanks for releasing me. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5432.1s)]
*  Would you ever, uh, and then you got, it gets much colder in Britain, huh? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5433.5s)]
*  Much colder. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5438.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5438.900000000001s)]
*  Well, actually I say that, I mean, America's a big place and gets much [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5439.700000000001s)]
*  colder in Minnesota than it does anywhere in England. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5444.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, do you ever feel like you've sold out your country by moving out of it? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5447.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5452.900000000001s)]
*  And maybe that's not the best term to you. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5454.6s)]
*  That's just a general term. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5455.900000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, it's definitely like, you know, as an English person, it's [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5456.9s)]
*  definitely like a concern that you in some way have insulted your, you [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5460.599999999999s)]
*  know, your own by moving out. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5466.0s)]
*  But no, I never felt like I lived anywhere. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5467.5s)]
*  To be honest, I do feel English. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5472.4s)]
*  I mean, all my cultural reference points are English and all my comedy, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5474.0s)]
*  uh, comedy references and musical. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5478.7s)]
*  Any botanist would find roots of you there. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5483.9s)]
*  You'd be busted there. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5486.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5487.8s)]
*  But that's interesting. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5488.7s)]
*  Music, musical roots were a lot of it was American. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5489.9s)]
*  And a lot of like other like Japanese and, uh, like European, uh, music and [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5492.9s)]
*  you know, just, yeah, those are different cultural influences that were not [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5499.7s)]
*  English and, and also I think on a spiritual level, I just didn't really [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5504.2s)]
*  resonate with nationality particularly. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5508.599999999999s)]
*  I didn't really have a national pride particularly, or, you know, being [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5510.7s)]
*  English is complex, isn't it? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5515.900000000001s)]
*  And it's, you know, it comes with a history that's not necessarily, um, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5517.700000000001s)]
*  you know, some of it's great and some of it's quite shameful. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5522.400000000001s)]
*  And some of it, you know, I don't understand why I would really attach [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5524.900000000001s)]
*  myself to the positive or the negative of my country's history when I wasn't [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5530.400000000001s)]
*  part of it. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5535.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5536.5s)]
*  It's interesting, you know, with history, it's interesting because [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5536.700000000001s)]
*  it's like people, it's easy to look back on history and be like, oh, this is, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5538.5s)]
*  you know, this wasn't good, you know, from present perspectives and stuff [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5541.5s)]
*  like that. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5545.4s)]
*  And, and, you know, I'm sure at the time, a lot of British people were [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5545.9s)]
*  like, we're taking over the world. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5550.7s)]
*  You know, it was like a different, like, there was probably a pride that [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5552.0s)]
*  would seem foolish now if somebody had it, you know, like, it would seem, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5555.2s)]
*  you know, it's, it's just interesting how time gives shape to things. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5559.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5563.0s)]
*  Cause all of our sort of, uh, reach of power is kind of just like slowly. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5563.099999999999s)]
*  And now we're just this little Island, uh, that has, you know, a lot of [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5567.3s)]
*  cultural power and I guess some financial power, but I, we're, we're [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5573.7s)]
*  definitely, um, maybe got a tail between our legs a little bit, uh, might, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5577.3s)]
*  might, might account for some of the self-deprecation that happens. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5583.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5586.5s)]
*  I think maybe a historical tail between your legs. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5586.7s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5588.900000000001s)]
*  I'm curious to see, like, how does Britain kind of like, how do they [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5589.2s)]
*  feel okay to show their still show who they are or find who they are? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5593.4s)]
*  I think with a little bit of difficulty, actually, I think, I think like when [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5598.5s)]
*  you have a national kind of sense of like something, you know, we're not [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5601.7s)]
*  like, we've not always been part of, you know, the, you know, the British [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5605.799999999999s)]
*  empire, like the colonialism we're, we're, you know, I think finding [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5609.5s)]
*  pride has to come from other, obviously other sources, unless you genuinely [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5614.799999999999s)]
*  are proud of that, in which case, don't know how I can't help you, but, but [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5620.1s)]
*  that, this, this side of being English, like the comedy, the, the kind of, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5624.200000000001s)]
*  um, the music, the culture, the cultural output of England is really amazing. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5631.6s)]
*  I mean, I look back at, you know, a lot of my biggest influences have [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5638.700000000001s)]
*  also been, uh, English bands. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5642.900000000001s)]
*  Um, it's funny. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5645.5s)]
*  I mean, I, I didn't actually really, wasn't really, um, like a fan of [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5647.1s)]
*  Oasis at the time, but I went to, I'm a big Beatles fan. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5652.2s)]
*  Um, lots of, lots of bands kind of eluded me until I was a bit older [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5656.4s)]
*  because I mostly listened to piano based music, uh, and. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5660.0s)]
*  Like Mozart. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5664.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5666.3s)]
*  Whether it was classical or I listened to, um, a lot of like, like soul [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5666.5s)]
*  classical, um, Japanese kind of ambient type. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5674.599999999999s)]
*  Like Kabuki or something. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5680.5s)]
*  Is that like, uh, I don't know what that is, but I, um, I don't either. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5681.7s)]
*  So, yeah, but, but no, I mean, it could be a genre though. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5687.2s)]
*  I, I, it's something I don't know about, but, uh, yeah. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5690.799999999999s)]
*  So, I mean, um, Ryoichi Sakamoto is a good, good, uh, example. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5695.5s)]
*  You should listen to him. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5700.799999999999s)]

*  I think this is like. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5807.1s)]
*  That's very Japanese. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5810.0s)]

*  But I wear a lot of Japanese clothes because I just think they, I mean, Yamamoto [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5819.2s)]
*  and Issey Miyake are like my favorite designers. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5827.2s)]

*  And, and you know, going back to when I was a kid, yeah, lots of, lots of Japanese [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5832.099999999999s)]
*  music and, and I think I was also fascinated by like, like Western and [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5836.8s)]
*  Japanese crossovers and just like the intersection between those sounds. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5843.2s)]
*  And one thing you find is that every, every culture has its kind of own [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5854.5s)]
*  chord kind of or tonality. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5860.3s)]
*  What's the word sort of like world of notes that, that sound good together in [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5864.0s)]
*  that, you know, style. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5868.6s)]
*  So for example, in French music, right. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5870.0s)]
*  So like French, a classical or whatever it's like, there's a, there's a, there's [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5875.8s)]

*  That's funny. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5911.299999999999s)]
*  If you know a lot about music, you're probably able to hear a lot of different [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5911.799999999999s)]
*  like little just things in the world and know like trace them back. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5914.7s)]

*  Like, if you know sounds, it's almost like when you learn Latin. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5918.799999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5921.700000000001s)]
*  Everything's rooted in something. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5922.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5923.400000000001s)]

*  stations and shit that they have. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5928.0s)]

*  That's kind of amazing. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5935.1s)]
*  Do you think, do you notice any difference between the audiences like in [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5937.0s)]
*  different places, like in some of the behavior of them and stuff like that? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5942.5s)]
*  Japan's a really interesting place to play because a lot of the audiences [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5945.0s)]
*  are, they're like super respectful. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5950.200000000001s)]
*  At least for the shows that we've put on, they'll be completely silent during [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5954.5s)]
*  the music and then erupt in like the loudest possible applause. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5959.5s)]
*  And then as soon as they sense that you're ready to start the next [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5964.5s)]
*  song, complete silence again, like penny drop. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5967.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5970.200000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5970.700000000001s)]
*  Does it feel crazy? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5971.6s)]
*  It feels. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5973.0s)]
*  Or does it feel like right? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5974.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5976.0s)]
*  It's just different. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5976.5s)]
*  It's like, it feels right there, but it's so, I can understand the logic behind [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5977.4s)]
*  it and there's a such respect that comes with that. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5985.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, they really, really respect the art and what you're doing. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5989.099999999999s)]
*  And also we were there, you know, we're kind of, we don't go there very often. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5994.799999999999s)]
*  So, and you're not, you know, if you go too often, I think they probably get [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=5998.5s)]
*  bored of you and you start to seem domestic almost, but they respond, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6002.6s)]
*  especially like that, I think to people who are from out of town who come in [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6007.2s)]
*  and just kind of, um, more of a rarity. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6011.3s)]
*  It's like, they just really want to be present for the. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6015.1s)]
*  I don't want to miss it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6017.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6018.9s)]
*  You want to be in the moment? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6019.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6020.6s)]
*  Maybe the value of the moment a bit more, maybe there's some more of a [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6021.9s)]
*  value for the moment. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6025.7s)]
*  They have so much history. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6026.8s)]
*  Well, I wonder if it's also. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6028.9s)]
*  We're over in America. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6030.3s)]
*  A politeness. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6031.2s)]
*  We'll pour beer on the moment. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6032.1s)]
*  People over here. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6034.5s)]
*  Hey dude, quit fucking the moment. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6035.200000000001s)]
*  It's like, we're just people over here. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6037.1s)]
*  Just, you know, just being. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6038.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6042.3s)]
*  Just like the moments. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6042.8s)]
*  It's like there's millions of moments. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6045.700000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6047.700000000001s)]
*  There's so many moments that is, is kind of expansive. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6048.0s)]
*  And we've kind of had that in America. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6051.3s)]
*  We like, we've got unlimited moments, you know, but now I think we're [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6052.5s)]
*  starting, I think things are starting to change a little bit and it's like, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6055.700000000001s)]
*  man, we need to value this moment. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6058.3s)]
*  The economy of moments, basically it's like we are now in a moment [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6060.3s)]
*  where we don't have that many like live interactive experiences. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6064.3s)]
*  So I would think that people are starting to go when they go to [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6069.700000000001s)]
*  comedy shows or whatever, they're probably paying a little bit more. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6073.900000000001s)]
*  You know, they're like feel a bit more grateful to be there. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6077.700000000001s)]
*  Feel a bit more grateful to like have access to someone in real life [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6080.3s)]
*  after just spending a pandemic, not being able to see anyone, not [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6084.0s)]
*  being able to go out apart from in Tennessee, obviously. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6087.5s)]
*  But like the fact of that someone is stood in front of you and they've [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6092.7s)]
*  spent their whole life perfecting this art form and then you go there [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6096.6s)]
*  and then you just talk all over it. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6100.4s)]
*  I mean, the idea of doing that after the pandemic seemed seemed more [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6101.7s)]
*  insane than it did before because it would seem ungrateful. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6105.9s)]
*  Like especially with music. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6110.5s)]
*  I mean, you guys, the people are more likely to be able to party and [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6111.7s)]
*  stuff during your shows and have fun. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6114.3s)]
*  You know, with comedy are really people have to kind of sit [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6116.200000000001s)]
*  and listen for the most part. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6118.6s)]

*  Like girls, I would date and stuff. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6185.3s)]
*  I didn't want any girl to be like a reflection of me. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6186.7s)]
*  So it'd be like if they made a mistake or like I used to date this one [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6190.7s)]
*  girl who had no like beautiful, really sweet girl. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6195.2s)]
*  She had no sense of like spatial awareness. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6197.9s)]
*  She would just be like, you know, talking to you and like she bumping [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6200.7s)]
*  65 people somehow, like just while she was talking. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6203.7s)]
*  She's a dodgem. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6206.7s)]
*  She's a dodgem. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6207.9s)]
*  We call them dodgums. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6208.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6209.9s)]
*  And it's one of those, you know, like the cars that bump into each other [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6210.2s)]
*  in the fairground. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6215.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6215.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6215.9s)]
*  She was just a G like, oh my God, don't you know somebody's right behind you. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6216.2s)]
*  She would always turn and knock over a damn glass or a top hat off of somebody, [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6220.0s)]
*  you know, and it would just like it drove me. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6224.599999999999s)]
*  What would you do in that? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6228.4s)]
*  It just because I didn't want her to be a reflection of who I, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6229.8s)]
*  it would be like, I didn't want anybody thinking like, oh man, it's such a [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6233.2s)]
*  narcissistic thing. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6239.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6240.599999999999s)]
*  He, he endorses. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6240.9s)]
*  He's like, right. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6242.3s)]
*  Cool with this, right. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6243.7s)]
*  Which makes him also as as kind of on yield unwieldy and fucking, you know, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6245.0s)]
*  uncool or whatever. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6252.7s)]
*  Yeah, not cool in some way. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6253.7s)]
*  Ultimately it comes back to I'm not accepted or like, but you know, the I [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6255.099999999999s)]
*  thought I did exactly the same thing, but with with with like social interactions [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6260.3s)]
*  and like if somebody said the wrong thing, I'd prickle up and like feel really [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6266.1s)]
*  tense and like one and I probably it'll come out with a little comment towards [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6270.1s)]
*  them at some point, you know, later or even during the conversation and I just [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6273.8s)]
*  couldn't hide it. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6278.5s)]
*  I was so uncomfortable with somebody else fucking up because ultimately like [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6279.3s)]
*  the school I went to was just like people were so hard on each other. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6284.3s)]
*  If some if someone fucked up. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6288.5s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6290.1s)]
*  So you just develop this thing of like no one must say anything wrong. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6291.1s)]
*  No one can come into the situation with an energy that doesn't match everyone [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6295.3s)]
*  else. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6298.8s)]
*  No one can and it's like it's such a like, you know, restrictive place to live [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6299.4s)]
*  that and I just would emanate that. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6306.6s)]
*  Is that a very British thing you think or is that just it is? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6310.7s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6313.8s)]
*  Yeah, but I also just I think it's just the way I grew up. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6314.9s)]
*  I was in school. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6317.4s)]
*  I went to was like that. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6318.0s)]
*  It was a very the school I went to was like quite it was it was a school where [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6318.9s)]
*  you had to take a test to get in but it was free. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6323.0s)]
*  So so it wasn't like a private school, but it was for kids who excel and didn't [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6325.799999999999s)]
*  yeah, it's for kids who essentially came from all manners of background, but had [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6330.599999999999s)]
*  a certain level of reading comprehension or whatever it was like they tested you [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6336.5s)]
*  on multiple different things and so it was a good school to be at because it [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6341.599999999999s)]
*  had kind of like a culturally like there was a lot of different cultures, but it [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6346.7s)]
*  was very intellectual. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6351.2s)]
*  It was all about intellectual sparring and like when kids are like in some ways [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6353.0s)]
*  I'd have preferred to have been beaten up then psychologically bullied, you know, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6359.599999999999s)]
*  because at least then I could have had a chance to like hit someone right and [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6364.7s)]
*  get my anger out. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6367.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6369.2s)]
*  Maybe I'm not really sure what's worse, but when kids are like super manipulative [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6369.5s)]
*  and like a bit able to like find your button and like fully fucking fuck the [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6374.2s)]
*  button and then just keep and just keep fucking it until you're just like not [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6380.0s)]
*  able to defend yourself, you know, it's like that that is like a different [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6385.099999999999s)]
*  stuff and I think it puts you in this like psychological like defense for the [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6391.4s)]
*  rest of your life. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6397.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6397.7s)]
*  Unless you fix it. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6398.5s)]
*  I mean, I just took fucking ages to like get rid of that thing of like if someone [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6399.5s)]
*  says something or if I say the worst, honestly, the worst case scenario would be [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6404.299999999999s)]
*  I say something and then in my mind, like everyone just like turns around and [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6408.7s)]
*  just like. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6413.7s)]
*  What? [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6417.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6417.9s)]
*  What the fuck did you just say? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6418.4s)]
*  You know, everything stops. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6420.299999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like record. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6421.299999999999s)]
*  And I want to stop the music. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6423.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6425.299999999999s)]
*  And then. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6426.8s)]
*  Oh, and it's awkward. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6428.200000000001s)]
*  That was like my worst nightmare, basically, which is funny as it is a pretty [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6430.200000000001s)]
*  tame worst nightmare to have. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6435.3s)]
*  But but it's what happens in that environment. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6437.700000000001s)]
*  It's a psychological thriller. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6440.6s)]
*  Yeah, which you just shared, you know, yes, psychological thriller. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6442.5s)]
*  It's just not a yeah. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6445.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's definitely like I speaking of psychological thrillers. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6446.700000000001s)]
*  I got a clip. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6452.200000000001s)]
*  What you got, man? [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6453.200000000001s)]
*  A song broke out at a psych ward. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6454.6s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6457.7s)]
*  They all broke out singing songs. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6458.8s)]
*  This is it now insurance barely probably even cover this. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6460.7s)]
*  They got my vote. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6484.0s)]
*  What party are they running with? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6497.0s)]
*  This is unlike this. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6498.8s)]
*  Like living in my house. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6500.0s)]
*  I mean, I live with three people. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6500.9s)]
*  So this is basically our house. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6502.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6504.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6512.2s)]
*  And we just, yeah. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6513.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6514.8s)]
*  It's a very, it's kind of a modern, modern thing. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6515.3s)]
*  I wonder, it's interesting how stuff like, I wonder if we're getting to this place in the world where it's like, I don't know what I'm trying to say. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6518.9s)]
*  It's like we like everything feels very vigilante now. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6529.3s)]
*  It's like the person who's going to like, it's like the world feels kind of like the wild west. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6534.4s)]
*  You mean like individualistic? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6540.3s)]
*  Like people are just kind of just doing, they've kind of gone, fuck it. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6541.5s)]
*  I've given up on society. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6546.1s)]
*  I'm just going to do it my own way. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6547.4s)]
*  This is the fabric of American society. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6549.7s)]
*  I feel like quickly unraveled. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6551.9s)]
*  Like Betsy Ross is like the stitching somehow over the past five years has come out. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6553.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6558.9s)]
*  And I don't know if a lot of people are buying into the this American ideal anymore. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6559.3s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6563.8s)]
*  I don't know if they're not. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6564.3s)]
*  I just don't know. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6565.5s)]
*  I'm this is also like in Los Angeles right now. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6566.6s)]
*  You don't get a really clear idea. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6569.4s)]
*  I mean, Los Angeles is a very, very unclear picture of or at least Hollywood. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6570.8s)]
*  Yeah, Hollywood. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6578.400000000001s)]
*  That's an extremely unclear picture of like people's interaction in general [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6579.1s)]
*  because if so much of it is incentivized by success or power or fame or in some way [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6584.1s)]
*  somebody's like desire or drive to to like to achieve something then obviously things [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6593.900000000001s)]
*  just they're not they're not as they they're not as pure as just they're not pure basically. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6603.1s)]
*  Whereas I think most places are not like that. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6608.7s)]
*  I mean and also, you know, that is just speaking for an industry rather than like Los Angeles [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6610.8s)]

*  A lot of times I'll say Los Angeles instead of really I just mean Hollywood. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6623.8s)]
*  Are there are is there like other genres and stuff that you see where you would see yourself [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6628.599999999999s)]
*  going into music? [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6632.9s)]
*  Is there anything that feels off-limits? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6633.7s)]
*  Do you feel like you're kind of have your horizons of even possibility brought broadened [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6635.3s)]
*  over time or over the years or anything or do you? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6640.7s)]

*  So scoring a film? [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6650.8s)]
*  Yeah scoring a kind of visual thing. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6652.0s)]
*  I call it a film, but it's not a kind of movie in the way that like a it's not a you know, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6655.9s)]
*  the master or something or like a fucking narrative driven movie is it's a kind of a [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6664.6s)]
*  more of a visual thing. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6669.4s)]
*  But I'm really excited about it and I hope that it leads to more of that and I want to [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6672.1s)]
*  do narrative movies is like proper, you know, that kind of thing. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6678.3s)]
*  Um, weird that my music is seen as so atmospheric, but that I've not really ever been involved [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6682.1s)]
*  in kind of scoring and stuff, but I have wanted to for a while and um. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6690.9s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like yeah, your music does feel like that. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6698.3s)]
*  I feel like I'm hitchhiking through my own feelings kind of sometimes a little bit. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6700.8s)]

*  I'll have to listen more. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6718.7s)]
*  I think it just kind of depends on whatever feeling I'm in at that moment. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6719.599999999999s)]
*  What are the feelings that you kind of like when you listen to music like what when do [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6723.0s)]

*  Yeah, there's a couple of songs I'll listen to. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6732.799999999999s)]
*  I think when I want to feel something I'll listen to some other stuff. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6735.799999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6739.1s)]
*  You know. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6739.8s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6741.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6742.3s)]
*  Because yeah, because music is I guess the thing the thing is with our jobs is that they [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6743.400000000001s)]
*  they become they become jobs. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6749.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, totally people like what are your hobbies? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6752.900000000001s)]

*  My hobbies became my job. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6755.700000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6757.1s)]
*  And now and now it's neither. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6757.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6759.900000000001s)]
*  And it's so now I have to find out things outside. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6760.700000000001s)]
*  So outside of music and comedy, what do you like do you as someone who you I mean, I feel [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6764.1s)]
*  like we're so similar in the so many ways when you look at the world of people going [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6772.8s)]
*  and experiencing things like, you know, someone's skydiving and somebody's going surfing. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6779.2s)]
*  Like do you ever go past the sea and watch people surfing go? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6783.4s)]
*  God, I wish I could just like be in the world like that the way they are. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6786.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6792.0s)]
*  I think that all the time. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6792.8s)]
*  It's hard for it's for there's something about it. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6794.3s)]
*  That's tough for me. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6796.1s)]
*  I think sometimes I do comedy. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6797.2s)]
*  I want to be the person in the crowd having a good time. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6799.2s)]
*  I want to be the one laughing. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6801.6s)]
*  You like when when Ye said, for me knows Kanye West said, I the my my greatest regret is [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6802.7s)]
*  that I was never able to see myself perform live. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6814.3s)]
*  That seems seems like an egotistical thing to say, but I think in in some ways it articulates [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6817.400000000001s)]
*  something that a lot of performers feel not necessarily present at their own shows. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6824.0s)]
*  And actually they want to be more part of the feeling that everyone else is having than [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6833.3s)]
*  they are of the feeling they're having. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6838.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think forever. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6840.200000000001s)]
*  I never went to any comedy or listen to much at all. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6841.0s)]
*  You know, I think I didn't want to be influenced. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6843.200000000001s)]
*  And I think I was just so stuck in my own little world. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6845.4s)]
*  I didn't want anything to mess up my world or anything to influence it. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6848.7s)]
*  You know, I just valued my own little creative space so much really almost too much. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6852.9s)]
*  It kept me isolated. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6857.4s)]
*  But yeah, I didn't I didn't want to have any real influences outside of myself. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6858.4s)]
*  And sometimes I thought, yeah, I wish I could be the person laughing at the show. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6865.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't be at least I'll be as the closest I can to that person will be. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6870.0s)]
*  Someone at least making the humor. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6875.7s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6877.5s)]
*  It's like at least then I'm part of the equation. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6878.2s)]
*  That's how I felt about music. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6880.0s)]
*  So I felt about DJing as well because like I always felt really self-conscious about [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6881.2s)]
*  dancing and like expressing myself in those ways. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6886.5s)]
*  And also I'm very tall. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6889.9s)]
*  I'm very, you know, I mean, I wouldn't say I'm out of proportion, but I [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6892.299999999999s)]
*  long fellow, but I'm a long person and I and I my limbs. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6896.4s)]
*  You get shot first in Army. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6900.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6901.7s)]
*  I'd be, you know, what's that movie where they they they wire comes across the [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6902.6s)]
*  ship and all the people who are taller than a certain height get immediately [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6907.7s)]
*  killed or go ship. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6910.5s)]
*  I'd be gone in the first scene. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6914.400000000001s)]
*  And then also I'm, you know, like a we call them daddy long legs, but they're [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6916.3s)]
*  like mayflies or whatever those those insects that have like those really [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6921.0s)]
*  long legs and they just sort of like bumble around like not knocking into [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6924.8s)]
*  stuff. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6928.900000000001s)]
*  That's me. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6929.1s)]
*  I like a rave or you know something. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6930.6s)]
*  So I just I like I'm I'm I always feel slightly uncomfortable. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6932.6s)]
*  I never I'm always knocking into people like oh shit. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6936.3s)]
*  And then, you know back to you know losing myself. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6940.0s)]
*  Can never quite lose myself in the moment. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6944.5s)]
*  Yeah, I can never lose myself completely man. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6946.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6949.0s)]
*  I find that son. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6949.400000000001s)]
*  So I I find that DJing is like an amazing way of like not having to just [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6950.1s)]
*  not having to contend with any of that stuff and instead I can just stand [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6957.3s)]
*  there and be worshiped like a God. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6960.1s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6963.1s)]
*  I can be just present the music that everyone just gets, you know, gets [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6963.7s)]
*  to do that too. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6969.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6970.400000000001s)]
*  And then I'm then at least my excuse can be that well, I can't be down [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6971.0s)]

*  saying something dumb to someone or like not, you know, not having a cool [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6991.0s)]
*  social interaction. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=6996.6s)]

*  It's honestly. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7031.3s)]
*  Yeah, it feels exorbitant. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7035.0s)]
*  Have you been to festivals and stuff where it's just like DJ festivals and stuff? [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7036.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7039.5s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7040.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7040.599999999999s)]
*  So sometimes do you just DJ and sometimes you play your music? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7041.400000000001s)]
*  I DJ, I actually love DJing. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7045.3s)]
*  It's like, for me, I mean, it's such a craft to it and it's so deep. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7047.0s)]
*  Like it's great. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7052.8s)]
*  A great DJ is like, you know, controlling the vibe of the entire [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7053.900000000001s)]
*  place and like can be in tune with, genuinely in tune with the crowd. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7058.400000000001s)]
*  And like, it's a, it's a real, you know, you can go into a set not knowing [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7062.1s)]
*  at all what you're going to play and just, and just watch the crowd and [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7068.3s)]
*  figure out how you're going to like, you're, you're coming on after the [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7071.900000000001s)]
*  next, the DJ before you and you're watching how they're playing to the [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7077.0s)]
*  crowd and you're seeing what works. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7080.3s)]
*  And then you're going, okay, what's in my record bag that I can, you're [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7082.3s)]
*  back in the day I play vinyl. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7085.3s)]
*  And so I'd be, you know, just kind of acting on it's real in the moment [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7087.2s)]
*  decisions, like this tune is in the right key or it's in the right tempo. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7094.1s)]
*  It was in the right, it's the right vibe to come on to, to follow on from [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7099.5s)]
*  the last thing and like, oh, this one will get them like this one will [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7103.400000000001s)]
*  get them dancing or this one. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7108.400000000001s)]
*  So that feeling is like, you, you're kind of living through them vicariously. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7109.700000000001s)]
*  You're like experiencing that hype and that fun with them and through them. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7115.200000000001s)]
*  And then you can kind of like, kind of pretend you're at your own show at [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7120.8s)]
*  the same time and it's. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7123.8s)]
*  It's like psychological and it's, it's also, you're getting to hear all your [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7128.7s)]
*  favorite music and like, it's just, it's brilliant. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7137.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7141.0s)]
*  My friend, Satchfield is a DJ down in New Orleans and he's one of my [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7141.2s)]
*  best friends from growing up and I get to watch him like, you know, how he [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7143.7s)]
*  looks at a group of people and like, you know, you can see the wheels start [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7147.0s)]
*  turning in his head and like. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7151.3s)]
*  And he knows so much music here. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7153.4s)]
*  You just start to think like you start to see him grin and kind of like, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7155.4s)]
*  all right, what's going to happen. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7159.4s)]
*  The cogs are turning. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7160.4s)]

*  This is pretty American story. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7170.299999999999s)]
*  Philadelphia man just ate a rotisserie chicken every day for 40 days. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7172.099999999999s)]

*  He doesn't recommend it. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7178.099999999999s)]
*  He's on the, the, the Jordan Peterson diet. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7179.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7184.1s)]
*  Oh, I went to dinner with Jordan Peterson, man. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7184.6s)]
*  And during the pandemic with him and his daughter and her boyfriend and [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7186.5s)]
*  they ordered all meat, all meat and brother at the end of the meal, there's [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7192.1s)]
*  literally a plate of bones in the middle of the table, it very much had [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7197.1s)]
*  like this game of Thrones type of vibe. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7201.0s)]
*  And no, no asparagus, no vegetables. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7203.200000000001s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7205.6s)]
*  Mead, I think somebody had sparkling water and they even frowned at him [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7206.8s)]
*  a little, whoever it was. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7209.8s)]
*  Other people had flat water with somebody bubbled up and everybody was [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7211.7s)]
*  like, you whore. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7214.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7215.3s)]
*  That just went. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7216.1s)]
*  But in the end, it looked like a plate, like a batch of looking [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7217.2s)]
*  like a batch of dogs had been there. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7220.2s)]
*  Just a plate. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7221.900000000001s)]
*  I'll have to put some pictures in. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7222.5s)]
*  I have that. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7223.8s)]
*  I, uh, I've never done 40 days of eating whole chickens, but I've, um, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7224.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm vegetarian, so it's not something. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7233.9s)]
*  Oh, you are vegetarian. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7236.4s)]
*  It's not a sport. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7237.4s)]
*  I can really. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7238.099999999999s)]
*  But he didn't really have a reason, which is my criticism. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7239.799999999999s)]
*  He just said he's doing it to bring people together. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7242.9s)]
*  So I don't, I mean, judging by that picture, it did bring a lot of people [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7245.0s)]
*  together. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7249.799999999999s)]
*  I wonder what it looks like. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7250.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7252.4s)]
*  The last supper at like an Albertsons. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7252.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7254.599999999999s)]
*  He's like the high priest of chicken eating. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7254.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7258.5s)]
*  It has a very renaissance. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7258.799999999999s)]
*  This looks like a lot of like a pre like a pre-party for a renaissance [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7260.0s)]
*  fair. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7263.7s)]
*  I feel like it looks like a, it looks like a paint a resident painting. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7265.3s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7268.6s)]
*  Huh? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7269.5s)]
*  It actually would be really cool if somebody made like a nice painting of [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7269.9s)]
*  that, you know, the three you can challenge. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7272.7s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of great bits of art in here. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7275.4s)]
*  I think you should challenge your listeners to, to paint this because [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7277.8s)]
*  it's a, it's a wonderful scene. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7281.6s)]
*  Oh, that's remarkable. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7283.9s)]
*  Actually the 40th day of rotisserie chicken. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7284.7s)]
*  I wonder how many of those, I wonder if that crowd grew. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7287.1s)]
*  Over the 40 days to this. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7290.0s)]
*  I imagine it didn't start this way. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7292.5s)]
*  His girlfriend probably left him. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7294.8s)]
*  I'm sure after day eight or something of her being lonely. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7296.1s)]
*  Well, I imagine the smell probably got got quite overwhelming. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7298.9s)]
*  And there he is. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7303.7s)]
*  And it seems very perverse. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7304.3s)]
*  I think there's something. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7305.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's something edible or something going on. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7310.3s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7314.2s)]
*  I could, I don't even really know what that means, but did you ever work [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7315.8s)]
*  at a food place, James? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7319.3s)]
*  I never worked at a food place. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7321.6s)]
*  No. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7323.1s)]
*  Did you have a job? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7323.6s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7324.2s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7324.6s)]
*  I did one time do a job at a festival where I was part of catering [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7324.900000000001s)]
*  stuff and they gave us a one baked potato for lunch for lunch and dinner. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7330.5s)]
*  That was what we had. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7337.900000000001s)]
*  It was a one baked. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7338.7s)]
*  Which I thought was unreasonable to say the least. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7340.3s)]
*  I mean, it was a, they weren't, they didn't give you any butter or anything. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7344.7s)]
*  It was just you, you queued up for a baked potato and that was [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7347.7s)]
*  your sustenance for the day. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7351.0s)]
*  Every British story I feel like has like some mild starvation somewhere in. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7352.400000000001s)]
*  And I feel like there's like such a. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7356.2s)]
*  Some self punishment or like some kind of. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7357.8s)]
*  There's such bad launching. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7360.1s)]
*  It was like four. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7361.6s)]
*  I've used in the four Yorkshireman sketch. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7362.400000000001s)]
*  I'll have to play that to you. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7365.0s)]
*  Basically. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7365.900000000001s)]
*  It's a bunch of people sitting around being like, you know, where are we? [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7366.400000000001s)]
*  I, when we grew up, we didn't have a pot to piss in. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7372.0s)]
*  You know, we didn't blah, blah, blah. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7374.2s)]
*  And then the other guy's like, yeah, well, I mean, we didn't even have a house. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7375.7s)]
*  We lived in a ditch, blah, blah, blah. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7379.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7380.6s)]
*  And when our dad came home, he beat us around the head. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7381.2s)]
*  And it was like, oh, you were lucky. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7383.400000000001s)]
*  The other guy's like, you were lucky. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7385.2s)]
*  We had a, you know, our dad would come home and stab us and we'd live in a pond. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7386.3s)]
*  You know, anyway, so that's, that's like, but it's like a classic. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7392.6s)]
*  I mean, I really miss. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7397.400000000001s)]
*  No, it's look, but it's, but it's a, it's a classic English sketch. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7398.6s)]
*  And that's kind of what the, the baked potato thing sort of like conjures. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7401.4s)]
*  Really is this like stock, uh, just, you know, scarcity mentality situation where, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7405.599999999999s)]
*  but, but, but, but then it's at a festival where everyone's having loads of fun. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7416.4s)]
*  Um, yeah, everybody's all geeked up on, uh, Molly eating baked potatoes. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7420.299999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, they were all eating, you know, from food trucks and like, so [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7424.799999999999s)]
*  we were just, but anyway, so I, I worked there and, and, um, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7428.2s)]
*  but that was only for two days. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7431.799999999999s)]
*  And then I got fired, I think, cause I just wasn't, I wasn't, I just, I [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7432.9s)]
*  felt away about the potatoes. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7437.9s)]
*  I just felt like it wasn't enough. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7440.5s)]
*  And I'm obviously very tall. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7443.9s)]
*  I was always, I was always tall. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7445.0s)]
*  I was tall then. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7446.0s)]
*  Oh, so, um, it's hard being that tall guy. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7447.0s)]
*  I feel like the, I remember the one kid that would come back from summer [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7451.2s)]
*  tall and everybody like, what in the look with this mother. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7453.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7456.7s)]
*  People would be like, Oh, look at this show off. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7457.0s)]
*  That was me. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7459.099999999999s)]
*  What does he think he's doing? [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7460.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, look at this guy with his pussy ass little cervical spine. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7461.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7465.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7465.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7465.8s)]
*  You know, and they start saying all that kind of shit. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7466.099999999999s)]
*  They did say that kind of shit. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7468.3s)]
*  And I just, I just took it and then I learned to love my height over time, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7469.8s)]
*  but it started, yeah, I hated being tall. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7475.099999999999s)]
*  Really hated it. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7479.0s)]
*  Oh, I think it would be such an adventure, but it would be very interesting. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7479.8s)]
*  When you put your arm out of the bed and it just touches the floor, it pets [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7485.0s)]
*  the cat if it's down there. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7488.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7489.400000000001s)]
*  What about hitting your head on stuff? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7490.0s)]
*  Oh, and then you hate your fucking head. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7491.8s)]
*  I hate, I did that a number of times. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7494.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it probably accounts for some of my personality. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7496.8s)]
*  Now, what about love? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7500.400000000001s)]
*  A lot of your song, there's definitely a lot of loss, a lot of like Jesus, huh? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7501.6s)]
*  Some girl, some girl, some girl left this guy at the day old bread store. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7505.6s)]
*  You know? [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7510.900000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7511.3s)]
*  Um, where does some of that come from? [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7511.900000000001s)]
*  Like, where does it, where do you think some of that comes from? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7513.8s)]
*  Well, my first record, I'd never been in love and, or if I had, it would be [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7516.6s)]
*  unrequited, so I was, I lost my virginity very late, I was a very late bloomer. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7524.5s)]
*  And, uh, so I was just like 20 years old. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7530.7s)]
*  20, 22, 23. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7535.3s)]
*  Pretty late. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7538.8s)]
*  I mean, in this country, that's probably not as uncommon because maybe [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7539.4s)]
*  because of religious reasons. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7543.0s)]
*  Um, but the exchange rate and virginity is really, I think it's probably about [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7545.2s)]
*  one to one, 0.6 to one when it comes to like British to American. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7550.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7557.3s)]
*  Um, so like what the dollar to the pound used to be. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7558.1s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7562.2s)]
*  Um, and I just didn't, I was always very ashamed of that at the time. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7563.8s)]
*  That you hadn't lost it yet? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7572.6s)]
*  But I hadn't, yeah. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7573.8s)]
*  And I, and I was also wasn't like, I wasn't in the game. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7574.6s)]
*  Oh, so you were really on the sidelines. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7579.0s)]
*  I was really on the sidelines. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7580.7s)]
*  Just kind of being like, people will be talking about sex and I'd be like, yeah. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7581.8s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7585.8s)]
*  I mean, totally like vagina. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7587.400000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7592.1s)]
*  Like it's man, you'd be wearing like a man city Jersey, just talking about it. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7592.400000000001s)]
*  Like this. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7596.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7597.1s)]
*  For sure. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7597.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7598.2s)]
*  Fuck like, of course. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7598.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7600.1s)]
*  Sex always. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7600.5s)]
*  I know what you're talking about. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7601.2s)]
*  Um, wow. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7603.0s)]
*  So you were really on the sidelines just of like, kind of like a lot of social [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7603.5s)]
*  stuff kind of, or yeah, I think so. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7606.900000000001s)]
*  I was the thing. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7608.8s)]
*  I was just a, I was an outsider in a lot of ways and, uh, cause that gives you a [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7609.3s)]
*  lot of time to observe stuff and see it. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7614.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7616.3s)]
*  But I was also like, I was kind of semi-popular in other ways. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7616.5s)]
*  Like I was, I was always like a bit of a, I was always a bit of a class clown. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7619.5s)]
*  And I was, I got in trouble a lot and I was always very kind of insolent and [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7625.0s)]
*  like not, I don't know if I was acting out because I thought it was cool or [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7631.0s)]
*  cause I thought it was, I genuinely had a lot of like, uh, like I was, um, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7635.099999999999s)]
*  anti-establishment in general. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7641.299999999999s)]
*  Like I just felt, I just felt, I felt like I wasn't supposed to be at school as well. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7643.299999999999s)]
*  I always felt like I was supposed to be, you know, um, in music somewhere [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7649.2s)]
*  doing something else. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7656.099999999999s)]
*  Or doing something else. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7656.9s)]
*  Just, I just knew that I wasn't supposed to. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7657.799999999999s)]
*  I knew I didn't need science. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7659.7s)]
*  School probably always felt very novice to you. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7661.099999999999s)]
*  I knew I didn't need to learn French. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7663.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7665.0s)]
*  It probably felt novice to you. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7665.4s)]
*  Um, in a, in a strange way. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7667.5s)]
*  It didn't feel, it didn't feel like beneath me or it didn't feel, it didn't feel like [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7669.2s)]
*  I didn't feel like I was too smart for it. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7673.5s)]
*  Or I didn't feel like I was just for, I just thought I don't need these skills. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7675.3s)]
*  I don't, cause I know where I'm going and I don't need any of this stuff. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7680.099999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7682.8s)]

*  And also there was this thing, I can't remember what it's got. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7692.700000000001s)]
*  Alpha personality was basically where you have this thing where you're like in [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7695.0s)]
*  the future, I'm going to get everything I always wanted. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7700.200000000001s)]
*  So it's okay that I'm suffering now, you know, so there's this delusional kind [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7702.8s)]
*  of thing of like, I've got my eyes on the prize and so you can all like, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7707.3s)]

*  Oh no, I did, I did Jameela's, but I could, you know, I mean, [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7737.3s)]
*  Yeah, you have to. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7740.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, what are you going to not? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7742.099999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to do Jameela's podcast. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7743.099999999999s)]
*  I would. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7744.7s)]
*  I thought I had a chance with her, Danny. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7745.1s)]
*  I didn't even know I was dropping her off at your house. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7746.3s)]
*  You thought it was a long career in podcasting with her ahead of you. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7748.3s)]
*  Um, what, uh, what else do we have? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7753.900000000001s)]
*  What else is in the news? [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7757.3s)]
*  Oh wait. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7758.900000000001s)]
*  So did you first time you fell in love then? [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7759.3s)]
*  So what was that like? [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7761.1s)]
*  It was really amazing. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7763.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, I did wait, I waited and it wasn't, I didn't do it in a kind of, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7765.1s)]
*  um, like a religious sense, but I think there was a spiritual component to it. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7769.1s)]
*  I think I was waiting for someone I trusted. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7773.3s)]
*  I think I was waiting for someone I had a spiritual connection with. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7774.900000000001s)]
*  Um, but actually in the end I lost, lost my virginity to someone [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7777.5s)]
*  random, someone kind of random or I had no connection with at all. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7783.1s)]
*  Um, but the relationship I ended up in was one that was great. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7787.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7793.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7793.5s)]
*  Someone, someone really wonderful. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7793.900000000001s)]
*  And, and, um, and then I only had one more relationship after that. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7795.1s)]
*  And then I was like, I'm going to go back and do this. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7800.3s)]
*  I'm going to have one more relationship after that. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7802.3s)]
*  And that's the one I'm in. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7803.5s)]
*  Um, so that brings us up to now, but, um, [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7804.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7806.7s)]
*  And you guys have been in love for a long time. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7806.900000000001s)]
*  Eight years. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7809.7s)]
*  Wow. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7810.5s)]
*  It's about eight years. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7811.7s)]
*  Um, that's cool. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7813.5s)]
*  That's rare. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7816.1s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7817.1s)]
*  Um, she's incredible. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7818.7s)]
*  And you know, it, I guess it does feel like we've, it just always feels like [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7819.900000000001s)]
*  we've been together a year, which is kind of amazing. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7827.1s)]
*  That's kind of a cool lyric or something like that. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7830.5s)]
*  You know? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7832.3s)]
*  Uh, yeah, it is. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7833.1s)]
*  Although, you know, people are, people are strange about listening to love [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7835.1s)]
*  songs about someone you're actually with. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7841.7s)]
*  I don't know why that is. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7843.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7845.7s)]
*  If that's the case, it almost becomes a little bit. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7846.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7851.1s)]
*  Does it take on more of a country music vibe then sometime a little bit? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7851.3s)]
*  I should get, become a country artist and then people would accept. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7854.900000000001s)]
*  That it's a little of songs you're actually with. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7859.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7860.7s)]
*  Cause there's something about your songs. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7860.9s)]
*  I want you to not be with the person. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7862.5s)]
*  You want me to be completely fucking heartbroken. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7865.099999999999s)]
*  I want the person to be as lonely as I probably am feeling or it's like, you [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7868.3s)]
*  know, you want there to be some of that. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7873.9s)]
*  And look, James's music is an all lonely music. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7875.5s)]
*  If you haven't heard it, it's all, it's all types of stuff, but it's a nice way [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7877.599999999999s)]
*  to want, I find it to, it's, it's, it's changes a lot, but it's, it's, um, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7880.9s)]
*  there's all different. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7886.0s)]
*  There's all, yes. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7886.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7887.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7887.7s)]
*  But I did become known for like a very, you know, a period in my life where I [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7887.9s)]
*  wrote a lot of the music that I became known for was a time of immense sadness [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7896.099999999999s)]
*  and loneliness for me. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7900.9s)]
*  So, I mean, I guess it came out sounding a little bit full on and a little bit [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7901.599999999999s)]
*  that, but also at the same time, it's uplifting music at the same time. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7907.099999999999s)]
*  Cause it's like, it's a bit like, um, a bit like with Radiohead, for example, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7909.9s)]
*  there's a, there's certain bands who through time have, have got the [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7915.1s)]
*  criticism of sad or as if that's criticism, I don't know why, but, you [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7918.900000000001s)]
*  know, sad or doubt or depressing or whatever. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7925.700000000001s)]
*  And I think that's just a reflection of whoever is listening most of the time. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7928.8s)]
*  I mean, something can sound dreary and on some day be dreary and on another [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7933.700000000001s)]
*  day be completely uplifting. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7938.6s)]
*  It just depends what your mood is and how it's, and also I would never [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7939.700000000001s)]
*  want to like, I'd never want to discourage and I hate language that [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7944.6s)]
*  discourages people from listening to music that gives them emotional release. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7949.200000000001s)]
*  Like that's why I had such a problem with the sad boy time. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7954.200000000001s)]
*  And like when I would, I'd get written about in, in like publications, like, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7957.8s)]
*  you know, certain publications basically who would, who'd write, you know, like [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7963.1s)]
*  one of the things was like, he needs to, maybe she'd get out more or like, I'm [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7968.5s)]
*  just like, you don't get it. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7972.6s)]
*  Like you don't get that there are people who feel the same thing that I feel, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7975.0s)]
*  who are listening to this processing stuff. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7979.200000000001s)]
*  And by this language, what you're saying is like, don't do that. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7983.0s)]
*  And you might be, you might actually be taking away someone's emotional comfort [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7988.6s)]
*  blanket that makes their life way harder. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7993.400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's funny. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7998.0s)]
*  I think that's an honest too about like someone's on this podcast. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=7998.6s)]
*  I'll talk about feelings and things that I've had over the years. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8000.9s)]
*  And sometimes I feel like it gets, it's tough cause I have to, I have to walk [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8003.299999999999s)]
*  this line. I don't want to get too melancholy. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8007.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8009.4s)]
*  I don't want to get, actually, I don't care if I get melancholy, but I don't [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8009.7s)]
*  want to get where I am in self-pity. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8013.599999999999s)]
*  Like self-indulgent. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8016.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8017.5s)]
*  And it can happen. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8017.9s)]
*  It's really tough. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8019.299999999999s)]
*  It's tough cause you don't notice it happening. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8020.299999999999s)]
*  You think you're just exploring it more. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8022.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8023.9s)]
*  And, and it can, and it can certainly, it can certainly happen. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8024.599999999999s)]
*  I think with, with music though, it's interesting because it's like music [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8028.5s)]
*  and musicians, they let us feel something that we can't say. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8032.9s)]
*  It's like, man, this you'll see somebody who won't even talk probably [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8037.2s)]
*  to their wife or something, but then they'll, they'll both get there [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8041.0s)]
*  and sing a song together or dance to a, it's like, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8044.5s)]
*  or that video of everyone singing. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8048.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8051.4s)]
*  To people trap in the mental hospital singing Katy Perry, you know, or [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8051.6s)]
*  whatever. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8054.8s)]
*  I want it that way. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8055.1s)]

*  like the parent, our parents generation would just be like, no, don't [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8061.9s)]
*  talk about it. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8064.6s)]

*  but other than that, just get on with it. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8082.0s)]

*  And even the British are cracking out. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8088.3s)]
*  Patty Pimlet had a fricking outspoken speech. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8090.200000000001s)]
*  Remember a couple of fights ago. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8092.5s)]
*  What was that? [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8094.200000000001s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8094.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8095.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8096.3s)]
*  You know, it's like, you know, it's like, yeah, I think we're also like, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8096.8s)]
*  there's just an inner human humanity is this energy of nature. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8105.5s)]
*  It's this path of nature. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8109.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8110.6s)]
*  We don't really know what it is yet. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8111.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8112.6s)]
*  And I think we've, you know, when you look at how much feeling and [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8113.599999999999s)]
*  stuff is in there at a certain point, it's gotta come out. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8119.599999999999s)]
*  It is. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8122.4s)]
*  It has. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8122.799999999999s)]
*  And then, but then I think what you're touching on is quite interesting [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8123.299999999999s)]
*  because it's like, we're not, there is a certain point at which it's not [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8125.5s)]
*  productive anymore and you know, I think that coming to an, a balance between [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8130.0s)]
*  our generation, maybe on the generation before us or, or couple before us, a [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8137.099999999999s)]
*  balance between those two mentalities of like, you know, maybe self victimization [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8141.3s)]
*  on our account or kind of going over the same things over and over again and [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8147.3s)]
*  not realizing you're in a cycle or a pattern or just kind of like focusing [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8153.2s)]
*  so much on the trauma that you're not actually kind of paying attention to [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8159.2s)]
*  like actual real life practices that can help you or like forward motion, [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8163.6s)]
*  forward momentum, like the fact that achievement actually genuinely does, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8168.6s)]
*  you know, can be a good motivation or, you know, like general kind of, yeah, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8173.3s)]
*  like positive thinking, like lots of, you know, it's like, you can just dwell [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8181.1s)]
*  on things and we have a, you know, there is a school of thought that says [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8186.700000000001s)]
*  being in constant kind of term, kind of digging up of things is like important. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8194.0s)]
*  I think there's a balance to be struck. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8202.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8204.2s)]
*  And the kind of wisdom in the older generations sometimes is that, that [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8204.6s)]
*  we, there is a lot of common common commonality to be found between people [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8213.1s)]
*  and that our differences sometimes are not always worth dwelling on and that [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8220.0s)]
*  we are, we are strong capable people who can fucking get it done. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8226.1s)]
*  Get it done. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8235.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8236.3s)]
*  Get persevere, take care of ourselves. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8236.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8238.8s)]
*  Sometimes we have to come to our own rescue. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8239.1s)]
*  You start to realize that too. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8240.6s)]
*  It's like the self help stuff. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8242.4s)]
*  It starts to create sometimes too much of a world where you're always [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8244.0s)]
*  trying to help yourself. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8246.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8247.6s)]
*  And you're reading up and taking in so much stuff about, you know, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8247.8s)]
*  inspirational, but you're not action. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8252.599999999999s)]
*  And also that's an industry. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8255.4s)]
*  That's a people are profiting off of your, your, your constant engagement [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8256.5s)]
*  with self help, your constant engagement. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8260.699999999999s)]
*  So I got a certain point. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8262.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, are you okay? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8263.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8265.3s)]
*  If you're not, you know, I think that I always encourage being aware of your [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8265.5s)]
*  emotions and trying to delve into them and like figure them out. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8271.4s)]
*  Um, but I think there is a, there is a certain point where it's time to [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8275.400000000001s)]
*  rejoin the world and try and float. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8282.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8286.7s)]
*  I mean, you, yeah, I find you will, if you sit there in that feeling long [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8287.0s)]
*  enough, looking around inside of it and looking at the reading, the graffiti [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8290.300000000001s)]
*  and shit, you will then that's where you're going to live. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8293.400000000001s)]
*  You know, I start to realize it's like, you know, they always say you [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8296.300000000001s)]
*  can act your way in a positive thinking, but you can't think your way [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8299.2s)]
*  in a positive action, you know? [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8302.6s)]
*  And that's something I have to come back to because I like to dwell. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8304.5s)]
*  I like to wander around in the, in the, um, in the art museum of my childhood [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8306.8s)]
*  and of my like things that meant something to me and like my first kiss [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8312.6s)]
*  and the first like mistakes I made. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8318.0s)]
*  And like, I like to wander around and look at all the artifacts and things, [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8321.2s)]
*  but you can't live in the museum. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8324.7s)]
*  You can't. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8326.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8326.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8326.8s)]
*  And there's a time to shut it off and leave the museum. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8327.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8329.4s)]
*  There's a, um, I can't remember, but I think it was my government just [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8329.8s)]
*  talking about like, you know, being in this hole and just like painting [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8332.7s)]
*  the walls and it's just now it's just a beautiful hole. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8337.0s)]
*  It's like, which now sounds, but no, it's the semi-sexual in a way [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8339.5s)]
*  that I didn't want it to, but that's, you know, that is to some extent. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8344.1s)]
*  It like sums up where you can get to where you can draw the map perfectly [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8349.800000000001s)]
*  of how your emotions have your emotional state. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8357.800000000001s)]
*  You can become so obsessed with like understanding your emotional state [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8361.2s)]
*  that actually you've kind of taken focus of actual forward momentum and living. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8366.5s)]
*  Um, and so, and I think, yeah, it is. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8370.4s)]
*  And I think a lot of people who are in that place, they, they, you know, [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8373.5s)]
*  a lot of people who you, have you noticed this when someone's just [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8377.4s)]
*  for the first time discovering like shit that they've done wrong or the things [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8381.7s)]
*  that they like not happy about with themselves, they're just constantly [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8385.9s)]
*  talking about it. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8389.800000000001s)]
*  And they want to talk about it to everyone and every, you know, and, and [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8391.199999999999s)]
*  they're going into such detail and you're just like, but that's someone [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8394.5s)]
*  who is at the start. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8399.1s)]
*  They just got there. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8401.6s)]
*  They just started. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8402.699999999999s)]
*  That's always the way. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8404.0s)]
*  Um, and yeah, I eventually, I wanted to get to a place where I just [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8405.9s)]
*  didn't have to talk about it. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8409.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8411.0s)]
*  You know, and I could just talk about other shit. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8411.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8414.0s)]
*  Or at least look back on it with a sense of power and not be standing in it as much. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8414.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8418.6s)]
*  Cause I did all that. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8418.8s)]
*  I've gone through all of those phases. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8419.8s)]
*  This is not coming from a judgmental place. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8421.599999999999s)]
*  This is saying to like, this is saying like, you have to kind of like [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8423.199999999999s)]
*  become that like evangelizing kind of just to, just to, you know, you [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8427.099999999999s)]
*  got to destabilize first. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8432.5s)]
*  I think that's why it's so hard sometimes to imagine looking inwards. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8434.099999999999s)]
*  Cause initially you're going to have to go through a period of [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8439.5s)]
*  complete destabilization. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8441.5s)]
*  And that's why a lot of people never do it. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8443.599999999999s)]
*  Um, which I think it's amazing that you have, uh, cause and, and been public [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8445.3s)]
*  about it and talked about on your podcast and a lot of people have [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8451.4s)]
*  probably done it through you and with you. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8453.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8455.9s)]
*  I think, you know, we just try and we will, we wonder sometimes what is our instrument? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8456.1s)]
*  Why does God have us here? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8459.8s)]
*  The, you know, to share whatever, you know, it's like, you don't even know. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8461.2s)]
*  It's like, what is the little piece of the universe that's supposed to fly out of you? [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8464.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8469.2s)]
*  So do you, do you, out of side of, um, like podcasting, is there like a hobby [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8469.8s)]
*  that you have a like a, do you play anything? [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8474.0s)]
*  I just got a piano at home. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8477.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8478.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8479.4s)]
*  So I'm excited about that. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8479.9s)]
*  Did you talk to me about that at one point? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8480.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8481.9s)]
*  I used to play and then I just got a new piano at home. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8482.2s)]
*  It's a U it's a new used piano. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8486.3s)]
*  So yeah, it's a baby grand. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8488.2s)]
*  I think a Baldwin. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8491.0s)]
*  So I got a baby grand. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8492.7s)]
*  I grew up around this place called Baldwin motors. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8494.3s)]
*  They used to do tire care. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8496.7s)]
*  I think we looked at a Baldwin motors Covington, Louisiana. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8497.8s)]
*  So I don't know if they make, I don't know if they also do pianos or this [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8501.2s)]
*  is a family, I don't know. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8503.7s)]
*  It could be joint family, but, um, I mean, it'd be amazing if there's cars and pianos. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8504.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8511.0s)]
*  Well, I think they did some good cars. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8511.300000000001s)]
*  That's Baldwin motors right there. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8512.7s)]
*  I suspect it's not the same, but I, oh, they really upgraded. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8515.5s)]
*  They used to just do mostly tires. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8519.0s)]
*  Well, the Yamaha make pianos and they also make 4,000. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8520.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8525.2s)]
*  They make a lot of things. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8525.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8527.2s)]
*  What about, um, I'm trying to think of something else. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8527.6s)]
*  What else is in the news? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8530.800000000001s)]
*  Zach, anything else neat out there that man ate those chickens, but I didn't really [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8531.7s)]
*  talk about it. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8536.300000000001s)]
*  It didn't do it for me. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8537.2s)]
*  Did it was it just something about it? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8538.5s)]
*  It seems grotesque a little bit, I guess. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8540.2s)]
*  Is it not? [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8542.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8547.1s)]
*  I don't like those rotisserie chickens. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8547.7s)]
*  It just, have you ever seen 40 chickens either? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8549.1s)]
*  It seems like a number of chickens that shouldn't exist all at the same time. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8553.1s)]
*  Well, and it just like, what, you know, I just see some man just pulling and [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8557.0s)]
*  the chicken always feels like it's just barely chicken. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8560.8s)]
*  It just, it feels like they've been through it all, you know? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8563.9s)]
*  Like also if you just put it down to, you know, if we were really to analyze [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8567.099999999999s)]
*  that situation, it's like, it's not that hard to eat 40 chickens every day. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8571.4s)]
*  You know, it's like one chicken every day. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8577.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8579.5s)]
*  Could you imagine, I mean, you could do that. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8580.099999999999s)]
*  I could do that. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8582.8s)]
*  I'm a vegetarian, but I could do that. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8583.599999999999s)]
*  28 days. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8584.599999999999s)]
*  I would not be, I'll be like this. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8585.4s)]
*  I'll be bored. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8587.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8587.8s)]
*  But it's like just watching a man get bored for 40 days. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8588.5s)]
*  Isn't that? [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8590.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8591.9s)]

*  I could really get bored anywhere. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8593.1s)]
*  Someone could, I could watch a man getting bored. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8595.4s)]
*  I could just talk to the person. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8598.9s)]
*  I, Dom, my, my producer co-producer friend asking what it's like to work with me. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8600.2s)]
*  I don't think being bored for 40 days is, is entertainment. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8606.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8610.6s)]
*  As much as those people thought it was. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8611.4s)]
*  Unless it is now, like that's what entertainment also is becoming. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8612.800000000001s)]
*  It's interesting how it's getting strange. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8615.7s)]
*  Like I would watch a woman, like a small woman eat like maybe a hot dog or a [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8617.2s)]
*  piece of cake or something online. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8624.6s)]
*  I would watch it to me. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8627.6s)]
*  That'd be very entertaining. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8629.1s)]
*  I'm now imagining watching you watch her. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8630.2s)]
*  That's why I laughed. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8632.6s)]
*  Well, there's a Japanese show where they have little children go run to [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8633.7s)]

*  It's like a little bit of voiceover and you just watch them go on the little journey. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8641.400000000001s)]
*  It's the show has to be for two to four year olds. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8646.0s)]
*  It is captivating. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8649.6s)]
*  But all of those shows are, I feel like they're universal ages really. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8651.0s)]
*  Well, this one is just something to learn from things like that. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8655.1s)]

*  you know, he just feels sort of out of the game or like not really part of that. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8824.8s)]
*  And he's just expressing himself in all these different ways. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8830.599999999999s)]
*  And we actually did put something out. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8832.699999999999s)]
*  We did make, we did a thing where he was playing clarinet and I was playing piano. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8834.0s)]
*  Um, I don't, I think for me, it's like, I don't, uh, I just want to help as a [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8839.099999999999s)]
*  producer, like, cause I was in a producer role. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8844.699999999999s)]
*  I just want to help someone express the thing they want to express. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8848.3s)]
*  And if Andre 3000 isn't in a time of his life where he wants to make rap music, [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8851.3s)]
*  then I'll help him express clarinet music. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8856.8s)]
*  You're helping him express, maybe even just realize that, Hey, this isn't a [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8861.8s)]
*  time where you want to put something out. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8864.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8865.9s)]
*  Which may change or may not. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8866.3s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8868.3s)]
*  Like a lot of music get put out. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8868.8s)]
*  No, a lot of music doesn't get put out. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8870.9s)]
*  What? [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8873.5s)]
*  Major vast majority of music doesn't get put out. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8874.6s)]
*  Are there some amazing songs out there that you think have been made that [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8877.9s)]
*  were, were not, have not been put out? [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8881.199999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of, a lot of songs out there that I shouldn't think [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8883.6s)]
*  shouldn't have been put out. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8886.699999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of amazing songs I've heard in studios that never came out for sure. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8894.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8897.699999999999s)]
*  Like hundreds, hundreds. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8897.9s)]
*  And they're honestly, it feels like a crime. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8901.0s)]
*  Honestly, it feels like a crime. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8904.199999999999s)]
*  It's, it's terrible. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8905.4s)]
*  When you hear them and you're like, Oh, I can't wait. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8907.699999999999s)]
*  I'll wait for that to come out and people to hear it. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8911.199999999999s)]
*  And yeah, because it's something happens like promo doesn't work out. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8913.199999999999s)]
*  Like someone, somebody like an ANR says, Oh, I'm not really sure about that one. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8917.8s)]
*  Or someone says to the artists, like what a friend of theirs says, Oh, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8921.9s)]
*  I don't like that one. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8925.1s)]
*  It just turns them off it. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8926.4s)]
*  Or they develop negative association with that song. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8928.9s)]
*  It's happened with me plenty of times. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8932.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I've got songs and my hard drive is thousands, thousands of songs [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8933.4s)]
*  that haven't made the cut or they miss their moment. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8938.8s)]
*  You know, some songs just feel like a moment and it's like, if you don't put [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8944.5s)]
*  them out soon, you're not, you just, you're not going to, you're never [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8947.5s)]
*  going to feel like that again. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8951.9s)]
*  Or maybe sometimes like I didn't nail the vocal take. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8953.9s)]
*  I didn't fully know. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8956.9s)]
*  So I don't like the way I'm singing. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8958.199999999999s)]
*  So, and I can't be bothered going back in and singing again. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8959.5s)]
*  So there's all these songs that the actual DNA of the song is good, but [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8962.0s)]
*  you can't be bothered doing it again. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8968.5s)]
*  Going back into that place. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8970.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8972.3s)]
*  And you can't get back there. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8972.5s)]
*  It's kind of the value of a moment. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8974.099999999999s)]
*  It's like, sometimes, you know, it's like, man, we were so [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8975.4s)]
*  close right there for that moment. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8978.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8980.099999999999s)]
*  And it's like, sometimes those things are batches of songs. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8980.5s)]
*  So like there'll be a batch of songs that sounded like retrograde or there'll [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8983.0s)]
*  be a batch of songs that sounded like say what you will, but say what you will [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8987.8s)]
*  was the best of that batch and retrograde was the best of that batch. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8990.5s)]
*  So I put that out instead of lots of kind of kind of similar [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8993.5s)]
*  tone songs in a similar tone that like one is good. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=8999.7s)]
*  Did you ever get to work with like Willie Nelson or John Mayer? [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9003.7s)]
*  I've never worked with either of those. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9008.6s)]
*  No, I never have. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9010.6s)]
*  But you know, never say never. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9012.9s)]
*  I mean, it's willing to, willing Nelson is. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9015.6s)]
*  Willie Nelson is still alive. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9018.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9019.1s)]
*  Still know, is he making music? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9019.6s)]
*  Is he making music? [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9020.6s)]
*  And yeah, I think he is. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9022.199999999999s)]
*  He has a daughter. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9023.699999999999s)]
*  I think Ray, our granddaughter, Ray Lynn Nelson, I think who also does music. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9024.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9029.8s)]
*  Is there an artist that you feel like, I guess you do get pitched artists. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9030.1s)]
*  How does that work? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9032.9s)]
*  Do you pitch your, does your agent kind of pitch you to artists? [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9033.5s)]
*  How does that kind of work? [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9036.6s)]
*  That usually doesn't work out. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9037.6s)]
*  I've found if it's, if there's an A&R connection or some kind of [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9039.6s)]
*  industry connection, it doesn't really. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9043.1s)]
*  You know. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9046.1s)]
*  Usually from me just getting in touch on Instagram and saying like, [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9046.6s)]
*  I love your music or something like that. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9050.800000000001s)]
*  Kind of like how, how we met. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9053.1s)]
*  I mean, obviously we're not collaborating, although this, you [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9055.300000000001s)]
*  could call it a collaboration. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9057.9s)]
*  It's true. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9059.2s)]
*  But you know, we just jam, jam's quite good at just reaching out. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9060.4s)]
*  I've sort of learned that from her. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9066.9s)]
*  She was like, you know, you can just reach out to people directly. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9068.1s)]
*  And I was like, she's great at connecting with people. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9070.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9073.300000000001s)]
*  And she's got time and Rex and he's great at connecting. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9073.7s)]
*  Yes. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9076.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9076.6s)]
*  So that's like two great connectors as you're. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9077.2s)]
*  He's so good in that movie. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9079.4s)]
*  I know. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9082.5s)]
*  The one. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9083.1s)]
*  Red rocket. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9083.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9084.9s)]
*  He's so good in that. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9085.5s)]
*  So ridiculous how they can make it. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9087.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9090.0s)]
*  At the beginning, you're like, oh, this is my buddy Simon by the end. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9090.8s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is this guy. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9092.8s)]
*  I don't want to miss this journey. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9094.1s)]
*  He was brilliant. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9095.2s)]
*  He was so brilliant. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9096.4s)]
*  And he's been staying busy since then. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9097.9s)]
*  It's such a wild. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9099.3s)]
*  What an amazing comeback. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9100.4s)]
*  I know. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9101.7s)]
*  Fantastic to watch. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9102.2s)]
*  Like I was so fucking happy to see that. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9103.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9105.9s)]
*  Hollywood's so interesting like that, you know. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9106.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe come back to maybe the right way. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9109.3s)]
*  Sort of just like a reentry into the right. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9111.3s)]
*  The world. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9114.699999999999s)]
*  He feels like that. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9115.1s)]
*  He'd moved out to the national park. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9115.9s)]
*  He was living in a national park. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9118.6s)]
*  And so that's really like a bear. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9122.199999999999s)]
*  You're at the end of the line. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9122.5s)]
*  Then you're basically a bear when you're living in a national park. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9123.5s)]
*  You're really you're trying to, you know, yeah, you thinking probably about [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9126.1s)]
*  suicide, you're not going to do it. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9129.6s)]
*  There's enough hikes around to keep you safe. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9131.9s)]
*  I'm just joking. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9135.4s)]
*  Simon knows that. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9136.199999999999s)]
*  But he moved out to like Joshua Tree and he was just kind of living his life. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9137.5s)]
*  And then this producer saw him on Instagram and said, you are perfect. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9141.5s)]
*  Yeah, because he's like an incredible looking hilarious person. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9146.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9150.6s)]
*  And he's long and, you know, has some goofy elements and like, but just the [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9150.9s)]
*  biggest heart and so it was really awesome to get to see him like, and just [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9157.6s)]
*  to see his pride that he felt like you want to everybody wants to feel like [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9162.2s)]
*  they are capable maybe, or they matter. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9167.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9172.7s)]
*  Or that they, we all just want to feel a little bit of that. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9173.6s)]
*  Well, like we can just do the thing that we're good at in the lime [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9177.300000000001s)]
*  light for just a moment. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9181.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9182.7s)]
*  And just be like, I did that. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9183.1s)]
*  And, you know, there's definitely a thing inside a lot of the people that's [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9184.800000000001s)]
*  just sort of screaming for that occasionally. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9188.5s)]
*  Every so often. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9192.300000000001s)]
*  And if you can, if you, if you happen to be in a position where you can like [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9193.5s)]
*  satisfy that voice, it's a nice place to be because otherwise that can eat you [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9196.900000000001s)]
*  up on it. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9202.2s)]
*  Like if you just can't ever vocalize it or you can't ever. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9202.7s)]
*  You can't get it satisfied. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9205.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9207.1s)]
*  And it can be satisfied even just in a relationship. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9207.5s)]
*  It could be satisfied by that one person that you're with. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9209.7s)]
*  It could be satisfied by a parent or a child. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9211.900000000001s)]
*  It could be satisfied by a million people. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9214.6s)]
*  You know, it could, it could need to be. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9218.1s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9220.400000000001s)]
*  It just has to land in that place that is set that you feel seen. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9221.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9227.6s)]
*  Yes. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9229.1s)]
*  I, I, uh, and some people that only takes one person, you know, it takes a wife [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9229.5s)]
*  or a girlfriend or boyfriend or a parent. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9234.1s)]
*  Just that's all it takes in there. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9236.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9237.8s)]
*  Or to be the biggest thing in someone's life. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9239.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9241.4s)]
*  Be the center of somebody's kind of universe. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9241.7s)]
*  Um, are you, um, with anyone at the moment? [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9244.3s)]
*  Nope. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9249.3s)]
*  I started doing, I, I, I've been doing a little bit of just. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9250.0s)]
*  Meantime. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9254.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9255.099999999999s)]
*  I took 30 days off of dating so I could get an idea of what I was kind of doing. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9256.099999999999s)]
*  Nice. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9260.4s)]
*  Cause you can get so sporadic. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9260.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9262.3s)]
*  You know, you're just here and there you go on a date. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9262.699999999999s)]
*  Like, do I even care about this? [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9265.3s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9266.4s)]
*  How's that in Los Angeles? [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9267.699999999999s)]
*  Is that difficult? [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9268.8s)]
*  It's been a little rocky. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9270.099999999999s)]
*  Nashville has been even tougher kind of really. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9271.199999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9273.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9273.9s)]
*  Cause I don't go out that much. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9274.099999999999s)]
*  And so it's been kind of a tough place to go, um, you know, to meet folks. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9275.4s)]
*  Do your interests line up with people in LA or in Nashville more? [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9280.3s)]
*  I think they're kind of the same. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9284.3s)]
*  I think it sort of depends. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9285.5s)]
*  I think you can kind of find the same type of people anywhere. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9286.5s)]
*  You know, I'm not like, I'm just kind of middle of the road. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9289.699999999999s)]
*  I, you know, I think I'm trying to think of something that really [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9293.699999999999s)]
*  turns me off about somebody. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9296.199999999999s)]
*  Doing this in a restaurant. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9299.699999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9301.4s)]
*  They're done. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9301.699999999999s)]
*  Done. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9302.6s)]
*  Probably. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9303.3s)]
*  You're out. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9304.199999999999s)]
*  But if they're attractive enough, you might. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9305.1s)]
*  I would probably still order dessert with them, you know, so I'd mill around a bit. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9310.6s)]
*  So if they did that through start a main course and dessert and they're just [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9314.900000000001s)]
*  putting the weight over like that. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9318.6s)]
*  Unless they were like setting up in Tamit or for some dope ass beat that I didn't [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9320.1s)]
*  know was coming, you know, or it was like a flash mob or something that never started. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9323.2s)]
*  They're just like, Hey guys, can we? [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9328.2s)]
*  They think it's going to happen as long as they just keep. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9329.800000000001s)]
*  So, um, have you gotten invited to go play at like some weird private events or [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9332.0s)]
*  something that was really interesting? [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9336.300000000001s)]
*  You're like, okay, this seems strange or not strange. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9337.6s)]
*  I've done some cool. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9340.6s)]
*  I've done a couple of corporate things that I ended up not doing anymore after [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9341.4s)]
*  that, because I just felt like a couple of fashion events and things were very [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9344.7s)]
*  Zoolander type stuff. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9350.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9351.4s)]
*  You know. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9352.0s)]
*  But no, I don't think I, you know, I haven't had the like, [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9356.0s)]
*  I haven't had the sort of surreal experience. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9360.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9365.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9366.199999999999s)]
*  I haven't really had that in music. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9366.699999999999s)]
*  Some crazy thing where they invite you like a big bean conference or something. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9368.0s)]
*  Everybody's losing their mind or something. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9371.6s)]
*  No. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9373.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9373.6s)]
*  But, and if, and the things I have done that were a bit weird, I think I'm under [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9375.8s)]
*  contract to not talk about. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9381.0s)]
*  The thing, when I say a bit weird, I mean like, yeah, I mean, I think I'm [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9385.8s)]
*  like, yeah, like, like maybe, maybe it's not the kind of gig that like it was a [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9390.0s)]
*  shit gig. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9400.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9401.6s)]
*  It's like a really shit gig. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9402.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9403.9s)]
*  And there's, and I was like, okay, let's not have any videos of that one. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9404.3s)]
*  Well, thanks for all your contributions, man. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9411.0s)]
*  I'm glad that we get to spend some time together, you know? [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9413.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9417.4s)]
*  I mean, and I'd love to, you know, this is, I've never done this sort of, I've [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9417.8s)]
*  never been part of the podcasting universe particularly. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9423.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9426.199999999999s)]
*  It's great. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9427.099999999999s)]
*  I'm really glad that you came on. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9428.199999999999s)]
*  Well, it felt like just like walking through the screen in a way, walking into this [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9432.9s)]
*  thing. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9436.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9437.5s)]
*  It was like just jumping through YouTube because I've watched your podcast so many times. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9442.4s)]
*  Do a lot of people say that? [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9443.3s)]
*  What, that you've watched it? [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9444.8s)]
*  No, that you, well, that they've just, they've been, you know, they've watched your [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9445.9s)]
*  shit for so long and then they're just like in the seat where other people are sitting. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9449.199999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9453.0s)]
*  I think it's kind of fascinating to people. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9453.5s)]
*  I think people don't know what to think sometimes. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9455.1s)]
*  I think they're a little bit shocked at just how the production works. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9457.1s)]
*  And then suddenly you're there. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9461.8s)]
*  It is interesting how it goes from just us sitting here talking into like a [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9463.1s)]
*  conversation that people could listen to or segments of a conversation. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9467.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9470.4s)]
*  You know? [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9470.9s)]
*  I mean, we probably like, I feel like our conversations are pretty wide reaching anyway. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9471.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9478.3s)]
*  This reminding me, I think a lot of like why I always have enjoyed chatting with you, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9479.0s)]
*  you know? [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9484.1s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9484.4s)]
*  It's been a long time. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9484.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9485.5s)]
*  What would you say, like you think to like, yeah, I know this is kind of a general thing, [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9487.1s)]
*  but it's like if there's somebody who's having trouble expressing themselves or [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9489.9s)]
*  figuring out how to do that, what suggestion do you think you would give to [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9493.699999999999s)]
*  somebody like that? [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9499.699999999999s)]
*  Well, I'd say try a few different things. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9502.4s)]
*  And if you express yourself to someone and they kind of like lightly punish you [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9510.6s)]
*  for doing it, whether that's rejecting you or whatever it is, then maybe they're [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9518.199999999999s)]
*  just not the right person to do that with. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9523.8s)]
*  But there will be someone who will... [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9525.699999999999s)]
*  Like your music. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9529.9s)]
*  Yeah, like your music or like they'll take you as you are basically as a person. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9530.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's so much. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9537.9s)]
*  We spend so much of our time trying to adjust our song to fit the audience [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9538.800000000001s)]
*  instead of finding the person that hears it. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9543.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9545.7s)]
*  And to be, I think true confidence is just being confident that, sorry, [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9546.1s)]
*  using it twice, but true confidence is being in a situation and just [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9552.800000000001s)]
*  knowing that you'd be okay if that person didn't like what you said or [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9559.7s)]
*  didn't like, you know, kind of rejected you or whatever. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9564.7s)]
*  And that's hard to get to. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9567.5s)]
*  Even now I find that pretty difficult. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9569.2s)]
*  But, and in so many ways I've edited myself to death, like to be okay [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9573.1s)]
*  for everyone else's consumption. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9579.400000000001s)]
*  But I think to some extent it's like kind of saying what's on your [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9580.8s)]
*  mind anyway and come what may. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9591.199999999999s)]
*  Because ultimately the fastest way to find out if you're in the right [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9595.699999999999s)]
*  situation is to be yourself. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9599.699999999999s)]
*  And you can spend many years doing the opposite, not being yourself and [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9601.8s)]
*  hoping that people will accept you. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9609.1s)]
*  And ultimately you're just treading water. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9612.6s)]
*  You're never going to, you're never going to fully swim. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9614.800000000001s)]
*  You'll, you'll only, you'll never scratch the full itch of, of you and, and [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9617.6s)]
*  friendship and love and real connection because you've never been your true [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9626.5s)]
*  self and being willing to let things go by. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9633.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9636.800000000001s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9637.1s)]
*  Relationships, friends, like all sorts of things. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9637.4s)]
*  Like things that may not, yeah. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9639.699999999999s)]
*  Being willing to say this isn't it right now. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9641.8s)]
*  This isn't, you know, I struggle with that with dating and stuff to be like, [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9643.699999999999s)]
*  I'm just afraid to let go because what it, you know, it's just such a reaction. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9647.9s)]
*  You know, what if some part of me, there's a subconscious part of me that's [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9651.9s)]
*  what if there's nothing else, you know? [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9655.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9656.8s)]
*  Is there like, have you met people where you've, you've kind of felt like now [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9657.1s)]
*  the idea of them not being there is too scary to actually leave the situation. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9662.0s)]
*  Even though it's probably not right. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9667.2s)]
*  Oh, I think that's happened to me before in the past for sure. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9668.5s)]
*  You know, I think taking some time from dating and stuff helps me get a better [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9671.0s)]
*  view of that and see it, you know? [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9675.1s)]
*  Um, what are the apps? [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9677.5s)]
*  I mean, I've been in a relationship for eight years. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9679.800000000001s)]
*  What are the apps now? [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9681.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9682.300000000001s)]
*  What do you use? [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9682.400000000001s)]
*  I just got on, I just created a profile on Raya, but I haven't opened it. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9682.800000000001s)]
*  I haven't started it. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9686.300000000001s)]
*  All right. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9687.300000000001s)]
*  So I'm not sure if I want to, I've kind of like, it's been like a month [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9687.7s)]
*  now that I've had it and I just don't know if I, I just don't know how much [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9691.300000000001s)]
*  I want to be spending my time trying to manage that. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9695.9s)]
*  And then how much do I want to just kind of let it happen? [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9702.199999999999s)]
*  But totally. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9704.8s)]
*  And also when your job, I mean, I guess you meet a lot of people in your job. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9706.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9711.199999999999s)]
*  You meet a decent amount. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9711.4s)]
*  A lot of them is men. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9712.5s)]
*  That's, that's true. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9713.8s)]
*  Although you could, you could change that. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9714.699999999999s)]
*  I guess you could just start inviting more people. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9716.6s)]
*  You might find more like minds in, in, in the, in the female space. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9718.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9724.199999999999s)]
*  I might have to get, I can get a couple more names around, you know, [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9724.4s)]
*  wouldn't be a bad idea. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9727.0s)]
*  But the, I remember being on in my, in my year, I think between two [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9728.0s)]
*  relationships, being single and having a Raya account and the one of the, I [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9732.5s)]
*  was like scrolling and the one of the interests someone put was coconut oil. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9738.8s)]
*  And I just closed the app and deleted it. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9745.5s)]
*  And then there's no going back. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9747.699999999999s)]
*  That's, uh, it just seems too surface level. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9752.199999999999s)]
*  Like, um, James Blake, man, thank you so much for spending time, brother. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9755.1s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9761.699999999999s)]

*  It's so nice to be here and thanks for having me. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9762.9s)]

*  And it's great to actually see the place. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9769.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9774.199999999999s)]
*  Welcome to inside of the internet, man. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9774.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9777.0s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9777.199999999999s)]
*  Thank you for all your wonderful music. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9777.699999999999s)]
*  And, um, is there music that people can like, you know, it's such a generic [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9779.0s)]
*  question, but yo, is there, you're going to keep making music. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9782.5s)]
*  That's the plan. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9786.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9787.5s)]
*  I'm going to keep making it. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9787.9s)]
*  Um, the next thing I think is going to be more of a dance oriented slash [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9790.0s)]
*  more electronic type thing, um, which I've just, um, yeah, I'm in the process [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9794.6s)]
*  of finishing, but who knows how long that kind of thing takes. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9800.1s)]
*  So, but I'm also, I'm, I've got a club night that I'm doing at the moment [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9804.6s)]
*  CMYK, uh, in partnership with Rhonda, uh, a club named Rhonda, um, Rhonda [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9808.24s)]

*  Now I'm just on the breeze and I feel like these leaves, I must be. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9835.14s)]
*  But when I reached that ground, I'll share this piece of my life. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcCo9eBGi5o&t=9846.84s)]
