*  The worst thing that happened the worst [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  You'd make the thing you'd put the cooler in there with a little cool aid that was it making our cool [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1027.32s)]
*  A sometimes it was too strong you had that [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1032.5s)]
*  That shit what they would just make it damn it would make your fucking neck retract [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1036.46s)]
*  You'd look like a turtle and you know for the second half of the afternoon [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1042.58s)]
*  You couldn't even play hide-and-go-seek cuz you couldn't look around my your neck was if you if you made that cool [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1048.26s)]
*  A powder too strong [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1053.58s)]
*  Cuz when I was young you had to get the powder and get the water you had to do a little bit of science, baby [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1056.26s)]
*  Now it comes prepackaged. It's all done for you [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1062.62s)]
*  When I was young you had to do a little bit of the work [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1066.74s)]
*  And I'd make my lunch. I put the cool age [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1070.38s)]
*  Get the thermos then the thermos had a little lid on it that you could use [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1074.54s)]
*  You would take the lid off and drink out of the lid little cup like you worked at a factory or something. It's like bitch [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1079.9s)]
*  This YMCA summer camp [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1087.78s)]
*  Okay, and most of the counselors dude are you know work at the bank [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1090.66s)]
*  So let's be realistic about what's going on here. We're not doing any sheet metal out here [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1095.26s)]
*  But the worst thing that happened was [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1103.9s)]
*  My sandwich I get me a little sandwich [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1106.8200000000002s)]
*  usually peanut butter and jelly [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1109.6200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes honestly [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1113.42s)]
*  Double peanut butter [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1117.14s)]
*  I [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1120.14s)]
*  Go no jelly, bro, so now I might go no jelly [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1125.98s)]
*  And my sisters I know would get mad we make our sandwiches [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1131.46s)]
*  Sometimes I would come down before we made them. I [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1135.14s)]
*  Would get extra peanut butter put it on the inside of the jelly jar [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1138.22s)]
*  Then I would have them just think I was doing jelly [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1143.5s)]
*  Because that's why I live I lived in a place where every freaking ounce was accounted for [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1147.9s)]

*  He kind of stayed away from people it seemed like to me [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=1644.6000000000001s)]

*  In some comedians they make it's a maze [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2283.96s)]
*  It's a maze that sits between them and the world [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2286.84s)]
*  And the way that the humor is created is [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2296.28s)]
*  Is that some people have such a unique maze some people set up punch that's a small maze set up punch [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2305.08s)]
*  Some people it's the element of surprise some people it's [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2311.3199999999997s)]
*  It's just extremely direct and dry [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2316.52s)]
*  But I think norm just had his maze was just different [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2320.6s)]
*  And I don't think you can create that I think it's built into you [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2325.56s)]
*  and uh [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2330.2s)]
*  Yeah [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2333.3199999999997s)]
*  One of a kind man [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2336.8399999999997s)]
*  One of a kind man and he had a great quote too about uh cancer [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2339.8s)]
*  He said cancer doesn't I think it was him [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2345.8s)]
*  I don't know people have been saying it was him [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2348.6800000000003s)]
*  If cancer doesn't beat you because when you die it dies at the same time. So technically it's a draw [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2351.56s)]
*  Let me get this right [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2359.4s)]
*  Um [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2369.8s)]
*  Yeah norm once ripped the term battling cancer in the old days [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2372.92s)]
*  A man could just get sick and die now. They have to wage a battle [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2379.7200000000003s)]
*  Shit this is one of those sites you got to pay the shit just to read the shit the local shit like fuck [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2385.56s)]
*  Brittany got gunned down at a Popeye's and now I gotta pay eight dollars to read it [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2393.4s)]
*  But that's what it is it was that cancer the cancer dies when you die so technically it's a draw but man [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2404.52s)]
*  I'm curious to see where he pops up in the realm of existence next [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2413.48s)]
*  You might see a sheep doing something weird or you might see a [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2417.8s)]
*  You might see this uh, I don't know a moose [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2423.2400000000002s)]
*  Having quite a time and that could be him. God bless you. Norm Macdonald, man [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2428.84s)]
*  You know and he did he kind of disappeared out of the you know [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2436.04s)]
*  He did that show with Adam E get a lot of great jim carrey moments from there [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2438.44s)]
*  And then he kind of you didn't see him much but uh one of a kind. Anyway, I'll keep moving here [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2442.44s)]
*  What else do we have here? Um [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2447.48s)]
*  Here is a question right here that came in this is a video question [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2449.8s)]
*  Hey, Theo [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2454.92s)]
*  So far the aaa meetings and shit like that hasn't related to me so much [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2456.12s)]
*  Your podcast is related to me far more [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2462.04s)]
*  if you ever had any interest in [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2464.76s)]
*  Maybe starting somewhat of an aaa group [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2467.64s)]
*  Of your own maybe some of your [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2470.92s)]
*  podcast listeners who could [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2473.56s)]
*  Just a random idea thrown out there [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2475.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe there are more people like me gang gang, baby [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2478.2s)]
*  Gang brother. Thank you for that suggestion, man. And um [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2481.64s)]
*  You know, it's so funny that [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2486.04s)]
*  That you say that because I I I was just thinking the other day [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2488.52s)]
*  I was at a zoom. I went to a zoom aaa meeting in new york. It was a new york when I came [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2491.96s)]
*  Sometimes it's fun. You can get on there. Some of them they don't have a lot of time [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2496.92s)]
*  They're like, oh, I'm going to do a zoom aaa meeting [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2499.96s)]
*  When I think sometimes it's fun you can get on there some of them they don't have all the passwords. It's hard to get in [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2501.96s)]
*  Sometimes you get in [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2508.12s)]
*  You know [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2511.48s)]
*  The other day a guy he's like I never shared before in a meeting but I see my boy Theo in here I'm gonna share [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2514.2s)]
*  You know made me feel nice. Obviously you didn't I mean it didn't you know [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2519.7200000000003s)]
*  It made me feel welcome. We all just want to feel welcome. I think it's a thing amongst people that suffer from [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2525.48s)]
*  Or just people in general. So we all just want to feel welcome in the world [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2531.96s)]
*  uh, and in a moment [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2535.64s)]
*  You know, I think a lot of us maybe had moments when we were young where we didn't feel welcome [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2538.84s)]
*  In that moment [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2544.28s)]
*  And I know that's a real particular and kind of fucking weak thing to say [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2546.92s)]
*  But enough of those stack up and it can really build up in you [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2552.6s)]
*  But the answer is yeah, man, I just was thinking about that the other day [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2555.32s)]
*  So that what a what a real gift that you and I are on some sort of same balance beam man [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2557.96s)]
*  And you're hitting this idea. I thought about that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2562.44s)]
*  What would it be like to have a zoom? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2566.36s)]
*  I think when i'm able to keep some good time together, man, i'll really look into that [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2569.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, i'm working with a four-step right now and um [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2575.08s)]
*  And I appreciate you asking though brother. I appreciate you thinking about me man [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2579.7200000000003s)]

*  Thank you very much for watching young lady onward [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2601.7200000000003s)]
*  like every night i've been watching for like two or three years now and i'm noticing that [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2604.92s)]
*  You don't really have no [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2611.8s)]
*  Black women on your show like I don't think you've ever had a black woman on either one of your shows actually [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2613.64s)]
*  and [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2619.08s)]
*  I'm scrolling through and it's like everybody [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2620.6s)]
*  But no black women [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2624.2799999999997s)]
*  So I ain't trying to say nothing when i'm saying nothing, but you know, what's up? Because you got black girl fans, too [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2625.96s)]
*  Uh, thank you young lady for the question. That's a great question, you know, um [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2632.12s)]
*  You're right [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2636.6s)]
*  You're right. I was just thinking about this as you're saying it. Um [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2637.96s)]
*  The closest we've had to a black woman is probably [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2644.04s)]
*  Donnell Rollins dude, honestly, i'm real honest. Um, yeah, I know we asked miss pat to come on [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2648.92s)]
*  Recently she didn't she did not want to she doesn't live uh, she was living in atlanta so we weren't able to get her [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2659.4s)]
*  It's a good point [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2667.0s)]
*  It's a good point. Um [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2669.32s)]
*  Um [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2671.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think I just don't run it [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2672.84s)]
*  I don't i'm not in a lot of circles where I see a lot of black women [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2674.28s)]
*  But I think i'll have to keep my eyes and ears open more [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2677.32s)]
*  And see if we can find some great guests. I know there are great guests out there [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2681.48s)]

*  Yeah, i'll do what I can, you know [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2700.12s)]
*  I don't want to do it just because I feel like I need like I don't like anything like that [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2701.32s)]
*  That feels real forced and I know you're not saying that [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2704.92s)]
*  um [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2707.8s)]
*  But I know a lot of amazing black women, so i'm sure I can find some [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2709.32s)]
*  I can ask some of them [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2714.2s)]

*  So I feel you. Thank you very much for the question. That's a good and fair question [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2730.52s)]

*  Do you relate more? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2757.4s)]
*  closely to uh like black culture ethnic culture [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2759.16s)]
*  and caucasian american culture [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2763.3999999999996s)]
*  um, it seems like caucasian american [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2766.44s)]
*  mixed breeds like yourself like myself [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2770.52s)]
*  Kind of starting to get away from those little crispy crunchy white white folk [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2773.3199999999997s)]
*  And so just kind of let me know what you think man. She's a player keep it that way all day [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2778.3599999999997s)]
*  Uh, have a good one [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2783.7999999999997s)]
*  Gang, thank you michael. It's a good question, man [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2785.72s)]
*  You know, I think at different points in my life. I've had some different moments and experiences [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2788.28s)]
*  uh [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2793.48s)]
*  You know, I always hated rich people growing up [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2794.92s)]
*  And i'm sorry if anybody's rich man [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2797.6400000000003s)]
*  but [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2800.44s)]
*  Y'all were the enemy man, you know, I was real we were impoverished and [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2803.0800000000004s)]
*  And at that point when sometimes when you're poor you're an underdog you gotta have [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2809.4s)]
*  Somebody to fight it you got to have somebody on the other end of that, uh, that teeter totter [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2813.72s)]
*  You get this he's got to be somebody over there [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2823.16s)]
*  So I think that you know, I think that I think I was [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2826.3599999999997s)]
*  Angry at the rich man [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2831.16s)]
*  And it was a lot of rich white people, you know where I was at [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2833.56s)]
*  They didn't have anybody else really to be rich [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2836.9199999999996s)]
*  And my neighbors were poor white people and poor black people so [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2840.2s)]
*  I certainly associated more at that point in my life with black culture [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2845.64s)]
*  And I was in a group, uh [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2850.2s)]
*  I was in like a little gang. We were shitty real shitty gang, but it was black children [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2852.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, I used to I got tickled by a black man one time [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2858.2s)]
*  When I was bathing somewhere outside at my friend's house [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2863.0s)]
*  My friend devon who was black he still is black [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2866.84s)]
*  And um [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2871.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I think when I really had such a underdog mentality the only underdog at that time was [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2875.4s)]
*  It felt like in america was black [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2882.04s)]
*  In my area in louisiana was just black and white [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2884.84s)]
*  So anything that was like against the rich [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2889.24s)]
*  You know, I remember being a jesse jackson fan growing up [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2892.12s)]
*  That kind of shit [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2896.12s)]
*  um [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2898.36s)]
*  Now things are more merged kind of now [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2901.0s)]
*  So, I don't know sometimes what cult I don't know if I associate with a lot of I think it's a little I take I [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2907.8s)]
*  You know, I like a little bit of all of it [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2915.24s)]
*  Um [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2919.8s)]
*  I also think blm during the blm movement. It made me kind of skate like I felt like everybody was on the same page. We're all [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2922.28s)]
*  Feeling good about about stuff and moving together as a group [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2933.0s)]
*  Sometimes during blm, I felt like [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2939.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh black people or or not black people because that's too general but that blm the movement itself [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2943.0800000000004s)]
*  They don't want to be a part of everyone they want their own thing [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2948.84s)]
*  um [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2953.1600000000003s)]
*  So that made me feel like unwelcome sometimes in black in some black areas [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2955.2400000000002s)]
*  or [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2962.1200000000003s)]
*  Or even just in my mind maybe just in my mind, maybe not actually [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2963.1600000000003s)]
*  in in physical areas [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2967.1600000000003s)]
*  But i'd always felt like we're all on the same page and then some of the blm stuff made was like oh [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2970.84s)]
*  This group wants [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2978.84s)]
*  It felt like a lot of people wanted black supremacy. I don't like any kind of supremacy. That's what I don't like [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2980.6000000000004s)]
*  um [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2987.08s)]
*  You know, I never related with redneck cult like and not saying redneck is why I never related with any uh [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=2989.48s)]

*  Yeah, I don't know why that hit me kind of you know, I think uh [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3556.3s)]
*  I think ever since I was you know or something, you know [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3562.7000000000003s)]
*  I always i'm always based it on like if I don't do [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3564.78s)]
*  Everything who whatever [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3569.98s)]
*  There's always been something in me that if I don't do [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3576.5400000000004s)]
*  Or if I don't behave a certain way or do a certain thing then i'm not enough, you know [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3579.9s)]
*  That if I don't work hard enough or I don't try or I don't say the right if I don't do you know [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3586.94s)]
*  That here's what it is that my value is contingent upon my output [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3595.5s)]
*  And that my value is not contingent upon [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3605.42s)]
*  Solely the fact that I exist and that I am me [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3610.6200000000003s)]
*  Me [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3616.22s)]
*  So that I think is part of the reason why I have that thing where I just feel like I have to just keep going you know [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3622.62s)]
*  And I i'm recognizing that that's not a that's a false that's a false god [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3633.1s)]
*  Whatever that's a false god [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3642.54s)]
*  Because no real [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3644.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's just not real [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3648.7799999999997s)]
*  You know and I think that a lot of that comes when you don't feel like [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3655.1s)]
*  And this is a little sappy man, but this is what I feel and i'm okay [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3659.1s)]
*  If you don't like this kind of shit, then that's fine bro. Go watch football fam. I'll be watching later, too [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3662.38s)]

*  Um [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3674.86s)]
*  But yeah, it's like [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3678.38s)]
*  If [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3681.7400000000002s)]
*  That the value of who I am to you is based on what I do and not who I am [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3684.3s)]
*  or not [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3690.46s)]
*  Solely that I am [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3691.98s)]
*  Solely that I am [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3694.06s)]
*  You know and that's like [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3701.82s)]
*  You know, I had I dated a gal for a while and I know and this is the only time I ever felt different in my [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3705.26s)]
*  life about that [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3709.66s)]
*  Actually two times I dated a girl recently a few years ago and I know she loved me unconditionally [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3713.1s)]
*  You know and [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3720.86s)]
*  I took advantage of that some but I know that she did [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3722.3s)]
*  She loved me just because of who just because that I was [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3727.98s)]
*  A person, you know [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3732.7000000000003s)]

*  And i'm not crying right now i'm fucking sweating out of my eyes because i'm doing work fam, that's why [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3756.7000000000003s)]
*  You could lift all the weights you want on the outside, but my weight is inside [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3763.1800000000003s)]
*  um [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3768.86s)]
*  So [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3773.1000000000004s)]

*  Because some of it is just those old stories that are in your head like oh man if I don't try harder if I don't do [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3783.8999999999996s)]

*  But i'm saying that moments like this at least help me recognize it [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3795.02s)]
*  And remind me of it [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3798.8599999999997s)]
*  Because i'll recognize something [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3801.1s)]
*  Then I get so high on recognizing it that I don't even do the work to try and remember [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBFvpI0WFQ&t=3803.74s)]
