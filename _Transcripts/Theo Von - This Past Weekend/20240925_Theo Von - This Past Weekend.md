*  Oh, thanks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=118.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=119.88s)]
*  We've been really fortunate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=120.88s)]
*  We've been working really hard over the past two years, been working really hard and I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=121.88s)]
*  think luck has kind of met us along the way. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  I'll take luck every time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=128.88s)]
*  Will you? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  Does that come up to play in your business at your level or do you still think there's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=132.76000000000002s)]
*  a level of luck to it or what do you kind of? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  Luck is about scale, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  As an entrepreneur, I think, okay, I can start a business. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=140.36s)]
*  I can make some money. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=142.24s)]
*  I can be okay, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=144.24s)]
*  But if you want to have a B next to your name, you got to have a lot of motherfucking luck, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=146.0s)]
*  right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  So in my case, I started the first streaming company, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Which would have been cool, but it happened right at the time the internet stock market [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  was blowing up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  If the internet stock market wasn't blowing up at the same time, you'd have no idea who [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=157.96s)]
*  I am. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=161.52s)]
*  Oh, you mean because of, so there was a level of luck to it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=162.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=164.72s)]
*  So the first streaming company was? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=165.72s)]
*  It's called AudioNet. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=167.0s)]
*  We started in 1995 when nobody knew what streaming was, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=168.28s)]
*  We called it internet broadcasting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=171.72s)]
*  And so we started out a second bedroom, my house, just a setup just like this and bought [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  myself a PC and connected it, found a local radio station that I could connect everything [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=179.0s)]
*  to, went online and I would go and just say, okay, if you want to listen to Dallas sports [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  or news from anywhere in the world, come to this website, audio net dot com. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  And it just blew up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  And then we got a video and changed the name to broadcast dot com. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=194.5s)]
*  When public in 1998, it was the biggest IPO in the history of the stock market at the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=202.12s)]
*  So that's how you started. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=203.12s)]
*  This is a loose term. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  I know you've done other things, but that's how you started to make some money. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's when I got that's when I crushed it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  When you when because that's when the dot coms like if they had it was it sandals dot [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  com sold for like 20 million. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was insane, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  And so but we were legit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=219.76s)]
*  We were YouTube before YouTube, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=220.76s)]
*  And so we were the biggest by far. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't even close. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=224.72s)]
*  And so, you know, we were the first to do basketball, football, baseball, you name it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  First ones to stream anything, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  And then when public, great. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  And then we sold to Yahoo and then Yahoo fucked it up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  That's another story. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=237.76s)]
*  Oh, Yahoo bought a lot of things that they fucked up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=238.76s)]
*  Can we say that? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you can say that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because they made some poor choices. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  I was working at Yahoo. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=244.76s)]
*  I was working over there doing interviews with folks and they bought. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=245.96s)]
*  What was the website they bought that for a crazy amount of money? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=251.16s)]
*  It was blogs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=255.84s)]
*  People did blogs on it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they've bought in a bunch, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=258.56s)]
*  And for whatever reason, they could not get it right for anything. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=261.22s)]
*  And they I mean, they bought us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=264.2s)]
*  They bought all these different companies that at the time were huge. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=266.08s)]
*  Yeah, GeoCities. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=268.92s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=270.52s)]
*  They bought that before us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=271.52s)]
*  GeoCities was one. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=272.52s)]
*  But there was one that was the blog website that everybody used. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=273.52s)]
*  They kind of had a basic template to it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=275.72s)]
*  Mash Tumblr. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, Tumblr. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, Tumblr was hot. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=285.0s)]
*  Then it went porn, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=286.0s)]
*  Did it go porn? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=287.0s)]
*  I'm glad I got out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah, it went porn for a little while. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=289.0s)]
*  And then then this dude I know, Matt, bought it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=290.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  And so now he's just trying to make it work. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  Oh, trying to refinance it? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because that was a crazy buy that they had. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  I remember we were working there. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  We're like, you're buying a blog? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  Like that just felt like you're headed to the past kind of. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=301.48s)]
*  And now then they were part of Verizon. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=305.04s)]
*  Then they got bought by Apollo. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=307.04s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=308.04s)]
*  I mean, I still use Yahoo Finance, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=309.76s)]
*  It's not like people don't use it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=311.6s)]
*  They just haven't been able to get ahead of the game. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=313.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=315.44s)]
*  They had some stake in Alibaba, too, that company. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=316.44s)]
*  Yeah, and that's where they made some money. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=318.16s)]
*  I think that really kept them kind of in the vibe. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=319.8s)]
*  It obviously helped their coffers. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=325.0s)]
*  But yeah, they made some poor choices, I think. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=326.52s)]
*  I mean, hell, they were paying me. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=328.24s)]
*  So obviously they were. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=329.48s)]
*  So they made one smart move, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=330.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=332.48s)]
*  I was there like maybe 2010 or something. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because I was too close. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  2000. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=341.48s)]
*  So you were there like... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=342.48s)]
*  2014 or something, I was there, actually. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=343.48s)]
*  Who was the CEO when you were there? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=345.48s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  It was a female CEO. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, they had just got her in, actually. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, what the fuck was her name? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  She was cute, actually. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  I never got a close up look at her. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, well, yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, I met her one time and I wish I'd met her more than one time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  That's all I remember. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Marissa Meyer. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  I remember her. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  I remember her. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  I remember her. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  I remember her. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  I remember her. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  Marissa Meyer. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=363.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=364.2s)]
*  Oh, Marissa Meyer was great, but they had another lady, too, that worked kind of over [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=365.2s)]
*  us in the video department. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=368.4s)]
*  All this Diddy stuff going on, man, what do you... [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=371.08s)]
*  I'm sure glad that I didn't hang out with him, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  You never were in his universe. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  I've met him, right, but never went out, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  And actually back in 2003, he reached out to me, to the Mavs, and wanted to design a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  uniform for us. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  And I never met him. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=387.52s)]
*  We did it all via email. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=388.52s)]
*  And so he had some of his designers get in touch with me, and they put together some, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=389.56s)]
*  and it was a cool looking uniform, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=393.88s)]
*  We used it for a couple of years, but that was the extent of my connection to Diddy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=396.52s)]
*  I never hung out or did anything. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=400.56s)]
*  And I hung out enough in LA, but I never really heard stories about the parties or anything [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=402.76s)]
*  like that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=408.08s)]
*  That was my scene. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=409.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of... [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=410.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would just hear stuff sometimes, like I would hear certain things, but it was never [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=411.08s)]
*  anything like, oh, this is exactly what's going on. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=414.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=417.48s)]
*  You would think somebody would say something. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=418.6s)]
*  How do you keep that quiet for so long? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=419.88s)]
*  You know, all those videos, it's not like people didn't like... [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=421.36s)]
*  I don't care if you take people's phones, right? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  Someone's sneaking in a phone, and shit like that's happening. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing that if they say all the things are true, that he was able to just [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=428.76s)]
*  do that for so long, you know? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  What is a level like... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=435.92s)]
*  Is it scary when people get to a level of wealth that they can kind of have anything? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=438.0s)]
*  Like, what is some of that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=443.16s)]
*  See, I don't look at it that way, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=444.16s)]
*  I'm not saying you do, either. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=445.64000000000004s)]
*  No, no, I hear you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, like what are the options, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=447.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=449.76s)]
*  Like, if you're rich as fuck, what can you do and get in the way with, right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=450.76s)]
*  I don't hang out with people like that, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=454.64s)]
*  I always looked at it that, like, my high school buddies are still my high school buddies, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=456.68s)]
*  right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=460.52s)]
*  The guys, you know, my rugby teammates in Indiana, my Indiana buddies, those are my friends. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=461.52s)]
*  The guys... [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=465.24s)]
*  I lived six guys in a three-bedroom apartment when I moved to Dallas. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=466.24s)]
*  Those are my friends, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  So it's not like, okay, I'm getting the butlers, I'm getting the chauffeur, and... [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  Look at me, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=473.96s)]
*  And I came by myself. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=474.96s)]
*  I don't give a shit about that stuff. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=475.96s)]
*  Yeah, I was kind of wondering, I was like, how will he show up? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=478.0s)]
*  Will a stork drop him off? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=480.8s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=482.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=483.28s)]
*  But that doesn't mean it hasn't crossed my mind, right? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=484.28s)]
*  It's just like, you have to be... [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=486.64s)]
*  In order to do shit like Diddy or anybody like that, you have to be so paranoid, right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=489.68s)]
*  You have to try to think of every base to cover, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=495.46s)]
*  And you know, now part of me wishes I had done, because there's too many pictures of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=499.36s)]
*  me out drunk with my friends and shit like that, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=502.4s)]
*  But I just don't like to live paranoid, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  I just... [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=510.08s)]
*  I mean, I love having a lot of money. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=511.08s)]
*  It's a whole lot better to be rich than it is to be broke. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=512.48s)]
*  But I was happy when I was poor. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=515.6s)]
*  I just was happier when I was rich. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=517.6s)]
*  And so I don't get that whole thing of, you know, like, just be protective and like, play [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=519.48s)]
*  the rich game, right? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=525.84s)]
*  That's just not my style. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=527.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=528.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of it, I think, play the rich game, like. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=529.0s)]
*  But do you, like, do you see people... [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=531.48s)]
*  Like, do you ever, like... [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=534.24s)]
*  Because that's the thing, like, people get so much money and then they get power too, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=535.24s)]
*  or some of them get one or the other, maybe both. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=539.32s)]
*  But then, like, how does that infect people? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=541.92s)]
*  Do you see that that could, that that infects some people? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=543.96s)]
*  Have you ever witnessed it? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=546.76s)]
*  Yeah, oh, for sure. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=547.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=548.92s)]
*  So, like, people who think because they're rich, they're smarter, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=549.92s)]
*  That they have more privilege, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=553.32s)]
*  They can get away with whatever they want. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=555.16s)]
*  Yeah, particularly in business, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=556.6s)]
*  So if you talk to somebody that may be richer than me, right, who will say shit that's just [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=558.12s)]
*  crazy, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=562.08s)]
*  And think, OK, because I said it, that's what's up, right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  That's, that's, that's, it's right, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  Or more likely, though, in my experiences, like, I'll get invited to these parties, right, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=568.2800000000001s)]
*  that are really nice house and stuff, right? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  But there'll be, like, 50 servants, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=576.24s)]
*  Five people to answer the door, six people that just specialize in toast, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=580.32s)]
*  Just ridiculous shit, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=584.9200000000001s)]
*  And all of them, like, how do you live like this? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, because it's bad enough, like, I have too big a house. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=588.48s)]
*  And so you have to have people there to clean it and stuff like that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  And there's no privacy just with that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  And there's people that'll have, like, 10 people in the house at all times. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=596.4s)]
*  And I don't see how they live, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=600.24s)]
*  So for some people, maybe it's, like, showing off. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  To me, it's just like, why would you live that way? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=605.56s)]
*  Right? I'm happy to have all this money because I can live the way I want, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=607.9599999999999s)]
*  as opposed to live the way somebody thinks I should. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=611.92s)]
*  And I just get the sense, to your point, that some people get to that level and say, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  OK, this is what I'm supposed to do, right? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=618.56s)]
*  I'm supposed to have this type of car. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=620.52s)]
*  I'm supposed to have this many people working for me at the house. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=623.0s)]
*  I'm supposed to have this type of porcelain, you know, China or whatever. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  Toilet, whatever that is. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=630.36s)]
*  But I am going to say one of the things I got, I got a heated toilet seat. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=632.5600000000001s)]

*  where like they got to levels of wealth [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=702.36s)]
*  and power that they started that it veers into like a lot of sexual, like, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=706.08s)]

*  a tendency to choose or do something regularly, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=742.2800000000001s)]
*  an inclination of predisposition towards a particular thing. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=743.96s)]

*  fuck around and have fun, right? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=755.0s)]

*  straight activity, then it gets into gay. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=759.0400000000001s)]

*  Do you like I wonder if that's something that happens when people [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=770.4s)]
*  get so much money and power that they're just their band or they're [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=773.2399999999999s)]

*  But then there's some people that I got a question for you. Yeah. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=985.96s)]
*  I listened to your President Trump interview. Yeah. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=989.2s)]
*  Why did you talk about this shit with him? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't think I think it was hard to talk about it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  Bernie Sanders. I could have. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=996.96s)]
*  Yeah, but the Romans were gay, right? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=998.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1002.08s)]
*  Well, I was just because I probably should have asked him [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1002.88s)]
*  if people get so powerful, do they then? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1005.84s)]
*  Yeah, just because at that point, anything's an option, you know? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1008.64s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1011.48s)]
*  I think there's things that lead people like. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1012.2s)]
*  Like if you want to push limits, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1015.24s)]
*  Right. Pushing limits. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1016.6800000000001s)]
*  If you think money can buy you anything. Right. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1017.52s)]
*  Right. And you want to push the limits and think, OK, I got money. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1019.84s)]
*  That gives me power so I can do whatever I want. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1022.48s)]
*  That's just going to backfire so hard, because if you're not like real, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1025.16s)]
*  the people that are, you know, you're messing with. Right. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1030.04s)]
*  They're going to be really. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1033.52s)]
*  It's just going to be a disaster. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1034.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about with the diddy thing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1035.88s)]
*  I think it's just like at a level of that, you can have anything [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1037.52s)]
*  that you get this power. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1041.92s)]
*  It's just kind of I mean, it's sad and it's scary to see, you know? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that's some of the crazy. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1046.4s)]
*  Yeah, you kind of wonder, like, when did it click? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1047.48s)]
*  When did it like fall over the cliff? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1049.76s)]
*  Right. When it went from, OK, let's hang and have some fun. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1052.32s)]
*  Have a good party to when it started getting weird. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1054.84s)]
*  Yeah. Like I'm taking videos of everybody and this and that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1056.72s)]
*  Do you think there'll be others people that will come out about this? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  Or do you think a lot of that's like myth, like Internet mythology? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  I have no idea. Yeah, I really don't. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1065.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Sorry. It's just like something that's been on kind of the topic of news. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1068.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. No, it's an interesting subject, right? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1071.12s)]
*  Yeah. Because you wonder like that. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1073.1599999999999s)]
*  I wonder because I mean, I've met the guy and I've seen him. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1074.96s)]
*  I met him one time, too. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1077.2s)]
*  But it's just like, how does it get that far? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1078.56s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and and and that kind of stuff is addictive to the once you do [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1081.4399999999998s)]
*  one crazy thing, then that becomes especially if you're trying to up yourself. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1086.0s)]
*  Right. You know, because I mean, you've gone out drinking. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1089.32s)]
*  I've gone out drinking with buddies. Right. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1091.6s)]
*  Oh, have another shot. Right. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1093.12s)]
*  I have another have another have another. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1094.4799999999998s)]
*  And that's what guys do. Right. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  But if it goes to the wrong direction, it could backfire. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1097.9599999999998s)]
*  And like it has in the paranoia of having to keep every. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1101.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, that would be a nightmare, man. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1105.12s)]
*  I'm I feel lucky I'm not living that way. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1106.52s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, to me, like the telltale sign is [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  if I can hurt people. Right. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1111.3999999999999s)]
*  He hit women. Right. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1113.32s)]
*  He dragged that one lady down the hall. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1115.24s)]
*  And yes, that tells you he's fucked up somewhere. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1117.6s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1120.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing to want to party. Right. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1121.0s)]
*  It's another thing like, OK, I'm throwing a big party. Right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1123.32s)]
*  But it's a whole other thing to physically abuse people. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1126.0s)]
*  That's just like, yeah, that's just. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1129.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, how do you not have your own awareness at that point? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1131.12s)]
*  But then I think things get, you know, when you get power [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1133.84s)]
*  and you get that much ability, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1136.56s)]
*  your own sense of self can probably get skewed pretty easy. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Something's fucked up, obviously. Yeah. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1143.28s)]
*  What are some of the side effects of being that people don't see [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  of being very wealthy? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1149.0s)]
*  Like, are there some negative things about it? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1151.48s)]
*  I mean, sorry. It's hard. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1153.4s)]
*  Yeah. You're lucky that I can tell. Right. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  You look so happy. It's hard for me to even know. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1157.48s)]
*  I mean, the side effects, people sue you. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1160.48s)]
*  OK. You're the deep pockets. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1162.2s)]
*  That's a good point, man. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1163.76s)]
*  I'm friends with John Leotard, Jimmy John. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  He had the Jimmy John's Sandwich Company. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1167.32s)]
*  And he said he one of the reasons that he sold the company [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1169.3999999999999s)]
*  was because he spent most of his time thinning off lawsuits [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1173.6s)]
*  and he wasn't even able to be like. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1176.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like I've been sued. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  Five times my whole life, right. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1181.24s)]
*  And four of them were because someone just trying to get money. Wow. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1183.3999999999999s)]
*  That's it. You know, and they're like, name multiple people in the lawsuits [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1189.96s)]
*  and they'll let the other people off the hook. Right. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1194.32s)]
*  They won't let me off the hook because I'm the deep pockets. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1198.04s)]
*  So that's kind of a bummer. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1201.28s)]
*  Then I bet you have to be a little bit more cautious about things then. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1202.32s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. So that's one thing. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1204.76s)]
*  So one thing people don't realize, you probably have to be extremely cautious. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1206.32s)]
*  Yeah. And then for your kids, right. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1209.1599999999999s)]
*  Because it's not their life, right. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1210.84s)]
*  There's just, you know, they they inherited us. Right. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1213.8799999999999s)]
*  And I mean, it's not necessarily bad, but it's not necessarily easy either. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1217.08s)]
*  Right. You know, have somebody who's, you know, well known as your dad [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1221.84s)]
*  to have everybody know you may not be rich yet, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1226.52s)]
*  but you're going to be right. Right. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1230.48s)]
*  You know, and so I know that puts a lot of pressure on my kids. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1232.1599999999999s)]
*  And so we have conversations. Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1234.8s)]
*  But at least you're able to communicate with them about that and have a. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1237.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, like I told all my kids, it's like, look, you fuck up. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1240.12s)]
*  Your friends fuck up. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  Your friends just fucked up and their parents get mad. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1245.24s)]
*  You fuck up. It's on the front page of the paper because you're my kid. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1247.36s)]
*  So you've got to be a little bit extra careful. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1250.44s)]
*  Is it hard to be like, you know, you're a celebrity and, you know, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1252.8400000000001s)]
*  and you may not think of yourself in that way or maybe you do. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1257.28s)]
*  I don't know. But no matter what, you're a recognizable person. Yeah. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1259.28s)]
*  Was it ever weird with your kids where you felt like [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1263.76s)]
*  my kids are never going to feel like I'm theirs because I'm so [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1268.16s)]
*  because I'm also in a way belong to other people? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1271.96s)]
*  Yeah, all the time. And that's all the time. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1274.72s)]
*  Because there's times like my son told me the other day, I'm like, OK, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1276.96s)]
*  I'll go out and get no dad. When you're there, everything changes. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1279.56s)]
*  I just want to be normal. Yeah. Right. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  And that was breaks my heart. Right. Yeah. I can imagine. Yeah. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1285.56s)]
*  But I understand, too. Right. I understand. Right. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1288.48s)]
*  And it happens with all my kids, you know, where it's just like, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1291.32s)]
*  there's a time for dad to be there. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1294.6s)]
*  And there's a time we don't want dad there, not because we don't want dad there, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  just because of the attention he's going to pull. Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1299.84s)]
*  Yeah. So that's another side effect of some things that people don't see. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1302.76s)]
*  Yeah. I'm just curious about it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  We were trying to get this therapist who works mostly with really wealthy people [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1308.72s)]
*  on to talk to learn more about that, because like when I was growing up, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1312.4s)]
*  I always looked at wealthy people like, fuck them, you know, let's bomb them. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1315.96s)]
*  Let's bomb them. OK. We didn't have any bombs. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1319.5200000000002s)]
*  We didn't have any bombs. But, you know, we was bomb them. OK. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1322.48s)]
*  Look, we were in this. We had to have a plan. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1326.92s)]
*  OK. Oh, my God. We had no strategy. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1328.88s)]
*  But we just we did. We keep playing video games. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1331.4s)]
*  But yeah, but in the back of your mind, you're playing GTA. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1334.88s)]
*  But we had like, yeah, but you it almost gave you an enemy when when [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1337.64s)]
*  when you were growing up poor, it gave you this like not an enemy, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1341.88s)]
*  but it gave you like a kind of well, I can relate. Right. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not like my family had anything. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1348.5200000000002s)]
*  My dad did upholstery on cars. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1350.24s)]
*  Neither one went to college, et cetera. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1351.8000000000002s)]
*  But no, I remember vividly like not knowing how I was going to be able [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1353.24s)]
*  to pay for school because I had to pay for my own school. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1357.8400000000001s)]
*  And listening on the radio is so crazy. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1359.92s)]
*  Listen on the radio about how these prisoners were going to get [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1363.8400000000001s)]
*  all the college education they needed. Right. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1367.24s)]
*  And I called into the radio station. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1369.32s)]
*  I'm like, I'm 16. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1371.12s)]
*  I don't have any idea how I'm going to pay for college. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1372.8s)]
*  And they're paying for prisoners. That's just wrong. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1374.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You're like, so now I got to commit a crime. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1377.96s)]
*  Yeah. Right. To go. Yeah. Put me in jail. Right. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1380.32s)]
*  That's one other conversation. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1382.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, what is something that you admire about each one of your children? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1384.76s)]

*  any other parents raising three teenagers, basically. Right. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1416.56s)]
*  Because those kids want to have their own identity. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1419.2s)]
*  They want to become themselves and find out who they are. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1421.44s)]
*  And, you know, we're trying not to be those hover parents, right. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1424.0s)]

*  I got none. Yeah. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1500.2s)]
*  I mean, you know now, too, right? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1501.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's times like yesterday, I was driving somewhere [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1503.36s)]
*  and I wanted to get out and walk. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1505.44s)]
*  It's like a cool street in town. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1506.8s)]
*  And I was like, man, I know if I get out and walk, it'll be fine. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1508.1599999999999s)]
*  But I just know that I will meet a bunch of people. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1511.32s)]
*  And then it's like it'll start to make me nervous or uncomfortable a little. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1513.24s)]
*  Because you don't know where it goes. Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1516.84s)]
*  Yeah. You're just like, so I think, yeah, sometimes stuff like that, isn't it? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1518.1599999999999s)]
*  I guess that's the biggest thing. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1521.72s)]
*  Yeah. Because like I was walking in Nashville yesterday. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1522.9199999999998s)]
*  Isn't that song right? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1525.2s)]
*  And walking in Memphis. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1526.72s)]
*  Memphis. Thank God. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1528.1599999999999s)]
*  It's yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1529.28s)]
*  Nashville is better. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1530.28s)]
*  I think so, too. Memphis is good. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1531.3999999999999s)]
*  But it's all right. Nashville is better. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1532.76s)]
*  But I was just walking down the street and I'm here. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1534.36s)]
*  It was dark. Right. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1536.52s)]
*  And I'm here. Cuban, Cuban. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1537.6s)]
*  I just keep on walking. Right. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1539.1599999999999s)]
*  It's just like no privacy whatsoever. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1540.76s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, it could be worse. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1542.6s)]
*  Yeah. That's a good point. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1545.68s)]
*  Yeah. No, there's yeah, I'm not complaining. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1546.52s)]
*  I'm just curious if they're like what like what's one of the biggest things. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1548.8s)]
*  Let me think about where we're at right now. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1553.32s)]
*  So we've talked about somehow you got started. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1554.84s)]
*  Let's have fun. This is not like any other interview I've done. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1557.96s)]
*  So I'm loving it. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1560.24s)]
*  No, man, because you're like all over. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1561.04s)]
*  Shit, whatever's, you know, stream of consciousness, which is cool. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1562.36s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1566.04s)]
*  Yeah. And this is a conversation, too. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1566.76s)]
*  And I think I like that about you. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1567.96s)]
*  You make this feel like a conversation. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1569.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Yeah. No. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1570.36s)]
*  How do you know like a good business idea when you hear it now? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1572.32s)]
*  And has that refined over the years from what you used to think might have been a good. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1575.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like when you're just getting started, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1578.56s)]
*  sometimes what you don't know is good. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1581.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. Because it doesn't hold you back. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1583.6s)]
*  So now, because I've been doing I've started so many businesses, invested in so many. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1585.32s)]
*  Like, I know what not to do, but that sometimes keeps me from [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1588.9199999999998s)]
*  investing in people who probably have the biggest upside. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1592.24s)]
*  Right. Because, you know, when I was getting started, I didn't know. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1594.9599999999998s)]
*  Fuck. Right. So it was just like you just got the. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1597.84s)]
*  Run through walls type attitude. Right. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1600.36s)]
*  Founder mode. And now like investing, I kind of look for that. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1602.6799999999998s)]
*  But I'm more conservative. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1607.1599999999999s)]
*  And how I invest. Right. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1611.0s)]
*  Because, you know, my next dollar isn't going to change my life. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1612.4799999999998s)]
*  And so it's more like, OK, just competition. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1616.36s)]
*  Can I get it right? Or can I help these people or can I help them grow this company? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1619.1599999999999s)]
*  Shark Tank. Right. It's just like not all those companies are going to be big. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1622.4399999999998s)]
*  But if I can help them turn, you know, reach their personal goals, that's a win. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1625.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1629.84s)]
*  When it comes to Shark Tank, are you going to miss doing it? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1631.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'll miss it some. Right. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1634.12s)]
*  But again, it goes back to my kids like we shoot two weeks in June, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1635.52s)]
*  two weeks in September, just finished, right. My last run. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1638.96s)]
*  And that's right when my kids are getting out of school. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1641.84s)]
*  Right. And right when they're going back to school and their birthdays. Right. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1644.52s)]
*  Yeah. It's like I miss my son's birthday for like the last five years. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1647.48s)]
*  Like, that's not cool. Yeah. You know. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1650.52s)]
*  And so now, you know, and plus now, like as teenagers, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1652.16s)]
*  they set the schedule. We don't. Right. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1656.16s)]
*  Used to be my wife and I'd be like, OK, we're going here, here, here. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1658.08s)]
*  When dad's done with Shark Tank. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1660.44s)]
*  Now they're like, no, like my daughter, you know, is a rower. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1661.76s)]

*  Shark Tank, what I would have taken in there. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1920.28s)]
*  Well, what made you decide to get into the podcasting rule? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1922.0s)]
*  I went on Joe Rogan. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1924.96s)]
*  Well, I done some podcasting and one day I went on Joe Rogan's show and he, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1925.76s)]
*  and on his, we just talked more as a long talk. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1931.6000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, Oh, maybe I could just do it by myself. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1935.0s)]
*  And so then I think I always wanted to have my own voice. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1939.6000000000001s)]
*  And so then I just started in my kitchen and I say that a lot, but I [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1942.24s)]
*  literally took my kitchen, my dinner table and just made it where the studio [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1945.92s)]
*  was and that became the studio. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1949.3200000000002s)]
*  So then I have to eat in the living room and stuff, but it was still like, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1951.8000000000002s)]

*  have a voice, I think when I was a kid. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1960.72s)]
*  And so, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1962.3600000000001s)]

*  get a studio. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1989.3999999999999s)]
*  And I was like, well, I want to keep that 500 bucks. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1990.8799999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1994.8s)]
*  But then he's like, no, you don't see it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1995.56s)]
*  He said, if you can do this next step and use that 500 bucks to get your [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=1997.1599999999999s)]
*  studio, then you're, it's going to do better. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2002.24s)]
*  And that was something that's really been a blessing because I don't, my [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2005.48s)]
*  mindset was just different. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2009.08s)]
*  You know, I had a more scarcity mindset and right, right. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2010.36s)]
*  Cause you needed the $500, right? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2012.6s)]
*  As opposed to grow the better, have it in my bank account. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2014.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2016.72s)]
*  Then use it as an investment. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2016.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2018.1200000000001s)]
*  And use it in investment. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2018.44s)]
*  And then once we did the first studio and then that kind of evolved from there. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2019.48s)]
*  Um, and you just kept on growing it on your own or did you bring in [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2024.08s)]
*  people to do the sales or? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2027.2s)]

*  Right. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2099.4s)]
*  Guys were just insanely smart and good. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2102.2000000000003s)]
*  So I got lucky, you know, but like helping them have some, yeah, I just got them [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2102.6800000000003s)]
*  started right there, like, like Tim, the pizza guy did for you, right? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2106.48s)]
*  Or Tom, the pizza guy, right? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2109.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2110.48s)]
*  And so like sometimes just making yourself available opens a lot of doors. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2110.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2116.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2116.52s)]
*  And it's helped me a ton. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2116.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2118.64s)]
*  Who were your mentors and then how do you differentiate between listening to [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2119.4s)]
*  mentors and trusting your instincts kind of? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2125.56s)]
*  I never had a mentor. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2127.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2128.6800000000003s)]
*  Not a mentor guy at all. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2129.08s)]
*  I always wanted to try to figure out myself. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2130.2000000000003s)]
*  I've always been like a super curious, like just somebody who loves to learn. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2132.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2135.08s)]
*  And so, I mean, you know, when I was getting into computers, I was reading [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2135.44s)]
*  the stupid computer manuals, right? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2139.04s)]
*  Software manuals, hardware. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2141.2000000000003s)]
*  I would sit there and read that shit. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2142.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2143.64s)]
*  And then I would try it and try it and learn and learn and learn. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2144.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2146.4s)]
*  And then once you get started, you realize whether it's business, software, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2146.7599999999998s)]
*  whatever, once you get that base, just it's like learning the podcasting business. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2149.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2153.3999999999996s)]
*  Once you get that base of the basics you're supposed to do coming up with new [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2153.6s)]
*  shit isn't that hard, right? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2156.64s)]
*  It's just about your creativity. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2159.2s)]
*  And so I was always just, I'm going to learn it myself, learn it myself. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2159.56s)]
*  Never had a mentor. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2163.3199999999997s)]
*  And then people are like, will you be my mentor? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, I'm still going, right? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2166.48s)]
*  I don't have time to be someone else. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2168.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2169.2s)]
*  Maybe that's not fair, but that's where I'm at. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  But not if you're still going, you know, I mean, right now you're mentoring your [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2172.44s)]
*  family. You've already said that you've chosen to take that extra time. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2175.56s)]
*  That's more important. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2178.2s)]
*  It is, especially now. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2179.0s)]
*  If I can get them to listen. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2180.48s)]
*  It's crazy, dude, how your own kids, Mark, you've been in the kitchen. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2182.92s)]

*  And they're like, let me breathe. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2188.08s)]
*  Mark. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2189.88s)]
*  I'd be like, you want me to help you with this business idea or, you know, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2191.4s)]
*  your project at school? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2193.92s)]
*  No, no. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2195.16s)]

*  So I got, I didn't get to know him, but I was, um, helped him with something [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2550.2s)]
*  or tried to help him. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2555.44s)]
*  And so I had his number and I texted him a couple of times, like he had a kid [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2556.6s)]
*  and I'm like, congrats on your 97th kid. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2560.48s)]
*  And he texts me back Mars, Mars needs kids, right? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2562.44s)]
*  Mars needs people. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2565.04s)]
*  And I'm like, that's funny as shit. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2566.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2567.28s)]
*  And so one day I had a Tesla and I said something about it and he just sends [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2568.04s)]
*  me a text with the article saying, fuck you. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2571.52s)]

*  Fuck you. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2580.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2580.88s)]
*  So that's a text with the article that what? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2581.4s)]
*  That I said something that wasn't completely totally positive about Tesla. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2583.16s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2587.52s)]
*  So that's what, that's what the article was about. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2587.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2589.2799999999997s)]
*  So he was just like, fuck you. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2589.52s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2591.7999999999997s)]
*  And then it was nothing, you know, no big deal. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2592.84s)]
*  I don't care one way or the other. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2594.48s)]
*  And then we buy his Twitter, right. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2595.84s)]
*  And then he starts getting real political, right. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2597.56s)]
*  And so not a lot of people are going to stand up to him and I'm like, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2599.72s)]
*  fucking, I don't care. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2603.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2604.4s)]
*  So he's called me racist. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2604.88s)]
*  He's called me, you know, poop emoji multiple times. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2606.3199999999997s)]
*  He calls me all these names. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2609.44s)]
*  And so like that, to me, that just gives me license to fuck with them even more. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2610.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2615.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't care if he calls me names. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2615.52s)]
*  I don't give a shit what he thinks. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2616.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2617.6s)]
*  But it's still fun, right? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2618.04s)]
*  You know, just to hit them with the LOLs or whatever. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2620.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2622.8399999999997s)]
*  Cause at that point you're just kind of having a good time. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2623.04s)]
*  And Twitter is a strange place where you can just kind of say whatever it kind of [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2624.68s)]
*  exists, it kind of doesn't the news. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2629.3199999999997s)]
*  Like Twitter is a, it's just such a bizarre place. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2631.52s)]
*  I wish they would take a lot of the pornography off of their [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2636.4s)]
*  hardcore, right? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2638.6s)]
*  How'd they get away with all that shit? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2639.92s)]
*  Because you only have to be 13 to go on there. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2641.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2643.4s)]
*  You know, you talked about some of the shit we were talking earlier. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2644.96s)]
*  That's where the shit just shows up in your face all the time. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2647.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2649.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2649.92s)]
*  That, that kind of stuff is, I think, yeah, I wish it that we didn't have that. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, and yeah, and I think, yeah, and he's, yeah, he's always on there, but yeah, I [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2655.0s)]
*  think he, and he might still be high off the fact that he bought it, you know, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2659.7200000000003s)]
*  that he owns it. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2662.32s)]
*  Look, you gotta give him tons of credit, right? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2663.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2664.56s)]
*  SpaceX, you know, Starlink, Tesla, the shit dudes, like the entrepreneur of our [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2665.0s)]
*  generation, right? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2671.32s)]
*  There's like nobody close, you know, at least in the two thousands. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2672.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2674.84s)]
*  And so I have total respect for him as an entrepreneur, but his skin is so thin. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2675.52s)]
*  How can you not fuck with them? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2680.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2681.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2682.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2683.2400000000002s)]
*  I think, well, yeah, I mean, it's, I think it's, I mean, Twitter is definitely a [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2683.48s)]
*  place where is it real? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2686.7200000000003s)]
*  Is it not real? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2689.04s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2690.12s)]
*  It's always been interesting. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2691.4s)]
*  Um, I feel, I kind of, I was happy that he bought it though. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2692.8s)]
*  I mean, I feel like he kind of rescued it because I feel like a lot of, a lot of [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2696.84s)]
*  like the mainstream media and like the social media platforms, they seem all [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2701.2s)]
*  pretty left leaning, right? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2704.68s)]
*  Used to be for sure. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2707.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2708.28s)]
*  But now like the biggest platforms are Fox news, daily wire, the big names, like [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2708.68s)]
*  named the big left leaning, um, anchors or whatever, who are the, who are the, the [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2714.88s)]
*  most left leaning big, um, celebrities in media today. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2720.36s)]
*  Well, I guess you'd probably have like, um, Don Lemon, I guess. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2726.0800000000004s)]
*  He got fired. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2730.1200000000003s)]
*  He did. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2730.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2731.4s)]
*  He got fired from CNN. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2731.8s)]
*  He's gone, right? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2732.96s)]
*  He ain't got shit going on. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2734.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2735.28s)]
*  Um, when life gives you Don Lemon, let him go. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2736.7200000000003s)]
*  You get the point, right? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2742.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2743.5600000000004s)]
*  There's no big names. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2743.92s)]
*  I think, but CNN, I think a lot of the mainstream media has been [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2744.7200000000003s)]
*  notoriously kind of left leaning. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2748.2000000000003s)]
*  I think it seems like they're anti. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2749.72s)]
*  I mean, especially like during the first time that Trump was running, like the only [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2752.7999999999997s)]
*  people that even the late night hosts would make fun of were basically like kind [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2756.8399999999997s)]
*  of poor whites, it seemed like. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2759.7599999999998s)]
*  For sure. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2761.3599999999997s)]
*  That was wrong. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2761.68s)]
*  It got like, if you were like conservative or Christian, I feel like those people [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2762.3999999999996s)]
*  get the brunt of shit a lot of times. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2766.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2768.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm not going to argue with that. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2768.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2769.56s)]
*  But I guess my point is in 2016, it was different, right? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2769.9199999999996s)]
*  TV was still up here, right? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2774.08s)]
*  Getting nine, 10 million viewers a night for a TV show was okay. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2776.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2780.0s)]
*  And so whoever was on the news then or CNN, they were getting millions of people. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2780.72s)]
*  Now the only platforms getting a lot of viewers are like Fox news is the biggest [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2786.7599999999998s)]
*  MSNBC gets some like a Rachel Maddow you could say, but for every Rachel Maddow, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2791.24s)]
*  you know, there's Sean Hannity, there's Laura Ingraham, there's, you know, all [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2795.56s)]
*  the, all the hosts, and then you've got Ben Shapiro's, you've got all these right [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2800.04s)]
*  you know, the Tucker Carlson's. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2804.48s)]
*  And so the bigger stars now and the bigger media presence is on the right. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2806.16s)]
*  And so I think what's happened on Twitter now, since Elon has pushed it to the [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2810.7999999999997s)]

*  In 2016, if you went on and, and talked about Trump positively, you would get shit on. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2817.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, you couldn't say anything. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2822.3199999999997s)]
*  If you were even a conservative, you couldn't even ask a question. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2823.3999999999996s)]
*  You would get shit on, right? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2825.8799999999997s)]
*  It was very scary. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2826.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2827.72s)]
*  So it was left-leading, but now it's exact opposite. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2827.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2831.12s)]
*  If when I say stuff about Harris, you can just look at my, my ref, my mentions, my [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2831.56s)]
*  replies, and I'm just getting destroyed. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2836.2s)]
*  I'm a communist. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2838.32s)]
*  You're a fucking Jew. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2839.64s)]
*  Go back to hell. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2840.76s)]
*  This is this, this is that. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2841.84s)]
*  Well Jews aren't from hell. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2843.16s)]
*  That's crazy dude. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2843.84s)]
*  Well no, but that's what they, no, it's all crazy. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2844.36s)]
*  But at least look at the history, you know what I'm saying? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2845.96s)]
*  Like, you know, look at a map. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2847.16s)]
*  No, it was insane. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2848.4s)]
*  The anti-Semitism on that place. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2848.8s)]
*  Maybe it's just pointed at me, right? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2850.32s)]
*  But I know Ben Shapiro, I looked at his replies cause I'm just curious, right? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2852.2400000000002s)]
*  So point being that, I think it's flip-flopped. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2855.48s)]
*  You do. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2858.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2858.76s)]
*  And I think now, I mean, look, you had president Trump on here coming on here, saying [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2859.04s)]
*  his piece, right? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2863.56s)]
*  And we would have Kamala on. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2864.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2865.68s)]
*  And I'll put in a good word for you too. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2866.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2867.96s)]
*  You know? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2868.24s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2868.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2869.2s)]
*  I think it would just be interesting to talk to her. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2869.36s)]
*  No, she's smart. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2871.36s)]
*  She's fine. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2872.04s)]
*  She's easy going, right? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2872.52s)]
*  Laughs a lot, but you know, she's, she's chill. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2874.04s)]
*  Um, but I think the whole thing is just flip-flopped and I think it's harder on [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2876.6s)]
*  Twitter in particular, it's harder to be, um, in support of Harris. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2881.24s)]
*  Like I'm not a liberal, right? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2885.56s)]
*  I mean, socially, I probably am physically. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2886.92s)]
*  I'm conservative and I'm an independent. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2889.12s)]
*  I don't belong to either party. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2891.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't give a shit about either party, you know, but I'm a Harris fan because I'm [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2892.2400000000002s)]
*  not, you know, I like her policies. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2896.04s)]
*  I've had some influence in her policies and I'm not a Trump fan at all. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2897.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2900.88s)]
*  Used to be, but they kind of grew out of it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2901.2000000000003s)]
*  Have you, um, yeah, what do you think made you grow? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2903.0s)]
*  I like that's interesting term. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2905.76s)]
*  Like grew out of it. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2907.28s)]
*  You know, I would once I came out saying I was for him, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2908.44s)]
*  Oh, you, you had come out and said that? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2913.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2915.04s)]
*  I said it was the best thing that happened to politics because he wasn't a typical [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2915.32s)]
*  candidate. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2918.1600000000003s)]
*  Now I didn't think he had a chance. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2918.8s)]
*  That's how I felt. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2919.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2920.48s)]
*  Cause I would have elected a fucking donut in there if it wasn't a politician. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2920.84s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2924.8s)]
*  That's like one of my buddies in Texas. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2925.36s)]
*  I'm like, why are you voting for Trump? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2926.7200000000003s)]
*  He goes, Mark, I've been voting for politicians my entire life. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2928.0s)]
*  You know what they've done for me? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2930.6800000000003s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2931.96s)]
*  You know, the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2932.6800000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2936.0400000000004s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, Dan, I get that. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2936.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2937.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2937.96s)]
*  But as I would talk to them and it's funny because, um, in my memory, things [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2938.32s)]
*  that came up right just this morning, I was looking at it and it was like, he [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2943.36s)]
*  sent me a text. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2947.08s)]
*  I'd done a CNN interview. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2948.2000000000003s)]
*  Donald? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2949.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2950.0s)]
*  Donald said, um, well, what he would do is he would write it and then somebody [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2950.2400000000002s)]
*  would scan it and then they'd email it to me. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2953.76s)]
*  Um, and so he sent me what happened. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2956.04s)]
*  Cause he saw a CNN interview where I criticized them. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2958.76s)]
*  And I literally, I told him, I'm like, you got to start learning the issues, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2961.08s)]
*  right? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2965.08s)]
*  You can't just talk, you know, at some point, all these things are important. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2965.4s)]
*  And if you're going to be president and you've got a chance to win, then you've [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2969.36s)]
*  got to learn this stuff. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2973.32s)]
*  And I just never felt he'd made an effort to learn anything, not just that, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2974.48s)]
*  but anything. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2978.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2978.6400000000003s)]
*  And so whenever you try to get into a conversation about details, it never [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2979.2400000000002s)]
*  worked. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2984.6000000000004s)]
*  Now, all that said, even though I don't think he'd make a good president, I [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2985.1600000000003s)]
*  don't think it was a good president before when he did become president, when [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2987.6400000000003s)]
*  he asked me to come help on during COVID, right? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2990.8s)]
*  When he asked me to help about healthcare, I showed up, right? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2993.36s)]
*  Because country over party, right? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2996.4s)]
*  And I would do it again if he wins, but I hope he doesn't. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=2998.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3000.44s)]
*  Have you donated to the Om Harris campaign? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3001.3599999999997s)]
*  No, I haven't given money to any candidate pack, anything, um, politics [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3003.48s)]
*  related to either party, um, since 2001. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3009.8399999999997s)]
*  And that was like, I don't even know to Zoe Loughlin. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3013.3199999999997s)]
*  I remember why I gave her money, right? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3015.4399999999996s)]
*  That's when I had broadcast.com. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3017.16s)]
*  So I kind of make a point not to give money so that either you, if I talk to [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3019.08s)]
*  you, either you like my ideas or you don't, and it's not about me buying, you [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3022.9599999999996s)]

*  everybody, all politicians learn from Donald Trump and how he won because, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3246.96s)]

*  Right. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3253.2400000000002s)]
*  I see it in the Harris campaign. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3253.44s)]
*  I see it in Kamala Harris, right? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3254.88s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump took over the Republican party. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3256.88s)]
*  It was no longer the Republican party. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3259.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3261.68s)]
*  Great point. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3261.92s)]
*  I never really thought about that. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3262.56s)]
*  He took over, right? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3263.48s)]
*  It's like whatever he wants. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3264.8s)]
*  He didn't want to debate in the Republican primary. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3266.04s)]
*  So be it. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3269.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3270.08s)]
*  They let them not debate. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3270.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3271.6s)]
*  He's, you know, who knows what would happen against VEC or Nikki Haley or whatever. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3272.0s)]
*  It might've been, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3276.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3277.36s)]
*  They didn't have to debate this year. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3277.6s)]
*  Huh? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3278.6s)]
*  No, they wanted to. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3278.88s)]
*  The other ones did. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3279.68s)]
*  He just didn't participate. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3280.52s)]
*  And so he just didn't step up and say, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3282.1600000000003s)]
*  okay, I'm going to kick your ass. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3283.84s)]
*  I'm happy to debate anybody. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3285.0s)]
*  He said, no, I'm not going to debate his choice. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3286.44s)]
*  But the point being he controls the Republican party. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3288.6000000000004s)]
*  I think that's what's happening with them. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3291.92s)]
*  That wasn't super democratic probably. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3293.36s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3295.0s)]
*  It was, but it's his choice, right? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3295.88s)]
*  The Republican party is a private entity. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3297.0800000000004s)]
*  He gets to do the way and he runs it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3299.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3301.28s)]
*  But he shouldn't, but in their overall body that would say that you guys have to have [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3301.92s)]
*  this nobody, the Republicans get to pick their candidate the way they want to. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3306.1200000000003s)]
*  And the Democrats get to pick their candidate the way they want to. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3310.08s)]
*  So all this shit about, well, you know, Nikki, I mean, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3313.0s)]
*  Nikki, Kamala Harris didn't get a single vote. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3315.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3318.08s)]
*  Don't matter. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3318.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3319.36s)]
*  And tell you what kind of dweeb I am. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3319.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3321.6400000000003s)]
*  And nerd, like I literally looked up the bylaws of the Democratic National [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3322.6400000000003s)]
*  Convention and the Republican National Convention. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3327.1200000000003s)]
*  And they both say, we basically, in a nutshell, we get to pick the candidates the [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3329.6000000000004s)]
*  way we want to pick the candidates. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3333.28s)]
*  Period. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3334.76s)]
*  End of story. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3335.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3335.56s)]
*  So either so, because kind of on both sides, it seems like the, that, that, that [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3335.88s)]
*  Kamala and Donald have just been put in. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3341.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3344.56s)]
*  So neither one of them kind of practice like, but it don't matter. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3345.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3347.84s)]
*  What do they care about power to your point earlier? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3348.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3350.08s)]
*  What's the Democrat party want power? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3350.76s)]
*  What's the Republican party want power? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3352.8s)]
*  Now who's in charge of those, each of those businesses, the parties, Donald's in [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3355.48s)]
*  charge. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3359.36s)]
*  And the thing I was saying about learning from Donald now, Kamala is like, I'm [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3359.76s)]
*  taking over the Democratic party. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3363.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3365.6400000000003s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3366.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3367.32s)]
*  So it used to be like in 2016, people thought, well, you know, all the traditional [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3367.6000000000004s)]
*  Republicans, the Mitt Romney's or whoever, they're really going to run the show. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3371.88s)]
*  And that was like, fuck that. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3375.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3376.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm doing it my own way. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3376.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3378.2000000000003s)]
*  And so Nikki, Kamala has learned all that stuff now and she's doing it the same way. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3378.6000000000004s)]
*  So she's not like, okay, this is what Bernie wants. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3383.5600000000004s)]
*  She doesn't give a fuck what Bernie wants. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3385.6000000000004s)]
*  She, you know, this is what Elizabeth Warren wants. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3387.1600000000003s)]
*  She doesn't give a fuck what Elizabeth Warren wants. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3388.96s)]
*  She wants to know what's best for the country. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3390.96s)]
*  And so then are people like, well, why was she not this way in California? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3392.96s)]
*  Because running California, being a Senator in California is a completely different job [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3396.5200000000004s)]
*  than trying to be the president. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3400.92s)]
*  You know, just like running real estate is a completely different job than trying to [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3403.1200000000003s)]
*  be the president. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3405.88s)]
*  So I think she's trying to come to center because, and she's trying to be the exact [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3406.48s)]
*  opposite of Trump, but she has captured the Democratic party. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3410.96s)]
*  Like when I talk to them, it's not like, okay, this is what the Democrats want. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3414.88s)]
*  It's like, okay, what's best for the country and how do we implement that and how do we [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3419.44s)]
*  convey that so she can win? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3423.7599999999998s)]
*  Now, some people might argue Bernie Sanders really is pulling the strings, but he [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3425.56s)]
*  ain't right. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3429.32s)]
*  Just like, he didn't seem like that when I spoke with him, he seemed like, I didn't [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3430.4s)]
*  even know how vested he was in her B and D candidate. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3433.04s)]
*  You know, he's not right. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3436.8s)]
*  That's the whole point, right? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3438.2s)]
*  It seemed like, you know, whatever, right? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3439.52s)]
*  Because she's in the center. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3441.44s)]
*  So you're saying you believe that she's doing her own thing. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3443.08s)]
*  She's definitely doing her own thing. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3445.12s)]
*  Like she says, here's my core values, right? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3446.7599999999998s)]
*  I want taxes to be fair. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3449.8s)]
*  I want to lower taxes for the middle class, right? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3451.92s)]
*  I want to bring people up and make sure that they have opportunities, right? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3454.92s)]
*  I want to try to do what I can to continue to reduce inflation and costs. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3460.0s)]
*  And I don't want to be negative. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3464.48s)]
*  You know, whereas Donald is negative a lot, right? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3466.24s)]
*  And so you hear talking about joyous and uplifting and all that stuff. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3469.84s)]
*  Oh, I see. I see. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3473.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3474.4s)]
*  Because that's and I agree with this. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3474.7599999999998s)]
*  That's what's going to bring people together. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3476.56s)]
*  You can't say I hate Taylor Swift, right? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3478.3999999999996s)]
*  And say I'm bringing people together, right? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3480.72s)]
*  You can't say all the Haitians are bad, right? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3482.2799999999997s)]
*  Legal or illegal, right? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3485.08s)]
*  And throw all the legal immigrants under the bus like he's done. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3486.6s)]
*  And she's you haven't heard her criticize like, like Hillary Clinton fucked up, right? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3489.9599999999996s)]
*  Because you nailed it, right? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3494.16s)]
*  She was talking shit, the deplorables and all that. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3495.3199999999997s)]
*  They're stupid for that's not Kamala at all. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3497.7599999999998s)]
*  She's like, all right, we're going to bring people together. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3500.08s)]
*  I'm going to be joyous. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3502.6s)]
*  I'm going to be uplifting. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3503.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3504.7999999999997s)]
*  See that now I understand a little bit more of her campaign then. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3505.12s)]
*  But do you think it's weird that she doesn't do a lot of interviews and stuff [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3508.08s)]
*  that she doesn't get out there? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3510.96s)]
*  Great question. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3512.6s)]
*  OK, so. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3513.24s)]
*  When she came in, right, and got nominated, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3515.44s)]
*  because you kind of don't know who she is, that's like you here, you see. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3517.72s)]
*  So then you start to just believe clips because it seems like you don't get a breath. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3520.52s)]
*  So let's so now that comes down this great question, right? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3526.3199999999997s)]
*  So because I asked the same question, and here's what they said to me. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3529.24s)]
*  They go, Mark, there's probably one percent of the electric electric [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3531.72s)]
*  of the electorate is high information. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3536.52s)]
*  So electorate say what it is. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3539.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3541.4s)]
*  So one percent of the electorate, people who are voting. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3541.6s)]
*  OK, so one percent of people who are voting are high information. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3544.08s)]
*  So people are going to go really look in depth like you and I might write. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3546.8s)]
*  Wow. Right. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3549.2400000000002s)]
*  Ninety nine percent. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3550.2400000000002s)]
*  They don't really know her. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3551.48s)]
*  Right. And so if you look, when she came in, she had horrible approval ratings. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3552.76s)]
*  She had horrible favorability ratings. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3556.6s)]
*  People didn't know who she is. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3558.44s)]
*  And so what she's doing, she's taking a page from the Trump pay playbook. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3559.88s)]
*  What did Trump do in 2016? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3563.1200000000003s)]
*  He did all those rallies all the time in front of 10, 15, 20. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3565.1200000000003s)]
*  That's exactly what she's doing. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3569.76s)]
*  Right. She's going everywhere and doing rally because that's how you get the maximum [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3571.4s)]
*  number of people without having anybody interpret it for her like media might do. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3574.84s)]
*  But the the reason she keeps on doing it, it's working. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3579.76s)]
*  Right. She went from having really bad favorability is no one knew to the exact opposite. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3584.32s)]
*  She went from being further behind than Biden because people didn't know actually [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3588.96s)]
*  potentially least break even if not leading in some cases. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3593.32s)]
*  It's working. So why does he just turn around? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3596.6s)]
*  And she's done some friendly interviews like Oprah and the National Association of [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3599.08s)]
*  Black Journalists, and she'll continue to do some stuff. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3602.52s)]
*  But you do what works. Right. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3605.12s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. I mean, I think. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3607.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just wish to. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3609.16s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like you'd want to get to know her a little bit better, you know, just [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3610.32s)]
*  to learn a little bit more about what you want to know about her. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3614.6s)]
*  Well, don't you question? I guess for me, I always want to know what somebody's really [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3617.7200000000003s)]
*  like. Yeah. You know, I mean, at least get it like to just to try to get an idea of [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3620.52s)]
*  that. And then also, like. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3624.76s)]
*  I think I can understand why a lot of people vote for Trump, you know, because, you [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3628.2000000000003s)]
*  know, he's had a history of being involved in a lot of shady business. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3633.36s)]
*  Right. And that's why they vote for him. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3636.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, because America has become what it feels like to a regular person. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3638.96s)]
*  It feels like I am a I am a part I am [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3643.8s)]
*  just a peon in a bigger, shady business. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3649.1600000000003s)]
*  It feels like that's interesting. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3652.6800000000003s)]
*  That's really, really interesting. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3654.28s)]
*  Yes. So then it feels like like, yeah, our water is dirty. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3655.6000000000004s)]
*  There are kids that are in. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3659.84s)]
*  We're you know, parents are boiling their own water now at home because they feel like [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3661.5600000000004s)]
*  that water is not safe and it's causing kids to have autism. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3666.0400000000004s)]
*  Our our our you know, we're our drugs. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3669.28s)]
*  People have to spend all their money on drugs like. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3673.48s)]
*  Well, I'm fixing that. So I'll get to that. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3676.92s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get to that. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3678.64s)]
*  But like, yeah, one of the largest causes of bankruptcy is medical debt in this country. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3680.12s)]
*  There's a huge shell game insurance scam going on. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3683.84s)]
*  It's horrible. It's worse than you think. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3686.7200000000003s)]
*  Hospitals and no idea how bad insurance providers and and big business. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3687.64s)]
*  It's just. But just look at that. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3693.32s)]
*  Right. Those shady things you mentioned. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3694.52s)]
*  He tried to fix. I literally went to the White House to talk about health care and the [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3696.84s)]
*  shit I'm doing. And he wanted to talk about how we save thirty five billion dollars on [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3700.24s)]
*  Boeing, Boeing aircrafts. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3704.6s)]
*  Right. Don't we couldn't have a conversation about it at all. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3707.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And maybe some of that stuff is evolving with him. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3710.16s)]
*  I don't know. You know, I don't. But but I think my point was that it's gotten to the [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3712.8399999999997s)]
*  point where you everything seems like such a shady business that I want somebody [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3717.6s)]
*  who is shady. No, I want somebody in there who can do shady business. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3723.12s)]
*  Well, that is a guy who does shady business. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3726.88s)]
*  Well, but that's but I think that's how a lot of people think. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3729.28s)]
*  Like, really, this whole thing is fucking me so much that at least he's my criminal. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3732.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me. He's my criminal. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3738.36s)]
*  He is a criminal. He's my criminal. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3740.8s)]
*  He's my criminal. Right. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3742.8s)]
*  Yeah. Or but yeah, because they feel like this other thing is such a it's so mobster that you [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3743.8s)]
*  need a mobster. That's what I'm saying. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3749.92s)]
*  I mean, that's the best description or reason I've heard of anybody wanted to vote for [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3751.9599999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump. Literally the best. Right. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3756.3999999999996s)]
*  Because you're right. Right. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3758.2799999999997s)]
*  If everything is that shady, then and he certainly I mean, he's ripped off. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3759.7599999999998s)]

*  He like Barbara Carcron. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3773.12s)]
*  She said something about this from Shark Tank. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3774.52s)]
*  Right. She he hired her or asked her to sell her a car. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3776.6s)]
*  To sell a bunch of condos in a new building that he put up. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3781.44s)]
*  And she did. She sold everything she asked. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3784.44s)]
*  He offered her four million dollars. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3786.8399999999997s)]
*  He wouldn't pay her. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3788.8399999999997s)]
*  She had to sue him just to get her money. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3790.52s)]
*  But how does somebody benefit by behaving like that? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3792.88s)]
*  Like as a when that's the only way you know. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3795.3599999999997s)]

*  Well, she likes him as a salesperson, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3814.48s)]
*  but down in there it talks about how he ripped her off. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3816.08s)]
*  How do you know Trump University, Trump Foundation, Trump Soho. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3820.3199999999997s)]
*  Just example after example, where he ripped off hard working Americans again and again and again. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3825.6s)]
*  And to think all of a sudden he just changed who he is. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3831.64s)]
*  Just not the case. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3834.44s)]
*  Like, look what he's doing fucking now. Right. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3835.92s)]
*  A mint silver coin. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3838.32s)]
*  If you're OK, if you're a billionaire, right, all of a sudden you just made a billion dollars. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3839.76s)]
*  You took your company public. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3844.28s)]
*  You put a billion dollars in the bank. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3845.44s)]
*  Are you going to be selling silver medallion coins? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3847.44s)]
*  What do they look like? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3850.96s)]
*  Does it matter? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3852.76s)]

*  They sell commemorative everything, don't they? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3861.76s)]
*  Yeah, but this is supposed to be a guy running for president, right? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3863.1600000000003s)]
*  And so he's selling commemorative coins. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3865.76s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  He's selling sneakers. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3868.84s)]
*  Gangster, bro. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3870.16s)]
*  But why? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3871.6s)]
*  If you're rich selling sneakers, right? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3872.44s)]
*  Because Donald also has a, you know, he has a very. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3874.72s)]
*  Look at this shit. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3879.28s)]
*  Those fucking things are hype as fuck, dude. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3880.08s)]
*  And I wish I could be honest, just because they're pretty tough. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3882.36s)]
*  I mean, they're ridiculous, but they're tough. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3885.0s)]
*  But I think he's got to, you know, he loves being Donald Trump. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3886.84s)]
*  Yes, he does. Undeniably. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3890.64s)]
*  And I don't blame him for that. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3892.0s)]
*  More power to him. I love your life. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3893.24s)]
*  Right. Enjoy every minute. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3894.96s)]
*  I hope he enjoys every minute of his life. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3896.32s)]
*  Right. I got nothing against. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3898.1600000000003s)]
*  I like the guy. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3899.6800000000003s)]
*  If he was here and we were just talking shit. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3900.84s)]
*  Yeah. I get along great with him. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3902.48s)]
*  Right. But that's different than wanting him to be president in the United States again. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3903.88s)]
*  Right. Totally different. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3907.28s)]
*  And I think you need somebody you can trust. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3908.7200000000003s)]
*  Now, is Kamala perfect? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3911.0800000000004s)]
*  No. Right. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3912.56s)]
*  Do I agree with everything she's going to do or says? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3913.48s)]
*  No. Right. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3915.6000000000004s)]
*  But I think you can trust her. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3916.44s)]
*  Right. And that's the difference. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3917.96s)]
*  And if you want to. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3919.04s)]
*  I don't think we need to keep things in gangster mode. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3921.04s)]
*  I don't know. That's why she's talks to me. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3924.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. I mean, that sounds stupid. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3925.52s)]
*  Right. But like fixing health care. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3927.0s)]
*  Right. She's not saying, OK, this lobbyist or that love. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3928.88s)]
*  She's like, how do we fix it? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3932.32s)]
*  Right. What do we do to make it to save people money? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3933.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, that's the difference. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3937.48s)]
*  Right. And I understand completely if you think everything's gangster, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3939.28s)]
*  the deep state and all this shit. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3942.8s)]
*  But like to me, that's just playing the victim. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3944.36s)]
*  You know, even by believing that sort of mentality, that when he does it, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3947.48s)]
*  right, when he says they're out, you know, it's the deep state. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3951.28s)]
*  He was fucking president of the United States, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3954.3199999999997s)]
*  the most powerful man in the world. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3955.88s)]
*  And what did he do to stop the deep state? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3957.6s)]
*  Now he just stopped talking about it. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3959.68s)]
*  He doesn't talk about the deep state anymore. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3960.96s)]
*  That's supposedly the ultimate gangster shit. Right. Yeah. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3962.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, if it's gangster and fucked up the way you say [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3966.08s)]
*  and maybe it is, right, maybe I just miss it. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3970.08s)]
*  It feels like it. No, and I'm not saying it's not right. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3972.16s)]
*  Maybe I just don't see it. Right. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3974.4s)]
*  Maybe I've got it too good and I don't see the shit. Right. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3976.04s)]
*  But I mean, it ain't going to get un gangster. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3979.16s)]
*  It's not going to get better. Right. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3983.64s)]
*  Put in a gangster. Right. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3985.08s)]
*  And if you put somebody who's a gangster and Tony Soprano style [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3986.68s)]
*  that only worries about loyalty, if you have an idea, he ain't listening. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3990.52s)]
*  He's doing it his way, where I think with her, she'll listen. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3995.7200000000003s)]
*  One interesting thing that he did. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=3999.44s)]
*  Well, I wonder how much would be different [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4003.6s)]
*  from the first time that he had the experience to be president to [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4005.36s)]
*  because sometimes you do something and you learn. Right. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4009.48s)]
*  The question is, does he become more gangster or more legit? Right. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4012.12s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4016.44s)]
*  I don't know. It's a good question. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4020.64s)]
*  I think that's the thing. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4022.56s)]
*  I wish I knew a little bit more about how he thinks and is, you know, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4024.12s)]
*  and that's the toughest thing is being a regular voter. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4029.2400000000002s)]
*  It's so hard to get to know how somebody. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4031.16s)]
*  But that's the exact same thing you said about Kamala, right? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4032.96s)]
*  Really is, you know, right? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4034.76s)]
*  Because when he looked again, I don't hate him. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4036.04s)]
*  I really don't hate anybody. Yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4040.08s)]
*  Right. I respect him. Right. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4041.6s)]
*  I just don't agree with him. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4043.56s)]
*  And I don't think he'd be a good president. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4044.7599999999998s)]
*  But when he came on here, right, I listened to the interview. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4046.56s)]
*  He talked pretty much other than your talk about his brother [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4049.96s)]
*  and what happened there, which was really cool. Right. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4053.56s)]
*  You know, you deserve a lot of credit. He deserves a lot of credit. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4055.64s)]
*  But yeah, I wish he would have talked a little more about it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4057.96s)]
*  You know, I think it's hard to get into some of his like an emotional side [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4059.96s)]
*  with him some. Yeah. You know, and I wish that it was maybe a little more possible. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4063.68s)]
*  But, you know, he's also, you know, he's he's a, you know, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4067.7999999999997s)]
*  he's an older guy, senior citizen. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4071.36s)]
*  And it's hard. Yeah, it's harder for that. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4072.76s)]
*  And I don't know him. You know. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4074.32s)]
*  But but you know, what I was going to say is he didn't really get into any details [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4076.1200000000003s)]
*  about anything other than the personal stuff with his brother. Right. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4079.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, in your stuff. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4083.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think he wants to, you know, he wants I think there's just things [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4084.7200000000003s)]
*  people want to feel. They want to feel safe. Right. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4087.44s)]
*  So you want to you want different things that are that are happening at the border. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4089.1600000000003s)]
*  Like we had a couple of border patrol agents on. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4093.4s)]
*  And they were saying that that a lot of the problems, it's not they used to. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4095.76s)]
*  They use of like usual, like Mexican migration that comes up to help with [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4100.32s)]
*  farming and stuff like that. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4103.92s)]
*  And then it's just gotten out of control. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4105.16s)]
*  And then now it's gotten really out of control. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4107.24s)]
*  So I think his like him saying that we want to close out or make it be like [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4110.16s)]
*  appropriate ways that that affects people's safety. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4114.679999999999s)]
*  No, I agree. Right. Everybody wants safety. Right. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4117.84s)]
*  And I think Biden fucked up. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4119.84s)]
*  No question about it. He waited too long to do anything about it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4121.759999999999s)]
*  Now, if you look at what's going on now, they're at the same. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4125.2s)]
*  The border crossings are at the same level they were under Trump. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4127.68s)]
*  Right. So they've they've come way down. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4131.6s)]
*  And she has already said she wants to sign the border bill that the Republicans put out there. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4134.160000000001s)]
*  Right. Not build a wall, but shut it down even further, which I think even further than a wall. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4138.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Further than it is now, because they've already got it down to where it was [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4144.080000000001s)]
*  when they built the wall as much as they got built. Right. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4147.92s)]
*  It's the same numbers as at the end of the pre covid stuff for Trump. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4150.4800000000005s)]
*  Four hundred thousand a day, whatever it is. Right. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4153.92s)]
*  And she wants to take it even further. She's not Joe Biden. Right. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4156.08s)]
*  So I agree with that, that it's a big deal. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4159.36s)]
*  But he also said he just wanted to deport everybody. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4163.2s)]
*  How the fuck do you do that? Yeah. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4167.56s)]
*  You're just going to walk into somebody's house. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4169.2s)]
*  Hey, I know there might be somebody who may or may not be illegal. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4170.84s)]
*  Get the local cops and just pull them out of their house. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4175.28s)]
*  You know, what's that going to do to cities? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4178.56s)]
*  You know, I mean, you go through L.A. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4180.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of illegals. Right. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4183.08s)]
*  But they're not all have not all their families are illegal. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4185.2s)]
*  The hint. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4189.0s)]
*  And so if your family is getting dragged out the front door, what are you doing? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4190.44s)]
*  Right. Right. And he gets the National Guard or local cops [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4194.32s)]
*  to start dragging people out, putting them in a bus and seven. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4197.44s)]
*  How do you think their community is going to respond? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4200.36s)]
*  Well, I guess it depends. Yeah, I think I agree. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4203.599999999999s)]
*  It's tough. It's like, how do you get into the minutiae of some of those things? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4206.32s)]
*  You got to follow the law. Right. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4209.76s)]
*  But he's saying he's just going to drag them out their doors. Right. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4211.04s)]
*  He hasn't given any real details how he would do it. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4213.36s)]
*  And what I'm saying is, if it's let's just say he decided it's against Jewish people. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4215.88s)]
*  Yeah. Just pull it out of left field. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4219.48s)]
*  I'm not saying he is. He's not going to. Right. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4220.84s)]
*  That's happened to us before. Right. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4223.24s)]
*  And in a country where there's this many guns, people are pulling out their guns. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4225.2s)]
*  Right. And I'm I don't know, but I'm thinking if I'm Hispanic [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4228.679999999999s)]
*  and I have a brother-in-law or, you know, somebody, my father, whatever, who's illegal [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4232.4s)]
*  and they're just coming to my front door, I'm not just letting them take him [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4238.08s)]
*  and just say, thank you very much. Give me another. Right. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4241.84s)]
*  Unless you do it the right way. There's way. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4244.52s)]
*  Look, they called Obama the deporter in chief. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4246.88s)]
*  He deported more people than Trump ever did. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4249.76s)]
*  But he followed the law to do it. Yeah. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4252.72s)]
*  As long as you follow the law, that's great. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4254.76s)]
*  But when when Donald goes around saying, we're just going to fucking kick him out. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4256.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. I'm going to do whatever. Right. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4259.88s)]
*  That just sounds like more it sounds like a boast and not like more than the actual practice. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4262.0s)]
*  Right. More gangster. Right. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4266.04s)]
*  But I think the fact that so many people have been let in, it's like there's [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4267.280000000001s)]
*  Venezuelans in Brooklyn that are running like prostitution rings out of parks over there. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4270.56s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and I don't. Yeah. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4276.8s)]
*  And there's Americans doing the same shit, too. Right. Right. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4278.6s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4281.120000000001s)]
*  But I'm not trying to make excuses for him. Yeah. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4281.96s)]
*  Get the motherfuckers out. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4283.76s)]
*  But follow the law to do it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4285.4400000000005s)]
*  Tell us how you're going to do it. Right. That's a good point. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4287.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He doesn't Donald does. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4289.0s)]
*  It doesn't have much of a he's not very finessed when it comes to the emotional [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4290.56s)]
*  comfort of how something's found. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4294.68s)]
*  Just respect the law. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4296.360000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, shit could hit the fan in a bad way. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4297.96s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4300.72s)]
*  The fact that people have come in lawlessly, it feels like I didn't fucked up. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4301.56s)]
*  No one's changed. No, no one's saying he didn't. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4305.12s)]
*  Yeah. Right. He let too many people in that that could have been the Bernie Sanders side of him. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4307.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. I'm not saying, you know, he did the right thing. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4311.88s)]
*  Yeah. Right. But you are where you are. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4315.08s)]
*  Right. So the only question is, how do you fix it? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4317.88s)]
*  Right. And just saying you are where you are. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4320.32s)]
*  You are where you are. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4322.84s)]
*  The situation is the situation when that company cast or whatever it was, fucked you up. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4324.04s)]
*  You were where you were. Yeah. You just had to deal with it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4329.16s)]
*  Yeah. Right. You could sue. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4331.52s)]
*  You could do whatever you could follow a law. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4332.92s)]
*  You did what you had to do. Right. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4334.36s)]
*  It's the same with this. Right. You are where you are. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4336.28s)]
*  And if he's going to get people out, which you should, he's not saying I'll follow the Obama model. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4338.48s)]
*  But instead of three million people deported, it's going to be 11 million. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4344.56s)]
*  Right. Let's hear the practice more. Right. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4347.56s)]
*  What is it? How do you do it? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4349.32s)]
*  When you have 300 million, 400 million guns in a fucking country, people aren't just going to say, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4350.6s)]
*  take my brother. Thank you very much. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4356.280000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah. You know, that's a great point. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4358.400000000001s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think that you have to have more of an idea of, yeah, how are things going to be done? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4361.96s)]
*  You got to tell us how you're going to do it. Right. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4366.400000000001s)]
*  You can't just say I'm going to deport because to your point, right, it gets people mad and they want to vote because they feel threatened. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4368.200000000001s)]
*  Right. They don't feel safe. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4374.280000000001s)]
*  You know, and I don't blame them for not feeling for being mad and not feeling safe. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4375.6s)]
*  That's legit. Right. But how are you going to fix it? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4379.4s)]
*  Right. Come on saying, OK, here's the program, right, that we got from James Lankford, whoever the guy from Oklahoma, I think it is, who for this Republican bill. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4383.28s)]
*  I'll sign it. Right. Because this is a problem. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4392.04s)]
*  She hasn't said how she's going to deal with deportations. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4394.28s)]
*  That's something that she should be asked. I don't know the answer. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4396.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know where her head is on that. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4399.08s)]
*  But I do know that if you go more gangster on this, that it could escalate and get worse, you think? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4400.92s)]
*  Yeah. Wouldn't you? I don't know. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4406.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I hadn't thought about it like that exactly. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4409.96s)]
*  You know, I hadn't thought about that. What are the actual practices of it? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4412.12s)]
*  You know, dude, dude hires people, illegals in Mar-a-Lago. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4414.48s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4418.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, well, that's an interesting thing about our whole country is it's like people say, well, we don't want illegals here. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4419.719999999999s)]
*  But then people hire illegals to also do their do the job. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4424.679999999999s)]
*  Right. And they're not doing like they're not doing these jobs. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4427.759999999999s)]
*  Right. They're doing, you know, the shitty jobs. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4430.32s)]
*  But most of the people that are coming over now, it's gotten so much more out of like people just coming over to work and send money back home. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4433.28s)]
*  It's gotten like most of the people aren't even Mexican people that are coming over now. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4439.44s)]
*  It's all other types, which doesn't make those people any better or any worse. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4443.4s)]
*  No, I hear you. But it's still like if it's like it just makes me like I can't walk. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4447.36s)]
*  I'm scared to let my kid walk the block to school now or just because I don't know. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4452.04s)]
*  And if you feel like these people don't have a Social Security number, then there's no way to even prosecute them or have them be contributing. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4456.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, no, that's not true. Right. So even if they don't have a Social Security number, if they break the law, they'll deport them. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4463.24s)]
*  Right. Or they'll throw them in jail, whatever it may be. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4470.32s)]
*  They're not saying because you don't have a Social Security number, you can't be prosecuted. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4473.4s)]
*  Oh, I see. Right. Yeah. That's not the way it works. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4476.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah, a lot of people, the executive branch, one of the border patrol guys said that the executive branch, they're not doing the processing well enough. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4480.84s)]
*  So a lot of times they get the same people over and over again. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4490.44s)]
*  Yeah, they send them back. They come right back over. They send them back. That's fucked up. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4493.0s)]
*  Right. So we have obviously we have to do better. Yeah. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4496.04s)]
*  And there used to be a program where families got to sponsor somebody that was coming over back in the day. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4499.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't know where that is or what's going on. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4504.04s)]
*  I would just be cool because then you as a person that's already that lives here or is a citizen here, you feel like you have a connection to that. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4506.12s)]
*  You know, it's like that's how my grandparents got in the country. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4513.64s)]
*  Yeah. They came over from Ukraine and all over the fucking place. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4516.04s)]
*  It was either either be killed where they were or get your ass over here. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4519.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. Right. I just think we're in a tough space in this country where it's like people are struggling with addiction. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4522.84s)]
*  People are struggling with homeownership. We're dealing with, you know, less marriages than ever. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4528.2s)]
*  Like the family unit is broken. People are scared. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4533.72s)]
*  You know, a person can't care about their kids because they have to fucking work all day or they can. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4536.76s)]
*  But it's just hard to manage. And how do you think you fix that? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4542.36s)]
*  I don't know. And I think it's a lot to think that one person could be the person that does it. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4546.52s)]
*  And I don't even know how you as a as a leader say you need the help from the people because they're already stressed. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4553.160000000001s)]
*  That's what a leader is supposed to do. Right. Right. That's the whole job. Right. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4560.120000000001s)]
*  That's why I turned on Trump because he didn't pay attention to those details. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4564.280000000001s)]
*  It wasn't like he had a team that was like, I got this guy to do this. I got this guy to do that. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4567.72s)]
*  And even now, who else? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4572.52s)]
*  Well, at least he I do like that he brought in Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4574.6s)]
*  You know, I'm not a big Bobby. Can you? No, not at all. Yeah. Yeah. Because of the health care shit. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4577.64s)]
*  I like his stuff on unprocessed foods. Right. I think that's legit. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4581.88s)]
*  In fact, one of my buddies, Todd Wagner, one of my partners, this whole thing is getting rid of unprocessed foods. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4584.84s)]
*  He helped sign a law in California to get all these dyes and shit out. So I'm in agreement there. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4590.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That's one thing I love about him and clean water, just trying to clean up the environment. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4594.92s)]
*  I'm cool with that. Yeah. Those are the things that I love. Those are the things that I only really know that he does. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4598.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I got no problem with that side of him. Right. The whole vaccine thing. I think that's he's misguided on that. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4601.88s)]
*  But that's what makes a market. Right. That's OK. People can disagree. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4607.24s)]
*  And you need somebody to say this is you needed a you needed because half of America was like, this feels like we should just let it. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4610.68s)]
*  It's not that dangerous. We should let it figure itself out. And nobody was even allowed to say that. It felt like they were that that this feels like a that during covid. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4621.08s)]
*  This just feels like something that we need to let it run its course through people instead of like going this in this such a like a kind of almost felt like a communist route of like locking everything down. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4631.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we don't have to go into that. Yeah. I was responsible for 20,000 people coming into a Mavs game. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4644.599999999999s)]
*  And if somebody would have died because I didn't want them to be vaccine, you would get sued to none of that. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4650.2s)]
*  I would have felt like shit for the rest of my life. Yeah. Right. So just different. Yeah. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4654.759999999999s)]
*  So everybody can have different perspectives on that. I was pro vax. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4658.5199999999995s)]
*  I was pro vax. Yeah. I don't know what I was vax on it. I don't know. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4661.96s)]
*  I mean, I guess I guess I was probably anti. I don't know if I was anti vax. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4665.24s)]
*  I just felt like like they suddenly shut down all of the A.A. rooms and shit. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4668.679999999999s)]
*  And that killed so many people because they couldn't go get meetings. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4672.919999999999s)]
*  And you're like, can't zoom everything. Yeah. Right. Like I'm going to die because I'm an addict. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4676.04s)]
*  And I don't know. My brother's 17 years sober. So I went through all that shit. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4680.28s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm not having some of that. So I just think that the way that it was all handled felt like [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4686.36s)]
*  with everything. It's easy to look back. Yeah. Right. You can look at everything differently. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4692.44s)]
*  Right. Because in hindsight, everything's 2020. Yeah. Right. But when you're in the middle of it [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4697.24s)]
*  and people are fucking dying, it's scary as fuck. Yeah. But that's the difference between leadership. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4702.28s)]
*  Like going back to leadership. I mean, you nailed it. You need leaders. Right. And leaders may not be [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4707.0s)]
*  able to do everything themselves personally, but you got to have people around you that can do it. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4713.16s)]
*  And that's where I think Trump is fucked up. Yeah. You don't hear a lot about who he's going [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4718.28s)]
*  to get to help him with each thing. And a lot of it's because the people who he used before all [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4722.04s)]
*  turned on him. Right. All his cabinet members, 40 of his 44 cabinet members said, we ain't voting [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4726.12s)]
*  for him. Right. We don't think he's qualified to do this job. And, you know, so health care, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4731.32s)]
*  you hear Vance mentioned some things, but what else? Right. Deportations. You hear Donald say [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4738.68s)]
*  he's going to do it. But how? Right. Can you name one thing that Donald said, how he's going to do it? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4743.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think, well, I think that's another thing that even on the Kamala side, it's like, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4749.56s)]
*  I wish there were more, some specifics about the policies. It's almost like [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4755.08s)]
*  they could both use a tune up in some of that area. For sure. Now, you know, we got 45 days or [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4760.04s)]
*  whatever it is to find out from Kamala what she's going to do. I'm pushing them to get as much detail [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4764.84s)]
*  out. Right. I talked to their team three, four times a week via text. Right. And I give them [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4769.08s)]
*  shit when they deserve shit. Right. And I'll say what I think. And they listen though. Right. They [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4776.4400000000005s)]
*  may not agree all the time, but they'll listen. Yeah. And so I know, like, when I talk to her team, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4780.4400000000005s)]
*  they're like, okay, we got to talk to the policy director of this or that. Right. Health care, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4787.88s)]
*  we're going to talk about, you know, independent pharmacies going up. Okay. We have a group that's [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4792.28s)]
*  looking at healthcare in general. Let us get your feedback and go. Like I was talking to them the [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4796.84s)]
*  other day on Amazon. Do you sell anything on Amazon by chance? I never, I bought stuff on there. Yeah. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4800.92s)]
*  But never. Okay. So like little, like shark, I found this on Shark Tank. Right. So little companies [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4806.36s)]
*  that make headphones, right. They get knocked off a lot, a lot. Right. So you come up with an idea [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4811.08s)]
*  to do something, blood, sweat and tears. You put it on Amazon. Some fuckers in China are like, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4819.16s)]
*  I make that shit. Right. I'm going to go on there and just knock it off. Right. And sell it there. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4824.84s)]
*  And as a little company, it's hard. It's not impossible, but it's hard to get Amazon to take [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4830.04s)]
*  it down, particularly on a timely basis. And so they lose, you know, they can lose half, 75% [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4834.76s)]
*  all of their sales to these knockoffs. Right. And so I said to them, you know, hey, here's what I [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4841.16s)]
*  learned from these companies, right? Amazon isn't the good partner they used to be for these little [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4846.28s)]
*  companies. Can we do something together? Can I put something together? Like, yeah, put something [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4850.28s)]
*  together for us because you're right. We need to do it. It's not right that China's knocking off [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4855.0s)]
*  some of our smallest entrepreneurs, even big entrepreneurs, right. And stealing their business. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4859.24s)]
*  So it's not about tariffs. It's about, okay. So I proposed to them, can we get these Chinese companies [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4863.08s)]
*  to register before they're allowed to sell on Amazon? Get them to put up like a 25K bond in case [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4868.28s)]
*  they rip off people. There's some money there, right? For every product they sell, you're going [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4874.04s)]
*  to sell headphones, right? Post it up, just like a patent. You have to post your patent before it [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4878.28s)]
*  gets approved. Yeah. Almost like you have to put your rating in the restaurant window or whatever. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4883.08s)]
*  Yeah, right. Same type of thing, right? So post whatever it is you're going to sell and put up [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4886.76s)]
*  five grand for it, right? Again, in case you violate IP, that's revenue for the country [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4890.76s)]
*  that protects our small independent businesses, right? And it protects us against China who, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4896.12s)]
*  you know, they don't care about IP all the time, right? And they were like, great idea. We have a [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4901.96s)]
*  policy team to look at that stuff for us, right? That's the big difference, right? So we don't have [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4907.16s)]
*  all the details yet. And I think that's not as good as it should be. But hopefully we'll get all those [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4912.76s)]
*  out in policy papers and everything and get some details. I haven't even seen who Trump is going to [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4918.12s)]
*  turn to for details. So you feel like with the Democratic Party that with Kamala's group that [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4923.4s)]
*  there's more organization, a lot more and a lot more details paid attention to, right? And I think [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4928.92s)]
*  that's important. Maybe there's people that Donald has put together and we just don't see it. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4934.36s)]
*  But you don't think there is. Who do you think is going to? Well, thanks, man. Yeah, I like talking [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4941.16s)]
*  about that stuff. Sometimes I get kind of scared to talk about it, I guess, because some things I [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4949.08s)]
*  don't know and everybody does. Nobody knows everything. Nobody knows shit can be a big [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4953.16s)]
*  picture, right? Do you think who do you think will win? I have no idea. I know. That fucking [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4956.84s)]
*  crazy. Crazy. Do you think we still have a fair election process in this country? Absolutely. You [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4963.4800000000005s)]
*  do. Yeah, absolutely. That's my biggest fear is just that we don't have one. And that I think [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4968.12s)]
*  and when you start to that's one thing it gets really weird because you start to think that [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4973.32s)]
*  since other things seem kind of like lobbyists are involved in everything and there's, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4979.4800000000005s)]
*  Bernie Sanders saying we have more lobbyists than we have reps and senators. That I believe, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4983.8s)]
*  right? He said there's three lobbyists for every one of this. Like within what? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4990.04s)]
*  What's the real government? Almost feels like the lobbyist becomes real government. So like, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4994.28s)]
*  then you start to just so I'll finish part, but then you start to think that if that all that [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=4997.719999999999s)]
*  feels so compromised is the voting compromised. Yeah. I mean, you don't think it is no as a geek. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5003.16s)]
*  Yeah. And having looked at a lot of this stuff, I mean, I'm not the ultimate geek in all this, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5008.28s)]
*  but I'm pretty confident. And plus they've been sued a thousand times. All the states that Trump [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5012.68s)]
*  questioned were audited and had recounts and notice he didn't question the states he won. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5021.96s)]
*  Yeah. That's a good point. Right. So it's not like he didn't trust it. Right. He just, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5026.68s)]
*  and I remember going, I got invited by Clinton to one of the early debates in 2016. And he was [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5032.36s)]
*  talking then about how the election wasn't going to be fair. So one of the coolest books I ever [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5038.68s)]
*  read was about a guy named Roy Cohen. Right. And I don't know if you ever heard of the McCarthy [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5043.56s)]
*  trials in the fifties where they were calling everybody a communist. Yeah. Right. And so I did [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5047.72s)]
*  a movie actually executive produced a movie called good night and good luck got nominated for six [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5052.280000000001s)]
*  Academy awards. George Clooney, George Clooney. Right. It was all about that. Well, Roy Cohen [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5055.96s)]
*  was Donald Trump mentor and Roy Cohen, who it was the guy who was defending the people saying, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5060.76s)]
*  you're communist, you're communist. Right. And his, his approach was deny, deny, deny, deny. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5065.8s)]
*  And it's your fault. It's your fault. It's your fault. And they're out to get me. Everything [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5071.08s)]
*  Donald is doing is Roy Cohen part two. So you feel like that's a lot of his motive. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5074.68s)]
*  Yeah. That's a template. Great. Yeah. That's the right word template. Yeah. And I think a lot of [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5080.92s)]
*  people feel like the, the it's also against them that they'll throw a wrench into the, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5084.68s)]
*  just to fuck it up further, right? Well, no, just because it's like, let's we'll fire anything at, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5092.2s)]
*  you know, it's like, I think there's a lot of that mentality is that he's not a politician. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5096.76s)]
*  So they're going after him. So it's better than having a politician either because the [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5101.96s)]
*  politics, because the political landscape has gotten so I would agree. Look, like when Biden [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5106.76s)]
*  was running, I feel differently about Kamala, but when Biden was running, if you had a non-MAGA [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5112.04s)]
*  Republican running, I would probably vote for them. Right. I'm, you know, I just, and you nailed it. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5116.84s)]
*  Right. So social liberal fiscally conservative. Yeah. The whole, the whole gangster thing. I think [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5124.52s)]
*  that's just wrong. Yeah. Like when I was a little kid, I used to go with my buddy Jay and his dad [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5128.84s)]
*  was a numbers collector, you know, and so we would go really. Yeah. When he has plus three, dude. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5133.08s)]

*  allow you to pick a number. I don't know out of how many you think one to 20, you pick a number [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5150.68s)]
*  and you bet, right. And each number had different odds. And if your number came up, you got paid. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5154.68s)]
*  It's not like roulette. That was it. Yeah. That was more like calling numbers, right? It was like [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5160.04s)]
*  roulette, but somebody came and told you what the number was. Yeah. They just posted the number and [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5163.4800000000005s)]
*  that was it. Right. And they knew what you had bet. And if you didn't pay up, right, not that they [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5166.68s)]
*  would hear them, but they were just my, my buddy's dad used to sit there with a little, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5172.2s)]
*  no little souvenir baseball bats. They give a games, a little tiny one. Pat, Pat, Pat. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5175.24s)]
*  And it was cool as shit sitting in his, you know, 1968 Buick Riviera. I thought it was badass as [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5180.12s)]
*  hell at the time, but collecting numbers. That's cool. But the gangster shit, right? Yeah. Once a [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5184.76s)]
*  gangster, always a gangster. And when it comes time to dealing with stuff, it's self-preservation [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5190.92s)]
*  first. That's the number one rule of being a gangster, isn't it? You know, stay out of jail, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5196.76s)]
*  keep your shit going. That's not putting the country first. Well, yeah. The problem is it [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5200.6s)]
*  feels like the country hasn't been first for a long time. And so people want a gangster. So that's [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5205.160000000001s)]
*  why I understand. I understand too, right? You explained it better than anybody, right? The way [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5209.8s)]
*  you said it to me was the only thing that I've been told. Okay. I get that. Right. You know, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5214.360000000001s)]

*  but it'd be, I'll put in a good word for you. Yeah. It'd be interesting, you know, just to, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5253.72s)]
*  I think, cause the toughest thing as like a regular person who just can go vote, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5256.84s)]
*  it's like you've just, even more these days, you want to try and figure out who is this person, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5262.6s)]

*  through. Right. Like you just even mean on a human basis. Yeah. On a human basis. Like, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5283.8s)]
*  why would I put my family through that? Right. Right. And we'll cause plus I can have an impact. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5287.64s)]
*  Right. And I just think I can do more outside than inside. And I'm just not good at, you know, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5291.96s)]
*  all the formalities and all that shit. You know, you're not, I mean, showing up at a state dinner [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5297.08s)]

*  That would be me. Oh, I just think people would love that. Yeah. Um, my wife would kill me. What [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5305.56s)]
*  did you ever ask her what she thought? Yeah. They, my family voted no. No way. You sat them [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5310.68s)]
*  down for them. One. Yes. Adam Don Ford. No one. Yes. Oh man. Did you even try to lobby one of them [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5314.360000000001s)]
*  to even help you a little? Well, my, my son got into it a little bit, but he was only like 13 at [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5321.8s)]
*  the time. So it was damn. Yeah. I guess what, what moments or what, what, what is it the part of you [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5326.4400000000005s)]
*  that makes you feel like you want, would want to do or could do it? Because I just want to do the [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5334.4400000000005s)]
*  right thing. Right. You know, if there's a deep state, I don't need anything from anybody. Right. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5338.92s)]
*  You can't buy me. Right. And I try to be smart about things. I'm curious and I like to learn. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5344.92s)]
*  I want to listen and be open-minded. Um, and I think I've got approaches that have worked for [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5351.4s)]
*  me in the past, but also are getting results now, you know, um, like the cost plus drug stuff. I [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5357.24s)]
*  know how to change industries, whether it was a streaming industry, HDTV, you know, movies, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5364.84s)]
*  whatever it is, any industry I've gotten into, I've managed to kind of bubble to the top. Yeah. And [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5369.24s)]
*  you know, and I also know, you know, to trust smart people, to partner with people who know [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5375.0s)]
*  shit that I don't know how to, you know, how to compliment my skillsets. I mean, I, maybe I'd be [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5379.24s)]
*  too honest about the whole thing, but I think I could do a good job, but there's just no way I'm [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5385.0s)]
*  putting my family through that. Right. So that's why maybe if you had an extra 15 years in your [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5389.88s)]
*  life, you would think about it. Um, yeah, but there's still my family, right. And it's like, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5394.6s)]
*  like, yeah, I mean, when Clinton was president, the worst he did was try to smoke dope. Right. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5400.04s)]
*  You know, and Obama, and he got that homer too. Yeah. Well, yeah, but that was after the fact [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5405.08s)]
*  that he was already in, right? Yeah. But I mean, and was it, I mean, who knows? Look, I think if [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5409.96s)]
*  you're the president, but he was married though. Yeah. That was why whatever it was, right? Yeah. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5415.88s)]
*  You know, to get elected, all you had to do was say, I didn't inhale. Right. Now shit's [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5421.72s)]
*  totally different now. Yeah. Shit's way different. You know, you got pictures. Yeah. Your kids were [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5426.84s)]
*  here. You were there doing this, doing that. It would put your family through brutal. Yeah. Brutal. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5431.16s)]
*  So that's a big reason really. Do you think that keeps a lot of people out of it? Yeah, for sure. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5436.84s)]
*  Wow. For sure. It is. It's a scrutiny. It's that media scrutiny that they look at Kamala, right? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5440.92s)]
*  She was 30 years old, fucking a dude older, right. Or young. She's in her 20s. Yeah. Montel Jordan [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5446.280000000001s)]
*  or whatever, right? Just having fun. If it was me and you, we'd be like, let's go party with [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5450.52s)]
*  Kamala Montel, right? Let's go, go, let's go. Right. And now, you know, all the shit she goes through and [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5455.160000000001s)]
*  that's not bad. Right. But imagine that, you know, she doesn't, you know, and even like her [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5461.56s)]
*  stepdaughter, the one who was a little, you know, that has all the tattoos and shit that they were [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5466.92s)]
*  giving shit to. Oh, I haven't seen her. Yeah. Only because- Oh wait, I did see her. Yeah. They gave her [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5470.68s)]
*  shit because- Yeah, like- How she looks. Yeah. Yeah. The tats and everything and all that and [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5475.88s)]
*  whatever. Right. I don't remember all the details. Well, yeah. And remember the Baron Trump stories [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5481.32s)]
*  came out. He has autism. He has Down syndrome or whatever. You're like, what are you talking about? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5484.6s)]
*  But I will tell you this. When I went to the White House to visit Donald, you know, he was rambling [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5488.04s)]
*  around talking- This was when he was in office? Yeah. And this was like 2019. He's like, da, da, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5491.64s)]
*  da, da, da, da, da. And we were talking, trying to talk about healthcare. We went off in a bunch [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5495.32s)]
*  of different stuff. He goes, are you still on that show? Shark whatever. I'm like, yeah. He goes, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5498.52s)]
*  Baron loves that show. I'm like, tell Baron. And he goes, that's his favorite show. I'm like, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5503.32s)]
*  tell Baron, thanks. And then I'm walking out. He goes, wait, I'm like, what? He goes, that suit [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5507.799999999999s)]
*  looks really good on you. That's who he is, right? He's going to give compliments like that and shit [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5513.24s)]
*  like that. Yeah. What was I going to- Oh, I want to talk about your, your, the drug companies. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5518.2s)]
*  Custprsdrugs.com. Okay. Because yeah, one of the toughest things is that people pay more. Well, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5525.799999999999s)]
*  first you tell me what's the best order for this because we talked about like the insurance, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5532.2s)]
*  the scam that goes on between hospitals and insurers and regular people. And then can you [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5537.16s)]
*  explain that to me and then tell me how your drug helps, how the company helps? So where we fit in [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5544.04s)]
*  all that. Okay. Okay. So there's insured, well, that's the best way to explain it. There's [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5548.04s)]
*  drugs that you take and then there's what they call providers, the hospitals you go to, right? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5557.08s)]
*  Okay. So the hospitals you go to is the provider. The provider, right? And then there's the payers, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5561.96s)]
*  which are the insurance companies. Okay. And the insurance companies try to do deals with the [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5566.36s)]
*  providers, but they're not always up and up, right? The providers, it's not the providers, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5571.32s)]
*  it's just the insurance companies have all the leverage because they have the money, right? And [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5578.04s)]
*  hospitals are just trying to get all the business that they can get. And so there's all these games [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5583.24s)]
*  and arbitrages that are played over and over and over again. But what I think people don't realize [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5588.36s)]
*  is almost everybody with healthcare, like where do you get your healthcare or do you just self-pay or [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5595.719999999999s)]
*  do you have insurance? I have health insurance. Through, do you know? I'm not sure, but it costs [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5601.48s)]
*  $400 a month. Okay. So it's probably the ACA, right? The Obamacare, right? But you have a deductible, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5605.96s)]
*  right? And let's just say for the shits and giggles, that's $2,000 deductible. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5612.04s)]
*  Um, for the hospital, even though this insurance company is going to pay anything above 2000, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5616.92s)]
*  you're responsible for that $2,000, right? And the hospital, like, is already not going to get [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5623.08s)]
*  paid on 50% of the deductibles. And so that's why you get a lot of this bad debt. The insurance [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5629.320000000001s)]
*  companies don't pay for the whole thing and they plan everything so they don't have to play for the [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5634.84s)]
*  whole thing. And that creates a lot of medical debt. And so there's a lot- [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5639.88s)]
*  Medical debt that the hospitals owe. No, that, um, the individuals with the deductibles, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5645.8s)]
*  I see what you're saying. Right? Because they can't afford to pay their deductible. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5650.84s)]
*  Got it. Right? And so, you know, you have some disease and you can't afford your deductible, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5653.24s)]
*  which is 2000. It doesn't matter that it covers above 2000, right? Because you can't pay the first [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5658.84s)]
*  2000. Right? So that puts, that puts people in a lot of fucked up situations and even hospitals, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5663.8s)]
*  the providers in such bad situations, because a big part of their revenue isn't getting paid. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5669.56s)]
*  Right? And here's the insurance company not giving a fuck. Right? They're just saying that's your [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5674.76s)]
*  problem, not mine. Right? Right. I'll pay you what I think I owe you. Maybe. Right? And so all that, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5679.72s)]
*  the insurance companies put pressure on the hospitals, the providers, the doctors, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5685.88s)]
*  and the doctors then put pressure on the patients. That's where it's all fucked up. Right? And so [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5690.2s)]
*  what we're pushing for with the Harris campaign and in general is a lot of that happens because [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5695.88s)]
*  there's no transparency. Nobody knows what the contract is with between the insurance company [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5701.32s)]
*  and the hospitals. Nobody knows what the contract is between the insurance company and your employer. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5706.12s)]
*  And so as a result, the biggest companies have the most leverage and can fuck with everybody. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5712.36s)]
*  And that's where things go bad. So what I'm saying is if you make every insurance contract [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5717.08s)]
*  and provider contract public, then all of a sudden people can understand just how to power [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5722.6s)]
*  to the patients. You familiar with them? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a group out there called [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5728.04s)]
*  power to the patient that lobbies for price. Did you have to know how much an MRI costs when [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5731.4800000000005s)]
*  you go to get it? Right. So that that way, if the hospital says the MRI costs $700 and the one down [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5738.360000000001s)]
*  the street is going to have to say it costs $650 and they're going to have to start to compete. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5743.48s)]
*  Right. And they're going to have to start to compete. Right. And there's an executive order [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5747.0s)]
*  that says they have to do that. Right. And that was a good thing that Trump did, but it wasn't [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5750.04s)]
*  enforced by the Biden administration. Well, because the penalty is only like a thousand dollars a day. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5754.12s)]
*  So they'd rather pay the penalty. Right. Right. And so like I funded a study that had people call [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5758.919999999999s)]
*  the hospitals to see if they can get those cash prices. Yeah. Right. And a lot of them didn't even [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5764.599999999999s)]
*  know a third of them didn't even know what the cash prices were. Right. Wow. So they're not being [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5768.679999999999s)]
*  instructed. They just don't know. Right. Because that's not they don't care. That's not a big part [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5772.52s)]
*  of their business. Right. They want to get all the money from the insurance companies. So anyways, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5776.280000000001s)]
*  circling around to what we do. Right. So I got a cold email just like Thomas the pizza guy. I got [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5780.52s)]
*  a cold email from a guy named Dr. Alex Oshmayansky. And he said that there are a lot of generic drugs [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5786.120000000001s)]
*  that were in short supply and kids can't get their medicine and this and that. And I'm like, well, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5792.76s)]
*  what can we do about that? And he's like, well, I want to do this thing called a compounding [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5796.84s)]
*  pharmacy where we can make those drugs. Right. And so he's like, I wanted to start a compounding [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5800.44s)]
*  pharmacy where you guys can make those drugs that are in short supply. I'm like, that's cool. But [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5806.5199999999995s)]
*  it's not thinking big enough. So I'm like, let me look at the pharmaceutical industry and the drug [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5809.799999999999s)]
*  industry and see why so many people can't afford them and what's going on. So I looked at it and [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5815.0s)]
*  it was really obvious really fast that there's no transparency. Right. Because nobody you know, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5819.88s)]
*  just like you don't know when you go in for your MRI, like doctor says, Theo, you need this [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5824.76s)]
*  medication. You have no clue what the price is going to be. The next question always, what [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5830.6s)]
*  pharmacy are you using? Right. They're not saying, can you afford it or anything? Right. So we decided [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5835.400000000001s)]
*  to create this company called cost plus drugs.com. And if you go to cost plus drugs.com and put in [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5840.4400000000005s)]
*  the name of a medication, we don't have them all. We have about 2500. We'll show you our cost, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5845.56s)]
*  our actual cost that we actually pay for it. And then we market up 15%. And then there's $5 [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5850.76s)]
*  shipping and handling to send it to you. And then $5 for our pharmacy. Or if you pick it up locally, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5857.08s)]
*  it's $12. So the pharmacist makes money. And because of that, because that transparency [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5862.12s)]
*  and only marketing up 15%, our prices are dramatically lower. And when the insurance [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5867.320000000001s)]
*  companies are trying to rip people off, like there's a drug called a Matnib. And if you don't come to [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5873.56s)]
*  us or some of the better pharmacies, smaller pharmacies, you might get charged $2,000 a month. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5879.0s)]
*  For us, it might be $21 a month. I had a buddy who takes this drug, Droxodopa. And I didn't know [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5885.88s)]
*  what the fuck it was, right? A friend of ours emailed me and said, Landon can't get this because- [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5892.12s)]
*  Droxodopa? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5896.6s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know what it is. Sounds like a drug, right? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5897.4s)]
*  Sounds like a free safety product. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5898.84s)]
*  Right. And so he was like, he can't, you know, he lost his insurance and they're going to charge [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5900.2s)]
*  him $10,000 every three months. I'm like- [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5905.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5908.4400000000005s)]
*  Crazy. So I'm like, let me see what we can get it for. And go ahead and go to CosmosDrugs.com [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5909.240000000001s)]
*  and put in Droxodopa. And $64 for the three months. And yeah, you don't need to show that part. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5914.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So go to See All Medications and then Droxodopa. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5924.92s)]
*  Now it's $14. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5928.599999999999s)]
*  Put some Nicorette on there, dude. You just sell the lights out of it. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5929.639999999999s)]
*  Droxodopa, so now it's $14. So you guys, because you're able to make the drugs yourself? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5933.32s)]
*  No, we, because we're able to buy them in volume and because we only mark them up 15%. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5937.4s)]
*  Well, why doesn't our own government do that to help us? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5941.48s)]
*  Well, they're starting to now, but see, the problem was we publish our prices and we put out a [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5944.12s)]
*  price list. Before we came along, nobody else did. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5948.28s)]
*  So you're creating a price list for your company. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5951.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5953.879999999999s)]
*  So now people see our prices and they're like, okay, millions of people are just going to [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5954.599999999999s)]
*  CosmosDrugs.com, right? And the doctors are like, fuck, Droxodopa, $14 instead of this other [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5958.12s)]
*  place, we want a 3000 plus a month. We're going to CosmosDrugs.com. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5963.08s)]
*  Are all your drugs cheaper? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5966.2s)]
*  I'd say 99% of them are. Yeah. Every now and then there's one where we're not cheaper, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5968.04s)]
*  but every time we get, as our volumes go up and our prices go down, we pass it on. So literally, [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5972.12s)]
*  we're going to be able to sell our drugs. And then we're going to be able to sell our drugs. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5978.28s)]
*  We pass it on. So literally we've lowered our prices on every weekday since last August, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5982.76s)]
*  I guess it's been over a year now. We've lowered our prices. We've had some drug that has come in [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5988.4400000000005s)]
*  that we've been able to lower the price on. So anybody out there, you, your mom, your dad, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5993.0s)]
*  your aunt, your uncle, your grandparents, right? Whatever drug you take, if you're paying more [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=5997.160000000001s)]
*  than 15 bucks out of pocket, go to CosmosDrugs.com, put in the name of it and see if we're cheaper. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6002.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, literally it's crushing it. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6008.68s)]
*  Right. That's all it does. That's all it takes to check it out. That's it. You just do it. Right. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6010.68s)]
*  So like if you have a deductible, we might be cheaper than your deductible and it's cheaper [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6015.0s)]
*  to pay cash with us. Now, can people run into problems, say if they're not supposed to get [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6019.0s)]
*  certain drugs, is it easier to get those drugs through you guys? No, no, no. You still have to [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6022.76s)]
*  have a prescription. Like Percocets or whatever. No, no, no. We don't do any controlled substances. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6026.200000000001s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Huh. Wow, man. But how does our government, how does the government allow you [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6029.72s)]
*  to be able to do that? Well, they can't stop me, right? Because it's just free market stuff. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6035.0s)]
*  I'm glad that it's happening. No, they like it. Right. So now I'm talking to the Harris campaign [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6039.96s)]
*  and I'm saying, look, if we just do this transparency, you guys can buy it the same way we do. Right. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6044.04s)]
*  And so there was a thing from the FTC who went after all these things called these pharmacy [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6049.16s)]
*  benefit managers and just threw them under the bus and sued them, but they used our prices. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6053.48s)]
*  Right. Now there's research- In the lawsuit? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6057.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. There's research from like Vanderbilt and Harvard saying if the government of Medicare [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6059.32s)]
*  bought at our prices, they would save billions of dollars a year. Right. I mean, literally, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6064.52s)]
*  immediately, if some, there's people out there that are struggling with their prices, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6069.0s)]
*  what they pay, they switched to us. They're going to save a fuck ton of money. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6073.56s)]
*  And they can just do that, but it's their own choice. They don't need their doctor's approval. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6077.080000000001s)]
*  Well, they need to get a prescription to send to us. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6080.280000000001s)]
*  Okay. So let's say you need a prescription. Right. You still need to get a prescription. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6081.96s)]
*  But the doctor doesn't determine where they just usually say what your local pharmacy can say. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6084.200000000001s)]
*  Right. And you just tell it- What their practice is. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6088.92s)]
*  Right. And so you just say, you know, send it to costplusdrugs.com. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6089.96s)]
*  So in the system that the doctors use to create the prescription, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6093.0s)]
*  it lists us there and they just click on it and it's easy. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6096.68s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. No, it's insane. It's insane. Like literally, we only started June, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6099.56s)]
*  I mean, January 19th of 2022. So we've only been around a little bit more than two and a half years [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6103.72s)]
*  and we're just changing everything. Is it publicly traded or no? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6109.08s)]
*  No, no, no. It's private. I funded the whole thing. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6112.28s)]
*  Because I don't want to have to worry about making people money. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6116.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Because we're losing money now. Not that much actually now, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6118.2s)]
*  but it's more important for me to fuck things up. Right. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6121.4800000000005s)]
*  And change things. Oh, so you like the fact that you're [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6124.4400000000005s)]
*  changing the industry? Oh, fuck yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6125.96s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck yeah. I love that. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6127.320000000001s)]
*  No, no. Because to me, that's always the most fun. Right. So you've got all the- [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6128.76s)]
*  I mean, the healthcare industry, right? If, you know, what's the one thing you want to go down [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6132.12s)]
*  in history for? I fucked up the healthcare industry. Right. I made it so people could afford [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6135.8s)]
*  their healthcare, their medication. And so, you know, that's what we're doing with pharmaceuticals [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6139.8s)]
*  and medications. We're also working on costplus wellness, which will deal with and kind of push [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6143.8s)]
*  out those insurance companies. Because most people, like, get their healthcare through their [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6148.68s)]
*  employer. And most employers, particularly the big ones, self-insure, meaning they pay for all the [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6152.68s)]
*  cost out of pocket. And they don't realize how the employers, the CEOs of those companies, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6157.56s)]
*  don't realize how badly they're getting ripped off. And so we're out there working on new programs [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6162.200000000001s)]
*  now so that those employers will figure it out. We're starting with my companies, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6167.72s)]
*  and then we'll extend it out to other companies. Yeah. It's just crazy that I feel like it just [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6172.04s)]
*  needs overhauls of things, you know? And it's not that hard. This is like, this is the easiest [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6176.92s)]
*  industry I've ever disrupted. Because all we had to do was publish our price list. Right. Because [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6182.12s)]
*  everybody else was hiding everything, right? You talked before about shit happening behind the [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6185.88s)]
*  scenes. Yeah, because you go into the doctor, you go into the hospital, you sign something that says, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6189.72s)]
*  I'm going to pay whatever you charge me. Yeah, for sure. And you assume they're going to charge you [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6193.96s)]
*  the amount, the fairest amount, because they are a fucking hospital that's supposed to take care of [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6198.36s)]
*  you. You would think so, right? And then they don't. They charge. Whatever they can. But why do [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6203.4s)]
*  they do that? Because they're getting fucked by the insurance companies. Got it. Right? And they [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6208.36s)]
*  know that if you complain about the price, they'll reduce it. Right. So, but then you have to, you're [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6212.599999999999s)]
*  already sick. Now you have to spend the next 17 weeks of your life. Right, dealing with that shit, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6218.92s)]
*  right? Arguing with someone who's been trained how to argue against you. Exactly, exactly right. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6224.04s)]
*  And that's what we're going to fuck up. In another country most of the time. Actually, some of it's [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6229.24s)]
*  here. A lot of medical buildings here. Yeah. But then you know, if you're calling in, yeah, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6232.6s)]
*  it's over there. Yeah, for sure. And they feel horrible. Then the person arguing against you, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6235.88s)]
*  the person, the employee feels horrible because they know that they're, they're fucking you over. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6239.72s)]
*  They're fucking you over. But they're just trying to make their money to go on the hospital side. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6243.4800000000005s)]
*  The hospital has to have way too many employees to deal with the insurance company. And the [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6247.320000000001s)]
*  insurance company says, okay, we know this is what we're supposed to owe from when Theo took his kid [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6251.240000000001s)]
*  in there. Right. But we're not going to pay you the full amount. If you don't like that, sue us. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6255.160000000001s)]
*  And then they sue them. So now they have to have a shitload of doctors. Right. So what we're saying [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6258.6s)]
*  is we're going to these places and saying, we're going to do a contract. We're going to do just [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6262.44s)]
*  cash. Right. So there's no fucking around with the insurance companies and we're going to publish [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6265.96s)]
*  all the contracts so that everybody can compare notes and figure out the best way to do it. Yeah. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6270.2s)]
*  Well, that was, I mean, there was an executive order that said that they have to do that, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6275.96s)]
*  but it's not being enforced. Well, they do a little bit, but like, like we said earlier, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6279.719999999999s)]
*  not at a level where it's helping, where people are like, they should have a commercial, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6285.5599999999995s)]
*  the government should buy a commercial every week that runs a hundred times that says right [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6288.68s)]
*  now you have to, Trump administration announced historic price transparency requirements to [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6292.84s)]
*  increase competition and lower healthcare costs. So they said, I think for a hundred of the most, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6296.76s)]
*  something not good that Trump did. No, it's good. No, I'm not saying Trump did everything bad, right? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6300.76s)]
*  But this is one of the good things he did. But yeah, this is one of the things I think back then [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6304.76s)]
*  it was a hundred of the top services. Now it's 500, I think. And it's growing. That has to do it. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6310.04s)]
*  But how do we enforce it? That it's not being enforced. Well, so it's not so much enforcing [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6317.5599999999995s)]
*  that, right? Because if they put up shitty prices, it doesn't matter. If you show prices that are too [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6322.5199999999995s)]
*  expensive for everybody, you know, it doesn't matter. And so you want to be able to have the [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6326.92s)]
*  whole, the whole contract published so that everybody who's responsible for paying not only [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6331.8s)]
*  sees that price, but how it got to that price. And then people can create software and apps and this [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6337.32s)]
*  and that that can truly help you because most people do have some kind of insurance, right? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6341.96s)]
*  Like only 11% of people don't or they have high deductible plans. And if you have a high deductible [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6347.24s)]
*  plan, you don't quite know what you're going to end up paying out of pocket anyways, even if they [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6353.08s)]
*  tell you that it's only 750 for the MRI or 250 for the MRI, right? So that's, that's an important part [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6357.24s)]
*  of it, but it's that much of it. Yeah. It's just interesting. It's just tough that you have to [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6362.84s)]
*  figure out how am I getting screwed all the time? It's brutal. It's brutal, but that's the [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6367.8s)]
*  opportunity for me, right? Because Paul Rivera pills will call you. A couple of quick questions [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6371.8s)]
*  before you get out of here, man. Why did you sell the Mavs? This is what people know. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6379.08s)]
*  Kids, it was time, more time with my family. It was just, you know, and the fact that to compete, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6385.08s)]
*  which probably was as important to family in order for me to compete, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6393.08s)]
*  you got to generate more revenues. And when it was technology and media, I knew that shit cold. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6397.16s)]
*  But now it's like building casinos, building, you know, you see what happens with the Titan [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6402.5199999999995s)]
*  stadium and all the shit they put around it, right? That's not me. I'm not a real estate guy. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6406.84s)]
*  And I don't want to have to learn. I don't want to have to put up $2 billion to figure out if I'm [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6411.0s)]
*  doing it right or not. And so I brought in a great partner, Patrick Dumont and the Addison family, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6415.0s)]
*  who are big Trump supporters. And so they're just better at it than I am. And so I thought [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6419.64s)]
*  that put the Mavs in a better position and it didn't suck that I got all that money. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6426.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's selling. You mean? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's still on 27% and I'm still involved. So got it. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6430.360000000001s)]
*  It's a win-win. Was there another team that you wanted to buy recently? What about a WNBA team? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6434.6s)]
*  No, not really. Because it was more about just spending more time. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6438.92s)]
*  So that's just another. Yeah, because there's a lot of pressure, right? Because if I want to do it, [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6442.360000000001s)]
*  I want to win. Right. And I still, like I said, on 27% of the Mavs. That's still. Yeah. That's [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6445.96s)]
*  still big time. That's enough fun. Yeah. How much did you pay in fines during your MBA time? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6450.76s)]
*  Three, four, five million. I have no idea. What was your biggest fine? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6455.64s)]
*  Fuck. I think it was $600,000. So I grew up in Pittsburgh and my biggest basketball crush [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6463.56s)]
*  was Julius Irving, Dr. J. Right. And so he had me. Oh, that was bigger. Right. Okay. So we rested [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6472.68s)]
*  these guys. See, I forgot about this one. And so the end of two seasons ago, we weren't going to [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6479.88s)]
*  make the playoffs and we rested our best players. And even though every other team had been doing it, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6486.04s)]
*  they fucked with me and fined me for 750 grand. Damn. Because why? Because fans are coming, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6491.8s)]
*  the best players should be on the court. No, not necessarily. I mean, because like when a team is [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6496.280000000001s)]
*  bad, they will do what they can to get a better draft pick because that's how you're going to get [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6499.96s)]
*  good. Right. So we weren't going to do it. And they said we waited too long. Right. Like other teams [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6504.12s)]
*  might tank halfway through the season. They might tank three quarters the way, but because we did [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6508.68s)]
*  it with three games left, they thought that was wrong. I was pissed when I got that one. I would [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6512.36s)]
*  have been, Jesus Christ, I would have been pissed and sleeping outside. Cause I would have been [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6516.84s)]
*  living outside then. Was there one player you always wanted to get that you couldn't get? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6521.16s)]
*  I mean, I was like Shaq. Shaq was my guy. Shaq was like, come get me. Come get me. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6527.639999999999s)]
*  I have a house in Dallas. Come get me. I tried Shaq. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6533.8s)]
*  Oh, that'd have been fascinating having Shaq over there. I've heard you talk about crypto a lot. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6538.44s)]
*  Do you think it's a big part of our future or do you not think it's big? I think it can be. I think [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6543.72s)]
*  we don't know for sure yet. Okay. I think on one hand, Bitcoin is like the new gold, right? Because [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6547.08s)]
*  it's easy to own. It's easy to use apps to deal with it and everything. And I think that's a huge [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6552.12s)]
*  plus as opposed to gold where you've got, it's just more difficult to deal with and ain't nobody going [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6557.16s)]
*  to carry a brick of gold, right? If shit hits the fan. What are you going to do? Hey, this is my gold. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6561.8s)]
*  You know, not going to work. A couple of brothers might actually, dude. I know one of my dogs. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6566.12s)]
*  Oh, really? Oh yeah. I know a couple of dogs rolled around with a brick maybe, but yeah, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6572.599999999999s)]
*  but it's just going to create controversy. Different kind of brick. I'm talking about gold. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6575.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6578.759999999999s)]
*  But yeah, people would be trying to attack you for it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6581.639999999999s)]
*  so I see Bitcoin is having a good future, right? I think for all, there's a lot of good reasons. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6584.5199999999995s)]
*  I think Ethereum and some of the other ones are dependent on the applications built around them. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6589.4s)]
*  So like there's DeFi, which is as a real place so that people can easily trade, borrow loan money [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6593.639999999999s)]
*  and make some money or save, you know, borrow money. I think that's been around a while and [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6600.44s)]
*  that works okay, but it's kind of a stable app. But we really haven't seen that app. That's like [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6604.12s)]
*  the Instagram app, right? Like when, when iPhones first came out or the app store first came out, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6609.8s)]
*  right? There was no one app, right? Then Instagram came along, Snapchat came along, and then [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6616.12s)]
*  the app store blew up, right? There was apps, apps, apps, apps. We haven't seen that one app [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6621.32s)]
*  that everybody has to use. Yeah. Not for, yeah, for crypto. And when that happens, it'll make it [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6625.24s)]
*  a lot more common. Right. It's a great point. I really thought about that. What's something on [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6630.04s)]
*  the radars that nobody's seeing right now? People are talking about AI and Ozempic prices and, [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6634.2s)]
*  you know, women selling illegal Ozempic outside of vineyard vines and all kinds of stuff. Yeah, [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6639.56s)]
*  it's happening. And people are talking about the border and politics and, but what's something that [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6644.36s)]
*  you think it's on your radar? That's like a big issue that nobody's talking about. I think it's [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6649.32s)]
*  more AI than people realize. Yeah. Yeah. I think AI is going to go a lot further. I mean, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6653.48s)]
*  as processing speeds go like that and the capabilities of AI go like that, the context [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6659.4800000000005s)]
*  ones, all this other bullshit. Do you have a kid? I don't have any children. Oh, I thought you had one. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6664.52s)]
*  I will have one one day, but I don't have any. I gotta get a wife. Yeah. First things first, right? [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6669.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And so like, if you just had a kid tomorrow, let's just say, right? And you start collecting [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6673.0s)]
*  all the videos and pictures and things and over time it turns into emails and texts, you're going [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6680.040000000001s)]
*  to put that all in AI and your little kid when he's seven, eight years old is going to have, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6685.88s)]
*  you know, an invisible friend. That's an AI. It's some crazy shit that's going to happen. Oh, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6690.52s)]
*  because it'll be all the information you'd want him to know or whatever. Yeah, exactly right. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6695.16s)]
*  Right. And can talk to you when you're not there instead of them just going on Instagram or [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6699.08s)]
*  whatever Snapchat. It's going to be like, like you can be, so say you could take like a, say there [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6703.24s)]
*  was like an orb that went into your child's room, like an actual thing you plugged in, like a thing, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6708.12s)]
*  um, a fixture and you could load in through AI, like put in these 20 books, this orb should have [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6712.52s)]
*  this knowledge. Yeah. It wouldn't even be an orb. It'll be somebody that looks like a somebody. Oh, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6718.92s)]
*  that's what you were saying. So an actual figure could be an hologram of someone. And if my child [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6722.360000000001s)]
*  has any questions they can ask. And now fast forward 40 years where you're taking all the stuff about [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6727.64s)]
*  the child, right? And so now that information as well. So he'll know how to best relate to the [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6732.12s)]
*  child. Even if he remembers all every memory. And I remember when we were at the park, right? Or, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6736.28s)]
*  when was that time I went with dad to there it is right. And then when he hits 80 and dies or a [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6741.8s)]
*  hundred to say and dies, right? You've got that, that fake Joe, little Joey, right? Who just died [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6747.08s)]
*  and lives forever. It's going to be insane. So you'd be able to literally, as you're laying in bed [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6754.04s)]
*  at night, you could turn your grandparents on, on the wall through some sort of a projector machine [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6759.48s)]
*  and talk to them like they're still there. Wow. Or a hologram. Yeah. It's going to be insane. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6763.48s)]
*  Was there ever, I had an invention, dude, did you ever have an invention that you wanted to get [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6768.52s)]
*  done, but you never had the time? Not really. Cause I'm not that creative. Really? Yeah. I'm [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6772.04s)]
*  creative business wise, but what's your, what's yours? I used to think that they like 15 years [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6777.16s)]
*  ago, I started thinking, well, what if they had on your dashboard, you could put in something like [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6781.32s)]
*  a CD or something and on your dashboard, a hologram, the band would perform on your dashboard. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6785.4800000000005s)]
*  It'd be a little bit of a distraction, but it's cool. And you can make it over by the [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6791.08s)]
*  backseat or whatever. Yeah. But imagine if like a little boost. You can do that shit now. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6795.32s)]
*  You can do that shit. That was one thing I thought. And then I thought that they had a dog collars [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6800.2s)]
*  that, cause there's a dog that kind of howls behind my house a lot. If you could synchronize [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6804.599999999999s)]
*  them, you get the neighborhood or regional, you get them all the same collar and then they [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6810.36s)]
*  synchronize it and make some howl. So you put that together and come on Shark Tank then. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6814.92s)]
*  But like an organized, like, you know, they would do it like, so you know where he's at by the, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6820.28s)]
*  so that's cool. Right. So if you have like that dog and another dog down the street, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6825.08s)]
*  the collar would have them both howl at the same time. So you would have almost like the whole, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6828.44s)]
*  like a little symphony of dogs. That's funny as fuck. Yeah. If you can do that regionally. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6831.88s)]
*  So you say you're on the porch, you're relaxing with your wife, you're sitting there in the swing [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6835.72s)]
*  and you could just put program a little, you know, some Beethoven and then all the hounds [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6839.08s)]
*  started heating up. Yeah. Oh, that was a thought that I had right before you go. What's if there's [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6844.12s)]
*  a young guy who's out there, what's the, what's the best advice you would look back and honestly [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6850.44s)]
*  give yourself? I know it's such a generic question, but we have a lot of young men on, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6853.72s)]
*  on our podcast who are curious about what's something they can do to hedge their bets for [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6857.4800000000005s)]
*  the future and, and to best take care of themselves. Like, you know, fine. I think like I was the same [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6862.76s)]
*  way. Like you always think, oh, this is not the job, right? You know, this is not where I want to [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6869.72s)]
*  be. And I've got fired or quit or did a bunch of jobs. Right. And I think if I were going to do [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6874.12s)]
*  that again, I would try to be a lot. I try to be really good at all those jobs, right? Because [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6878.76s)]
*  a, when you get really good at something that opens up doors for you, right? Even if you're [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6885.0s)]
*  flipping burgers, right? If you're sweet, if you're the best at it, someone's going to recognize it. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6888.92s)]
*  Right. And if it's not the boss you have right there and then like dude fires you or whatever, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6893.320000000001s)]
*  you're going to, you're still going to be good for the next one. Right. And when you learn how [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6897.88s)]
*  to be good at something, then you can learn how to be good at other things. And then, because the [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6901.72s)]
*  hard part really is finding somebody you'd love to do that you can be great at, right? Because [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6906.36s)]
*  you never thought you'd be doing podcasting, right? No. And you're great at it, but once you [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6911.0s)]
*  find it, right, that's when the shit happens. Yeah. Yeah. It took me years to figure it out. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6914.44s)]
*  It takes all of us years to figure it out. Right. You know, I- Right. And give yourself some grace [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6918.92s)]
*  that you're figuring it out. Like- You don't have to figure out shit when you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6923.639999999999s)]
*  You don't know shit. Just don't get somebody pregnant and have fun. Right. Right. Right. Don't [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6927.96s)]
*  get thrown in jail. Get thrown. Yeah. Don't do shit that's going to, you know, hold you back. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6930.839999999999s)]
*  Right. But, you know, and then I'd add, be curious. Right. Because the more you learn, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6935.16s)]
*  the more doors open up for you. Be agile. Right. Be able to, you know, bob and weave when [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6941.88s)]
*  shit hits you. Right. Because it's going to, you know. And again, if you just can find something [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6949.0s)]
*  you can be really good at, no matter what it is, nobody quits anything they're really good at. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6955.08s)]
*  That's a great line. Because that's when you get the satisfaction. I'm the best motherfucking [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6960.36s)]
*  whatever it is. Right. And somebody's going to want to pay me because I'm the best. Yeah. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6965.24s)]
*  Yeah. And somebody will in a lot of, yeah, like, cause we have, once you start having employees, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6970.68s)]
*  you start looking for better employees in different spots. And then I bet it becomes a problem. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6974.76s)]
*  People trying to poach your employees. Has that ever happened? Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6978.84s)]
*  And you just got to, you know, try to connect with them better. And I mean, look, I'm horrible at [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6981.8s)]
*  hiring people. And so I always try to get somebody who's good at it. Cause I'm, I'm a softie, right? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6985.8s)]
*  Theo. Yeah. It's, you know, you, Theo sells me on why he wants to drive. You'll be great, Theo. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6991.08s)]
*  You know, I heard you say in an interview, one time you said, get on the job, learn it for three [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=6995.8s)]
*  months, do the, be the best fucking person at it. And then at six months, if you are the killer at [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7000.76s)]
*  it, it might've been a sales job, but go into your boss and say, I need a higher percentage. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7007.24s)]
*  Or I'm out. Or I'm out. And compete with you. Fuck yeah. Right. So you think it's a good strategy. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7011.64s)]
*  It's good. It's just good to have that mindset. If you work hard, you can something, you can figure [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7016.92s)]
*  it out. And if you can learn to sell, you always have a job. Oh, selling so hard. It's not though. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7021.88s)]
*  Like I was like, I started selling when I was like 12 years old. Oh yeah. Then you have it. Yeah. And [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7026.84s)]
*  I always looked at it at like, okay, I'm just trying to help somebody. Whatever, whatever I got. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7031.72s)]
*  Like I sold garbage bags door to door. I sold magazines. And I remember, you know, Theo, look, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7035.24s)]
*  I'm selling you this, all these five magazines for $10 a month. You know, when you tell your wife, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7040.28s)]
*  you spend $10 a month on the education and enjoyment of your entire family that puts them [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7045.32s)]
*  in the position to get better grades at school. You know, she's going to thank you for it. Yeah. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7050.84s)]
*  Sign that shit up. Right. So if you just look at it as helping somebody, that's a good point. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7055.72s)]
*  Yeah. That's a good point. If you don't think of it as I'm selling, if you believe in what you're [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7059.96s)]
*  selling to probably helps. Sure helps. Right. But you could, you should sell a full alphabet up to [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7062.76s)]
*  people in Pittsburgh, dude, because they're only using half of it up there. There's people up there [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7067.56s)]
*  only using half of it. Um, rumor, you wanted to buy Fox news. Is that going to happen? No, that was [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7074.2s)]
*  all bullshit. Right. So yeah, somebody asked me, um, um, if you could, would you buy extra, um, [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7078.28s)]
*  or Fox news? I'm like, I can't afford it, but if I could, I would, but yeah, I'm not trying. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7084.2s)]
*  Yeah. That's bullshit. There's, there's a rumor that you wanted to build an entire city in Dallas, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7088.599999999999s)]
*  like a new city from scratch. No, no, I bought a city. Oh, you bought a town called Mustang, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7093.8s)]
*  Texas. If you've got any ideas, Theo, bring them on. Really? You got a whole city over there. I got [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7097.8s)]
*  a whole town. It's not a city. It's a town. It's got like no people. Right. But it's like 75 square [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7101.08s)]
*  miles, um, or acres rather. And, um, I got a dude I played basketball with was dying of cancer. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7104.76s)]
*  And, um, said that his only real asset was this town. It's the only personally owned town in the [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7112.280000000001s)]
*  country, in the, um, in the state and one of the few in the country and like old, old friend. And [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7118.6s)]

*  One of my other basketball buddies is like the mayor and goes down there and keeps it up to date [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7130.12s)]
*  and everything. So if you've got any ideas and people live there, it's empty. No, it's pretty [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK6IWhDbWU&t=7134.04s)]
