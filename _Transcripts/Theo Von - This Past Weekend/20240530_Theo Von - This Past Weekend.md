*  You know, I mean, a lot of children, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=201.96s)]
*  really it goes from like breastfed to bottle fed, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=204.12s)]
*  to being fed by a woman like, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=208.52s)]
*  kind of vaguely covered in plastic, you know. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=210.64000000000001s)]

*  And so, it's kind of like, you know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=213.76s)]
*  it's almost mom's third breast in a way. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=218.24s)]
*  It's like, you're that next liaison [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=220.52s)]
*  to sustenance for a child, you know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=223.76s)]
*  True, true. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=225.6s)]
*  How did you get into the game? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  How did you get into it? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=228.2s)]

*  I graduated, got pregnant, needed a job and there I was. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=231.92s)]
*  And then it worked out really good, yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so let's just go back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=241.72s)]
*  So you graduated from what? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  I graduated from high school. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay, you graduated from high school and where are you? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=245.44s)]
*  What part of the nation are you in? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=248.88s)]
*  Okay, so you're from Ohio [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=251.92s)]
*  and you graduate from high school [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=253.48s)]
*  and then you get knocked up by a man. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=255.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=257.48s)]
*  You know, and then I didn't really want the man that much [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=258.32s)]
*  so then I moved out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  Oh, you moved out, so you separated. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  But how did that, so how did you go from there? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  How did somebody go from getting knocked up by a guy? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  I kind of wanted to. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=270.56s)]
*  To, you know, feed in children. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=272.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=274.16s)]
*  Well, I guess actually easily. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=275.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I fell into the job [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=275.82s)]
*  but when I started to do it, I was like, I really like it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=277.04s)]
*  And I had, and my son, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=281.8s)]
*  then he started going to school there, you know. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  So he got to stay when I was off, he was off. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=286.04s)]
*  So it was so much easier to, you know, follow with him. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  Oh, that's kind of perfect, huh? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  Oh, it was perfect, oh yeah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=294.44s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  So we would have the summers off if I wanted to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=297.36s)]
*  or, you know, whenever on holidays, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=300.16s)]
*  I didn't have to look for a babysitter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=301.92s)]
*  Oh, that's pretty magical, huh? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=304.76s)]
*  And how did you actually, who got you the job there? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=305.6s)]
*  Oh, I just went down to- Overseeing lunch. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=308.76s)]
*  I went down to the Board of Education, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=310.8s)]
*  looked around and got some jobs [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  and then I just slowly like moved up [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=314.12s)]
*  because I've been there so long, you know. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=316.2s)]
*  Oh, they move you, so there's different, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=317.8s)]
*  is there different- [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=319.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's kind of like different positions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=320.2s)]
*  Like you'd start out like the really kind of the lunch lady, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=321.92s)]
*  then you like move up to the general prep, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=325.24s)]
*  then the cook, then the manager, things like that, you know. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=328.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=331.36s)]
*  Okay, so you're in Cleveland, you have a child, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=333.24s)]
*  your child, now you start lunch ladying at the school [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  where your child is. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=339.64s)]
*  And so take me through like a typical shift [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=340.96s)]
*  of a lunch lady, like they get there, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=342.96s)]
*  do you walk to school, do you guys carpool, how does it work? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, I didn't have a car for a minute, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  so when I don't have a car, I would walk [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=352.68s)]
*  or sometimes somebody picked me up. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=354.68s)]
*  But I mean, I have a car now and we're actually in the, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  we're transitioning, they tore my school down, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=360.24s)]
*  so I'm over at a swing site. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=363.32s)]
*  So it's a little bit further, not too much further [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=365.32s)]
*  and I drive there and back. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=367.64s)]
*  But once I get the other one, really, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=370.0s)]
*  I can kind of walk down there if I had to. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=371.44s)]
*  Oh nice. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=373.92s)]
*  So it's been perfect since I also have anxiety, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=374.76s)]
*  I don't drive as much. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  Driving's hard, huh? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=378.48s)]
*  I don't like the other people driving. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=379.56s)]
*  If they could just stay away from me [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=382.64s)]
*  when I'm on the road, I'd be cool. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=383.84s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=385.4s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=386.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, well yeah, I mean, here's my thing, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=387.84s)]
*  I've met a lot of people, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=390.4s)]
*  Something's wrong with them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=392.28s)]
*  So all driving is is those people are in cars now. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=394.92s)]
*  Right, right, well. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=397.76s)]
*  So it's not like they've changed suddenly [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=398.6s)]
*  because they're in a vehicle, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  something's still wrong with them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=400.88s)]
*  I said just because I'm nervous [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=402.12s)]
*  and don't drive a lot like that, you know, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=403.36s)]
*  so them guys, you know, whew. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=405.12s)]
*  And I live in the lower Cleveland, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  so let me just say, some of the drivers [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  aren't even supposed to be in those cars. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=411.72s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because they stole them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=414.04s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=414.88s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=418.72s)]
*  Well about 15 years ago, I did wake up one morning [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  and my car got stolen out of my driveway [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  and I was like, dude, where's my car? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=424.16s)]
*  And it really wasn't there anymore. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=426.24s)]
*  But they never found it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=428.68s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=430.08s)]
*  So they must've, yeah, they probably took parts off it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  and had a good time with it, but I was violated. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=432.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=435.0s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=435.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, what kind of car was it? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=436.68s)]
*  It was an old Cutlass. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=440.52s)]

*  from lunch lady Melissa. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=461.67999999999995s)]
*  Do you know what year model it was, Melissa? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=463.96s)]
*  Oh goodness, I don't really remember that much. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=466.4s)]
*  But just ballpark it, like 1940, 1990? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=468.96s)]

*  and everything, but I didn't protect it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=484.56s)]
*  Should've put the club or something on the wheel, you know? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=487.48s)]
*  I got the club on it right now. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=489.32s)]

*  Is there an opportunity, if people want to smoke [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=671.88s)]
*  between lunch and break, like what is that, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  like you guys get a little break or anything, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=676.04s)]
*  do a video game on your phone or something? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=678.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, we're really busy, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=680.16s)]
*  so it all depends on what we're making that day, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=683.32s)]
*  because if it's something like hard, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=686.76s)]
*  like for breakfast we have to do all that, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  if it's just like a pancake we just heated up or something, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=692.44s)]
*  that's real easy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=695.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean, so you got more time, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=697.0s)]
*  but if it's something and I'm making sausage, egg, cheese, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=698.12s)]
*  I have to put it all on one, wrap it, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=700.72s)]
*  all this, no, we're swinging right in, you know? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=702.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=705.24s)]
*  As the kids are coming through, we're still, hey! [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=706.08s)]
*  You know, still working. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=707.64s)]

*  That's what I said. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=710.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=710.96s)]
*  And like when I do the turnover, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  people are like, wow, I'm like, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=713.1600000000001s)]
*  you move the color of her, we're turning over. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=715.24s)]
*  Breakfast is over. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  Ah! [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=718.6s)]
*  So really, is there a hard line [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=720.76s)]
*  where it's just like breakfast is done? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=722.32s)]
*  Well, I say that, but I'm lying, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  because whenever they come in, I also fill in breakfast, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=725.8000000000001s)]
*  even if they came in later, so. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=727.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  I always just tease. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=730.24s)]
*  You kind of draw a line in the same way. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=731.08s)]
*  Well, there should be a line, yeah, to at least a limit, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=732.2s)]
*  because I'm about to serve lunch pretty soon, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=734.9200000000001s)]

*  But like I said, we're here to feed them, so. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=739.2s)]
*  And is there like a little bit of a game plan before lunch? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=741.08s)]
*  How do you know what lunch y'all are gonna serve? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=743.84s)]

*  I have a menu, and then I order from the menu for the week. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, so like, what do you mean? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=756.72s)]
*  Like you have a menu? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=758.32s)]
*  Well, they say on the menu, okay, say it's a chicken bowl. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=759.44s)]
*  So I know I'm gonna order that, so for five days I order, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=762.76s)]
*  and I'll order everything for that, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=766.36s)]

*  we're gonna make for that same day. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=770.52s)]
*  Oh, so all the items that go into those things you're saying. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=772.56s)]
*  Because we have a couple different things you choose from. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=775.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=777.68s)]

*  boy, those kids are ready to get you, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=783.8s)]
*  and don't run out on pizza day. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=785.6s)]
*  Oh man, I was messing around once, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=786.76s)]
*  and I was talking to the kids too much, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=789.6s)]
*  and I started burning, so I'm like, I'm sorry, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=792.0s)]
*  I'm giving you a set of, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=794.0799999999999s)]

*  Yeah, if you run out on pizza day, I remember. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=798.92s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=800.8s)]
*  Well, we went through a couple different types of pizza, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=801.64s)]
*  I remember, I remember there was this round, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=804.16s)]
*  can you break up the different school pizzas [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=809.36s)]
*  that were served, there was a round pizza [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=810.96s)]
*  that had a great crust on it, I remember, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=813.0s)]
*  and it was really great, and people would like, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=815.04s)]
*  see each other and be like, hey, that crust is great, huh? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=817.36s)]
*  And people would be like, yeah. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=820.28s)]
*  And then we got to this other square pizza, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=821.8s)]
*  and I was like, this ain't even barely pizza, dude. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=825.88s)]
*  And that one, people didn't really like it as much, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=829.64s)]
*  and the cheese, I think, tasted different to me, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=833.24s)]
*  but yeah, let's look at a couple of these. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=835.88s)]
*  That's one right there, I've definitely had that one, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=839.44s)]
*  the one you have the cursor on, down right there. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=841.36s)]
*  Well, we have like, the one you got the cursor on, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=845.84s)]
*  that's like our breakfast pizza. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=847.84s)]

*  You got a plan. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=933.48s)]
*  Does the government tell you what the children have to eat, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=935.4s)]
*  or you can make it whatever? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=938.52s)]
*  No, the government kind of tells you [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=940.32s)]
*  what the kids need to have, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=941.72s)]
*  like how many servings of legumes, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=943.8s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=946.88s)]
*  There have to be certain things. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=947.7199999999999s)]
*  Legumes or whatever? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=948.88s)]
*  Yeah, like, you know, you have to have beans on there [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=949.8399999999999s)]
*  a certain amount of times, you know? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=952.12s)]
*  So yeah, they kind of tell you, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=955.4s)]
*  but we flip it around on different things, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=957.64s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=960.12s)]
*  If I'm short of that, they're getting that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=962.76s)]
*  So it is what it is. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=963.5999999999999s)]
*  As long as they eat, I'm happy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=965.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's my attitude too. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=967.3599999999999s)]
*  I can't believe children have a choice [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  where you're adding some of their meals. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=971.0799999999999s)]

*  Like I said, this guy, we make a chicken salad, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=974.72s)]
*  chef salad, and they love the PB&J still. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  You may give them just a cold lunch [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=980.72s)]
*  and then whatever we're making for hot. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=983.28s)]
*  So they pick between whichever one they want. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=985.3199999999999s)]
*  And are there days where there's a real specialty item? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=988.28s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1092.74s)]
*  A lot of people are just, don't know the difference [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1093.58s)]
*  between, yeah, condiments, silverware. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1095.54s)]
*  People don't know. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1098.7s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1099.54s)]
*  A lot of people get scared. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1100.3799999999999s)]
*  They had an emu the other day that died. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1101.22s)]

*  Oh my goodness. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1106.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1107.42s)]
*  So people will eat anything, I feel. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1108.24s)]
*  Can you bring that up? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1111.46s)]
*  You see it. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1112.3s)]
*  Let me know if you can find that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1113.1399999999999s)]
*  Is there a lot of lesbianism, like in the, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1116.42s)]
*  in the cafeteria culture, I feel like we had a lot of. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1118.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1121.5s)]
*  That was a good one. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1124.34s)]
*  Was that crazy? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1125.18s)]
*  We had a lot of female in, not inbreeding or whatever, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1126.18s)]
*  but like inbreding, I guess, basically. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1129.42s)]
*  Let's just say there's a little bit of everything. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1131.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1133.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1133.94s)]
*  We're going to say there's a little bit of everything. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1134.76s)]
*  We had a lot of women love or whatever they called it [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1136.06s)]
*  back in the day in the cafeteria. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1138.86s)]
*  You would see that a lot of people, some of them, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1143.22s)]
*  their husbands had been mean to them [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1146.6599999999999s)]
*  and then they would fall in love after that. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1148.26s)]
*  So it's like male induced lesbianism. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1150.26s)]
*  I get it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1154.82s)]

*  Oh, no. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1172.42s)]
*  A beloved ostrich at the Topeka Zoo [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1174.7s)]

*  And the ostrich is just, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1201.34s)]
*  the ostrich is just leaning on a cage door. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1203.18s)]
*  Like. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1207.7s)]
*  Different times. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1213.74s)]

*  I'm sorry. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1221.46s)]

*  and grabbed and swallowed the employee's keys. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1229.46s)]
*  Staff consulted with experts around the US [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1231.82s)]
*  to undergo surgical and nonsurgical efforts [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1233.86s)]
*  to minimize the impact of the keys. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1236.1s)]

*  Yeah, I guess you couldn't. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1242.74s)]
*  And I guess if you like to harm like an ostrich, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1243.98s)]
*  it was just, you can't get enough power in there. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1247.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1250.78s)]

*  If you'd have told me when I was a child [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1269.8999999999999s)]
*  that a cut of ostrich had come through, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1271.58s)]
*  I think there's some kids would have gone in and tried it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1273.1799999999998s)]
*  But I guess overall, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1275.98s)]
*  children don't like trying a lot of new stuff, huh? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1277.58s)]
*  No, they're so picky. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1279.5s)]
*  And I was like, you know, where's my hand? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1281.78s)]
*  I'm like, I didn't have that today, you know? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1284.86s)]
*  Yeah, kids are picky. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1287.02s)]
*  And mostly I remember they, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1288.62s)]
*  we would always sometimes get a McNugget, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1290.5s)]
*  which was pretty good. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1292.7s)]
*  They liked the nuggets. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1293.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1294.86s)]
*  They still like them, huh? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1295.7s)]
*  Oh, they love the chicken. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1296.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1297.3799999999999s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1298.22s)]
*  And what else would we get that was really good. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1299.06s)]
*  The pizza I enjoyed, I really did like the pizza [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1301.1s)]
*  till they switched it to that square pizza [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1304.02s)]
*  with no real crust on it. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1305.86s)]
*  And it just made me just so angry at everybody. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1307.26s)]
*  What else? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1311.94s)]
*  That straw in the milk bag they used to have, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1312.98s)]
*  did they still have that? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1315.42s)]
*  It was like a bag of milk? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1316.26s)]
*  No, they don't do the bags no more. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1317.26s)]
*  No. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1319.3s)]
*  Actually, we don't even do straws no more. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1320.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1322.02s)]
*  Yeah, he took away the straws and stuff for, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1322.86s)]
*  I guess we're gonna, you know, save it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1324.8999999999999s)]
*  How do you get the milk out of it into your body? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1326.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know what? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1329.1399999999999s)]
*  I thought there'd be more problems, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1330.3s)]
*  but they take that carton, just open it up and drink it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1331.66s)]
*  Oh. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1334.86s)]
*  And so I haven't had too much of a problem, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1335.7s)]
*  but when it first started, I kind of did think, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1337.3799999999999s)]
*  wow, there's gonna be a lot of you. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1339.06s)]

*  Yeah, they have the fruit, the vegetable stuff we do [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1925.3600000000001s)]
*  on the other side and they can pick all that up theirself. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1928.28s)]
*  I do like the main hot food. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1931.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1932.48s)]
*  For them, you know, and we can be asking what they want. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1933.32s)]
*  And so those are items like what? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1935.1200000000001s)]
*  Spaghetti. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1935.96s)]
*  Right. What else? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1937.08s)]
*  We have pasta and meatballs. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1938.68s)]
*  We have a chicken bowl [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1940.52s)]
*  where they have the mashed potatoes, the chicken, corn. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1943.2s)]
*  Okay. Like a chicken pot pie kind of? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1946.48s)]
*  Yeah, we started, we have like a Polish girl now. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1948.0s)]
*  It's like a turkey sausage kind of thing. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1951.0s)]
*  And you put the sweet potato fries and some slaw [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1954.28s)]
*  and some barbecue sauce on this sucker. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1957.2s)]
*  It's good. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1959.16s)]
*  I like it that day. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1960.6s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1961.96s)]
*  So I'm saying, I mean, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1963.32s)]
*  I've been eating the food all these years, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1964.92s)]
*  but I think they're getting better. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1966.48s)]
*  Yeah. They're getting a lot better. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1967.84s)]
*  Cause when I first started, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1968.96s)]
*  we just heated up microwave dinners. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1969.88s)]
*  I'll tell you. Really? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1972.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. We heated them up in the thing. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1973.6s)]
*  You couldn't cook food that was open. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1975.48s)]
*  So it looked like you cook like five fries. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1979.56s)]
*  I go fries are all stuck in the bottom. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1982.16s)]
*  And I mean the quality, like I said, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1984.24s)]
*  and then you make a hamburger with a bun already on it [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1987.8s)]
*  and heat it up in a plastic. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1990.24s)]
*  What is it? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1991.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1992.76s)]
*  So now we're doing like, we'll do the burger [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1993.6s)]
*  and we cook it and really cook it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1995.64s)]
*  And the fries go in the oven and they get crispy. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=1997.32s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2000.76s)]
*  So yeah, like I said, I've seen a big change. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2001.6s)]
*  Really? And how long has that change period [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2006.24s)]
*  been over you think? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, it's been about, I'm going to say about eight years [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2008.52s)]
*  of them slowly changing it, but this year has been the top [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2012.56s)]
*  because like the kids get a cantaloupe, watermelon, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2017.1999999999998s)]
*  whatever that I cut it up. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2022.08s)]
*  And we get them like going to Hawaii or something. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2023.56s)]
*  Oh man, the big kids, I have to slow them down. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2025.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, man, that's too many portions. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2027.8s)]
*  Cause I mean, they'll take the whole thing, you know? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  They probably didn't get all that good food. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2033.8000000000002s)]
*  And now we get tangerines instead of oranges, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2036.52s)]
*  which is really cool. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2038.44s)]
*  Cause you get those little cuties, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2039.28s)]
*  you can peel those and suck it. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2040.72s)]
*  So I don't even have to cut up those oranges. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2042.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2044.76s)]
*  Those cuties, it's almost like having a little date almost. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh man, they are. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2048.12s)]
*  But I have to stop, the kids like them so much. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2049.2400000000002s)]
*  They're in their pockets. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2051.12s)]
*  They got to remember, my only cuties you got. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2052.28s)]
*  Yeah, they don't care. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2056.92s)]
*  Okay, so you got the line. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2059.76s)]
*  Y'all got it going pretty good. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2061.2400000000002s)]

*  or have come through your line over the years? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2064.4s)]
*  Cause how many years have you been in the game basically? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2066.04s)]
*  31. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2068.04s)]
*  31 years. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2068.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm finishing my 31, yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2070.04s)]
*  Wow, you're like Glover Teixeira. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2071.4s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2073.28s)]

*  So. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2454.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, is there like a- [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2455.6s)]

*  it's like we know each other, we grew up. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2457.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2460.2799999999997s)]
*  We're family, you know. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2461.12s)]
*  Was it sad to see your son graduate, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2462.72s)]
*  like get out of this, like was when he left your school? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2464.6s)]
*  Yeah, I was very, yeah, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2467.64s)]
*  because I got to keep a very close eye on him. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2469.4s)]
*  Then he thought he was gonna get away with something, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2472.88s)]
*  but I told him I'll transfer. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2474.1600000000003s)]
*  I'll follow you, boy. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2476.0s)]
*  And he's like, no, mom, no. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2477.56s)]
*  So he did better. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2479.08s)]
*  But then when I would go to parent conference [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2481.2000000000003s)]
*  and I would start talking, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2483.2000000000003s)]
*  the teachers would look like, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2485.6800000000003s)]
*  no wonder that's where he gets it, listen to her. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2488.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm a hyper talking to him. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2490.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, how's my kid doing? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2492.84s)]
*  They're like, well, he's great, I guess. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2494.12s)]

*  Like we're gonna put you in detention. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2499.44s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2500.28s)]
*  Hey, when I first started working at school, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2501.28s)]
*  I thought, man, did I get called to the office? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2503.08s)]
*  I thought I was going to detention. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2505.6800000000003s)]
*  I was really working there. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2507.44s)]
*  And they would call you down there? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2508.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2510.2000000000003s)]
*  Just to tone it down? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2511.04s)]
*  Yeah, she jokes all the time and says [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2511.88s)]
*  that I'm gonna have to go outside if I laugh too hard. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2514.76s)]
*  Because during testing, you're supposed to be quiet. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2517.6s)]
*  Sometimes she's just like, I heard you. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2519.88s)]
*  I'm like, sorry. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2522.0s)]
*  But they all like it, so it's cool. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2523.08s)]
*  Sometimes you hear a helper, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2524.48s)]
*  so I'll be just like, ah, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2525.6800000000003s)]
*  and that's all the way upstairs calling [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2527.2400000000002s)]
*  and I don't realize it goes around the school. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2529.6400000000003s)]
*  But they know it's me. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2531.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's it, huh? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2532.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like a bird almost that you hear. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2534.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2536.6800000000003s)]

*  Around Valentine's or some kids seem kind of lonely [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2542.48s)]
*  or anything, does that ever happen? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2545.2000000000003s)]
*  A little bit, but they give those little hearts out [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2546.84s)]
*  and they give candy and the bigger kids will give flowers. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2549.88s)]
*  It's just, yeah, they make a big, and we have dances. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2554.1200000000003s)]

*  Yeah, most of the cafeteria is like [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2560.5600000000004s)]
*  where we have all our dances and everything. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2562.8s)]
*  And I'm right there, so I like to dance with the kids. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2564.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2567.2400000000002s)]

*  Sure. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2577.36s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2578.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2579.04s)]
*  I remember one time we had a guy named Mr. John [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2579.88s)]
*  and his wife, I think was a teacher. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2582.8s)]
*  I don't know if she was the teacher, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2584.96s)]
*  she just was the smartest person in our area [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2586.04s)]
*  and she would hang out at the school. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2589.48s)]
*  But she, I got to dance with her one time at a dance. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2590.56s)]
*  Aw. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2595.2s)]
*  It was pretty cool, I remember. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2596.04s)]
*  Well, my principals were great with a lot of things [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2596.88s)]
*  that she does and we have a mother-son dance [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2599.8s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2602.44s)]
*  So I had some buddies a long time ago [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2603.52s)]
*  and they didn't have a mom, so I went to the dance room, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2605.68s)]
*  danced with them. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2607.96s)]
*  Oh, that's sweet. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2609.0s)]
*  And everything, yeah, they were my buddies [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2609.84s)]
*  because we do a buddy breakfast thing. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2611.88s)]
*  Oh, you all do? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2613.84s)]
*  So I picked them as my buddy, yeah. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2614.68s)]
*  Oh, just students? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2616.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2617.3999999999996s)]
*  You kind of get close to some, if you see somebody [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2618.24s)]
*  and they'll say, you want to be my buddy? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2620.24s)]
*  And then you're kind of like their friend, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2622.2s)]
*  they could talk to you if they're having a hard day [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2623.8399999999997s)]

*  Oh, it's important? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2628.6s)]
*  Yep, and then a couple times a year we eat with them, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2629.4399999999996s)]
*  talk about, give them a present. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2632.7599999999998s)]

*  Really cool, yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2635.48s)]
*  But yeah, what are some other moments like? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2637.52s)]
*  Have you had some unique interactions? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2640.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, like Halloween. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2642.3599999999997s)]
*  I like to dress up in different stuff [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2644.4s)]
*  and then I run through the crowd. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2646.84s)]
*  And the little kids this year, I was this blow up [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2648.84s)]
*  and it blew up big too, it was cool. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2652.36s)]
*  So I run out and everything, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2654.76s)]
*  but then they kept kind of squeeze me [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2656.1600000000003s)]
*  and I'm like, I'm gonna pop, you know? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2658.2000000000003s)]
*  So I'm trying to get them away, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2661.48s)]
*  but I can't because it keeps blowing up. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2662.32s)]
*  So we do funny stuff like that. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2665.28s)]
*  And I, a couple of times, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2667.52s)]
*  I would tutor with the kids, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2672.16s)]
*  help the little ones with math or something. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2674.8399999999997s)]
*  Like whatever she asked, like we tried to do. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2678.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2681.56s)]
*  I think we're like a mixture, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2682.48s)]
*  when they're away from their home, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2683.8799999999997s)]
*  we could be their mom, their grandma, whatever, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2686.0s)]
*  if they're crying, you wanna go over [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2689.0s)]
*  and make sure they're all right, see what they want. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2690.7999999999997s)]
*  You have kids that'll chase you and hug you every day. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2693.64s)]
*  Sometimes you gotta run. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2695.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2697.08s)]

*  I'm like, here she comes. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2699.48s)]
*  And everybody laughs because she's so beautiful and sweet, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2700.72s)]
*  but she drives us crazy and she won't leave me alone. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2703.0s)]

*  Then I have my own and I'm like, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2963.52s)]
*  everybody kept saying, you're going to have another one. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2967.32s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2968.52s)]

*  That was it shut down. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2974.4s)]
*  That was it shut that all down. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2975.2400000000002s)]
*  Lunch line was over. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2976.44s)]
*  I got 600 kids a day. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2977.56s)]

*  Hey, every now and then you got to open it up [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2981.88s)]
*  for breakfast every now and then. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2984.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, yeah, but see, I don't have to have it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2985.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2987.96s)]
*  So that doesn't make it easy now. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2988.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2990.52s)]
*  Do kids, let me get into the financial of it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2992.52s)]
*  Do children pay for school lunch a little bit? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2994.4s)]
*  A long time ago when I started, I'm going to say- [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2996.52s)]
*  We had X and Y tickets. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=2998.96s)]
*  I remember. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3000.32s)]
*  About 20 years ago, they did. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3001.1600000000003s)]
*  We had X and Y tickets. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3002.1600000000003s)]
*  They were- [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3003.2400000000002s)]
*  X was full paid and Y was- [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3004.0800000000004s)]
*  Full paid, you got it. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3004.92s)]
*  Free lunch. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3006.1600000000003s)]
*  You got it. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3007.0s)]
*  Or partial pay. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3007.84s)]
*  So yeah, they had the full, partial and free. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3008.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, we had full, dude, I remember. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3011.36s)]
*  So I would get to school. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3013.32s)]
*  God, dude, it was the most, this was like one of the skit. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3015.1600000000003s)]
*  This was like one of the tougher things I think. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3018.04s)]
*  When you were a kid, like, yeah, you would get there [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3020.44s)]
*  and see if you can bring up the, yeah, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3023.6s)]
*  the school on tickets, keep looking for them. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3026.0s)]
*  Mine looked a little bit different. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3027.44s)]
*  Oh my goodness, like those lunch hearts. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3030.36s)]
*  Keep looking to see if you find some other ones. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3032.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, right there, the red and blue, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3034.72s)]
*  the whole mix of all of them, like the game tickets. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3036.2799999999997s)]
*  Those are the ones we had. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3038.4s)]
*  Right there? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3039.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3040.08s)]
*  And so you get up to the lady, right? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3040.92s)]
*  There'd be the lunch lady. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3042.16s)]
*  Cause they didn't allow men to do it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3043.16s)]
*  Cause I don't believe men should do it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3044.92s)]
*  We got a couple men in the system now. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3046.28s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3048.6800000000003s)]
*  We'll talk about that some other time. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3049.52s)]
*  Times have changed, yeah. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3050.36s)]
*  But we would get in there and you had to go up to her [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3052.7200000000003s)]
*  and you had to tell her if you were, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3056.4s)]
*  if you paid, you had to just buy the ticket from her. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3058.8s)]
*  And if you were free, you had to tell her you were free. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3061.92s)]
*  And I was just, it always felt so embarrassing [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3064.92s)]
*  cause I'd always be like another kid right behind you [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3067.0s)]
*  or in front of you. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3068.7200000000003s)]
*  She'd always say it like, oh, I'm free, you know. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3069.7200000000003s)]
*  And if the bus got there early, you could get breakfast. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3071.6000000000004s)]
*  That was the thing. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3073.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3074.8s)]
*  Based on how Ms. Hazel was doing [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3075.64s)]
*  and bless her heart or whatever, she's alive or not. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3077.96s)]
*  Hopefully she's alive, but she might not be. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3080.4s)]
*  But she was awesome. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3082.7599999999998s)]
*  But she, sometimes she would lollygag. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3084.68s)]
*  Sometimes she would stop or drive slow and smoke. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3087.24s)]
*  And so we would get there a few minutes later [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3090.2s)]
*  and we would miss breakfast. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3092.16s)]
*  And then you were just beside yourself. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3094.3199999999997s)]
*  You didn't even, you know, cause you had to get [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3096.48s)]
*  all the way to like 11. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3097.7599999999998s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3098.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what, right. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3099.68s)]
*  And you would just keep going to the water fountain [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3101.52s)]
*  and just drinking that much water. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3103.3599999999997s)]
*  As much water as you could. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3106.32s)]
*  And yeah, and I remember even one of my teachers [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3107.64s)]
*  would be like, go get you some of that [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3110.2400000000002s)]
*  breakfast water out there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3111.08s)]
*  Breakfast water. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3112.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they used to say. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3113.36s)]
*  Ms. Smith would always say that. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3114.28s)]
*  But anyway, yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3115.8s)]
*  And then at lunch, I don't know if we got our tickets [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3116.64s)]
*  in advance for the week or if you had to go [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3118.64s)]
*  and do the same thing at lunch. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3120.52s)]
*  But you would always try to sneakily say, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3123.48s)]
*  yeah, free lunch or whatever, you know. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3125.12s)]
*  I'll take a Y one or just something like that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3126.64s)]
*  Or I would try to pretend like I was giving them money. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3128.4s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3130.44s)]
*  It was like I was a magician. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3131.28s)]
*  Just cause I did it with other kids. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3132.88s)]
*  Cause you know kids get so embarrassed. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3134.44s)]
*  No, they do, yeah. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3136.2400000000002s)]
*  But then once you got the ticket, yeah, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3137.48s)]
*  and you were free to the line, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3139.08s)]
*  usually you would get a tray or like a little carton. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3140.56s)]
*  Like a little plastic kind of little carton. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3143.76s)]
*  And then you would go to like to the milk [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3146.6s)]
*  or beverage area first, get that. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3148.08s)]
*  Then you would go into the room where the actual kitchen was [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3149.96s)]
*  and you would have the line there. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3154.16s)]
*  You would get your line items come out. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3155.64s)]
*  And then that was it. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3157.8s)]
*  You was free to go sit down and eat. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3159.36s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3162.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was like the best thing ever, dude. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3164.08s)]
*  What is the funnest thing to serve to the kids? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3166.32s)]
*  Is there something you really enjoy? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3169.2s)]
*  I like to serve the pizza cause it's one piece. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3170.92s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3173.12s)]
*  Cause I can throw the pizza. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3175.52s)]
*  But when I got like mashed potatoes, corn, chicken, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3178.08s)]
*  a raw, you know, I'm sorry. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3181.0s)]

*  It's too much, huh? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3184.28s)]
*  And everybody, yeah, everybody's picky. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3185.12s)]
*  So they don't want gravy, so I'm on gravy. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3186.68s)]
*  You know, it's like. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3189.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3190.32s)]
*  And now they're like allowed to pick what they want. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3191.16s)]
*  We used to give them all of it, so. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3193.36s)]
*  Oh, they used to, yeah, that's crazy. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3194.84s)]

*  We would have to get whatever. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3197.08s)]

*  Yep, before and after. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3519.4s)]
*  We give them switch, like we got 20 minutes to 20 minutes, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3520.8s)]

*  or something that happened where there was just [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3537.0s)]
*  food people got sick from that day? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3538.68s)]

*  we did have this problem and there was flu going around [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3549.12s)]
*  and everything and a couple kids came in the lunchroom [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3552.3199999999997s)]
*  and they threw up. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3554.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, that started the other kids looking at them doing it. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3555.96s)]
*  Next thing I know, they call, they got buses [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3559.3199999999997s)]

*  Really? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3571.1200000000003s)]
*  Like you were witch, like the Salem witchcraft. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3571.96s)]
*  I had parents saying, don't eat that. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3573.96s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, yes. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3575.36s)]
*  And then the, what was that? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3577.36s)]

*  Yeah, I swear. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3587.84s)]

*  What'd you do? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3589.52s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3590.36s)]
*  And they wrote this article and then, I don't know, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3591.2000000000003s)]
*  a couple of weeks later when they realized [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3592.1200000000003s)]
*  that they wrote this little thing, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3593.6800000000003s)]
*  like it wasn't food, they were sick. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3595.04s)]
*  But they made me like look. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3597.56s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3599.24s)]
*  And then at the downtown would be like, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3600.08s)]
*  and Melissa, tell them about that. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3601.4s)]

*  How could you bring this up? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3605.6s)]
*  Like you were Hester Prandt or something, huh? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3608.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm so glad that those kids are probably long gone [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3609.52s)]
*  out of it by now. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3611.84s)]
*  Because that stuck with me for a little while. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3613.16s)]
*  Yeah, a little PTSD from that. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3614.88s)]
*  I'd be walking down the street and yeah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3616.2s)]
*  And all of a sudden they'll be like, there she is! [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3618.12s)]

*  You should have made t-shirts. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3639.4s)]
*  That said, I survived the macaroni of 2001. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3640.76s)]
*  I know, that would have been a good one. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3643.5600000000004s)]
*  That would have been. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3645.48s)]
*  People forget that there's a marketing possibility [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3646.48s)]
*  even within famine and disease. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3648.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3652.36s)]

*  Yeah, because we would have, people would get, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3656.52s)]
*  we'd have bad milk come through [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3660.64s)]
*  or bad cattle would come through town. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3662.08s)]
*  Sometimes they're, you know. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3663.8s)]

*  It could have been that the truck was parked overnight [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3668.12s)]
*  next to like a something that was heating it up. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3671.12s)]

*  like the cartons, they didn't fill it up. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3689.6s)]
*  They kept saying, why is it all these kids [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3692.52s)]
*  want another milk until I figured out [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3693.64s)]

*  And then it comes down to it. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3765.0s)]
*  And it never happened. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3765.8399999999997s)]
*  I think it was more of, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3767.2s)]
*  wasn't there a movie that there was a food fight in? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3768.56s)]

*  What was that movie that had a food fight in it? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3772.92s)]
*  It was a 90s movie. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3776.4s)]

*  So that's, I think it's so funny. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3792.16s)]
*  A lot of times you take something right back to like [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3794.28s)]
*  a popular movie or TV show, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3796.92s)]
*  and that's where it started. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3799.0s)]
*  Do you remember your lunch ladies from Vienna? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3801.4s)]
*  Not very many. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3806.52s)]
*  I don't think they were very nice then. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3808.12s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3809.7200000000003s)]
*  And one thing that I always said after I got in there [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3810.56s)]
*  was that I'm not gonna be like that. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3812.76s)]
*  Because, you know, we get a rap, you know? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3814.36s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3817.52s)]
*  Yeah, because some people are, you know, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3818.36s)]

*  You can only have one ketchup! [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3824.12s)]
*  And I always thought I'm gonna be like the cool one. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3825.6s)]
*  So then I am. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3829.92s)]
*  So then I think it works out. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3830.76s)]
*  Because I don't remember too many, you know, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3833.4s)]

*  But other people in there are teachers and stuff, you know. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3909.88s)]
*  I won't get involved. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3913.68s)]
*  You won't get involved? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3914.64s)]
*  No. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3915.52s)]
*  Do the teachers, is there a good relationship [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3917.32s)]
*  with teachers and lunch women or lunch women and now men [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3919.32s)]
*  because men are attacking the industry? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3922.96s)]
*  But is there a lot of good, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3925.16s)]
*  or are they arch nemeses of each other? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3928.28s)]

*  between lunch people and teachers? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3932.16s)]
*  I never thought about that. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3935.0s)]
*  At different schools, it'd be different. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3935.88s)]
*  But for me, I've got along with most of them [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3938.16s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3941.32s)]
*  And I have a good relationship with them, you know, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3942.4s)]
*  because everybody wants a milk every once in a while. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3946.76s)]
*  It's not mine, you know. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3949.6800000000003s)]
*  I guess it depends on who it is. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3952.28s)]
*  That's a powerful statement, everybody wants some milk. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3953.44s)]
*  You know, because they do. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=3955.36s)]

*  So how does that break down? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4047.2s)]
*  Well, the field trips and stuff, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4048.72s)]

*  When I make it, it's like a sandwich, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4054.16s)]
*  a PB and J sandwich on crustable. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4056.24s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4058.3999999999996s)]

*  And I get strawberry and grape and I kinda like them too. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4062.16s)]
*  So if I'm. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4063.84s)]
*  Y'all will make those yourselves? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4064.68s)]
*  No, they come. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4066.2400000000002s)]
*  You order from uncrustables? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4067.36s)]
*  No, we order those, yeah. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4068.2s)]
*  Wow, that's nice. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4069.04s)]
*  Yeah, those things are pretty good. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4069.88s)]
*  But then I'll make a bag with those [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4071.08s)]
*  and some goldfish crackers, a string cheese, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4072.64s)]
*  applesauce and some carrots. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  Bam, there's our lunch. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4077.92s)]
*  Damn. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4079.08s)]
*  And they're out. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4079.92s)]
*  We got, I remember, meat sandwich with mustard. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4080.76s)]
*  Yep. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4084.0s)]
*  And sometimes you got extra mustard somehow. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4085.08s)]
*  I know, and that's, I know. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4087.2400000000002s)]
*  You're like, first of all, I'm a child. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4089.76s)]
*  I don't eat mustard the first time. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4092.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm a child. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4094.6400000000003s)]
*  And now I get a lot of mustard. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4095.48s)]
*  Mustard is for polis adults. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4096.320000000001s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4099.16s)]
*  So there's no reason I should have to eat it. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4103.0s)]
*  I know, right? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4106.12s)]
*  And then you gave me more mustard. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4107.84s)]
*  So that would be scary. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4110.0s)]
*  You'd always see that one kid [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4111.64s)]
*  that would end up being an alcoholic [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4112.6s)]
*  and he'd be over there just eating the mustard. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4113.6s)]
*  Oh, you know what? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4115.2s)]
*  We got him with the hot sauce. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4116.24s)]
*  Y'all got hot sauce? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4117.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, now we give hot sauce. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4119.4800000000005s)]
*  And the kids love hot sauce. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4120.320000000001s)]
*  But I catch the little ones over there with the packs. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4121.56s)]
*  Was he eating it? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4124.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, what is it? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4125.240000000001s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4126.08s)]
*  Or they're keeping it in the pack. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4127.320000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna take this home to my dad [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4128.320000000001s)]
*  if he wants some hot sauce. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4129.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4130.320000000001s)]
*  For Christmas or whatever, that's crazy. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4131.88s)]
*  Hey, you know, they ain't got no sauce. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4133.92s)]
*  No sauce. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4136.08s)]
*  No sauce. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4136.92s)]
*  No sauce. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4137.76s)]
*  But so you pack those, you send them out on the field trip. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4140.4400000000005s)]
*  When do you pack those? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4142.52s)]
*  The night before you pack them, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4143.360000000001s)]
*  then the morning of the field trip? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4144.4400000000005s)]
*  I get everything ready except for the sandwich. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4145.280000000001s)]
*  And then in the morning, I just throw the milk in a cooler. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4148.8s)]
*  How many of you ever first go in? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4151.08s)]
*  And then put the sandwich in there [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4152.4s)]
*  and it thaws through the day so they can eat it [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4154.12s)]
*  by lunchtime. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4156.44s)]
*  Because you don't wanna leave those out too long [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4158.12s)]
*  because one thing is nasty is like the next day. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4159.679999999999s)]
*  It gets like hard or the jelly starts to go, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4163.639999999999s)]
*  seeping through. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4166.48s)]
*  So that very first day when it first just thaws, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4168.599999999999s)]
*  it's the best. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4171.679999999999s)]
*  So you guys will put the, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4172.84s)]

*  For the crust? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4175.24s)]
*  Yeah, I use those for the bag lunches. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4176.5199999999995s)]
*  For the bag lunches, right, the PB&Js. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4179.12s)]
*  And do they get a meat option in there or no meat option? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4181.32s)]
*  They used to but I haven't had one in a while. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4183.759999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4186.16s)]

*  Time goes really fast because I'm always busy. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4192.12s)]
*  I don't feel like it's a job, even though I'm getting paid [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4195.5199999999995s)]

*  I try to make my work fun. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4201.08s)]
*  And I make the ladies dance. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4203.2s)]
*  I tell them, okay, we're getting too serious, stop. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4205.2s)]
*  We put some music on, start to get the groove for a minute. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4208.24s)]
*  We all start laughing, doing dishes, just joking. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4212.16s)]
*  I told them I want this to feel comfortable. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4214.44s)]
*  I want us not to feel like, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4217.28s)]
*  just because we're working doesn't mean [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4219.5599999999995s)]
*  you can't have fun. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4220.72s)]

*  And then I like to act crazy around the principal [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4229.08s)]
*  or anybody because they all know me [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4232.32s)]
*  and they're like, there's Melissa, you know? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4234.12s)]

*  You know, one of the biggest things I think I would change, like I said, they're getting better. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4511.04s)]
*  But everybody eats the same portions. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4515.84s)]
*  I would give the bigger kids more portions. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4519.599999999999s)]
*  OK, I think like instead of that one chicken leg that everybody's getting, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4521.92s)]
*  besides, you know, the other stuff that they could get on the side, I'd give them two. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4525.6s)]
*  Yeah, I just think that the bigger kids are I mean, we got some big boys. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4528.92s)]
*  I mean, big girls, you know, and they're got to be hungry. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4533.0s)]
*  That's just not enough, I don't think, you know. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4537.0s)]
*  But I mean, we do have the salad bar. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4539.2s)]
*  They can fill up with that, but, you know, they want the they want the real deal. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4540.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. You know, so that's what I'm saying. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4543.24s)]
*  They want more of those. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4545.68s)]
*  So when I hook them up, they're like, no, it's OK. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4546.64s)]
*  I give them a couple more nuggets. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4548.52s)]
*  They're like, oh, you're my girl. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4549.64s)]
*  I'm like, I know I got you. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4551.48s)]
*  That feels good. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4553.32s)]
*  It does feel good. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4554.4s)]
*  It feels good when I see kids that I go places like to a wedding or something. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4555.52s)]
*  And I see all these kids are at the wedding because I had family friends. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4559.64s)]

*  God, it feels good. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4587.88s)]
*  It makes you rest easier. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4588.8s)]
*  Well, it does. It really does. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4590.0s)]
*  I know that's why I said some of the kids, you know, they're hungry. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4591.4800000000005s)]

*  OK. And then a lot of my [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4624.64s)]
*  friend's parents growing up were in the house cleaning and stuff. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4629.44s)]
*  And some of my Latino friends, their parents still clean houses. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4632.32s)]
*  I tried it for a minute. Did you? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4636.16s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, so you tried a business. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4637.72s)]

*  Nobody ever thinks about that. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4649.360000000001s)]
*  What do freaking lunch ladies do during the summer? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4650.68s)]
*  Oh, I was the last the year before because I got surgery last summer. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4653.6s)]

*  So it's not like this. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4660.68s)]
*  And why do you have to get surgery? Be honest. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4661.64s)]
*  It's just too much scooping. Oh, yeah. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4663.64s)]
*  They said repetitious movements. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=4665.52s)]

*  Oh, so you've worked at other schools in your own. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5006.84s)]
*  No, I've I've subbed, but I've went to other schools with her. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5009.56s)]
*  Oh, I see what it's like. Yeah. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5013.64s)]
*  See what it was like. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5015.64s)]
*  So lunch ladies will sub at another school. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5016.68s)]
*  Back in the day, they did. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5020.56s)]
*  But there was a point when I just stopped. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5022.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I have a home plate and I didn't have to do it no more. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5024.280000000001s)]
*  You know, that was for the other people. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5027.08s)]
*  So they still send subs and stuff, you know, around. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5029.320000000001s)]
*  But I quit subbing. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5031.56s)]
*  And do you get at a certain point, do you get a. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5033.6s)]
*  Pension to get a pension? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5037.240000000001s)]

*  It's like a retirement plan. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5041.4800000000005s)]
*  So as the IRS. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5044.240000000001s)]
*  How long does that take to build up? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5046.88s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5048.08s)]
*  Well, like, I've got 31, but my age. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5049.08s)]
*  So like when I'm 57, I have 35 years [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5053.56s)]
*  and I can retire with the full benefits and cheaper insurance, all that. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5056.6s)]
*  But my age is still there. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5060.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm not going to be 65. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5062.76s)]
*  So I couldn't get Medicaid and all that. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5064.48s)]
*  So there's a little because I started too early. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5067.839999999999s)]
*  But hopefully I could. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5071.16s)]
*  If as long as I'm healthy and running, I want to keep running. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5072.16s)]
*  You can keep working. Oh, yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5074.5599999999995s)]

*  What am I going to do at home? [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5077.12s)]

*  It's like I got to go. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5085.4s)]
*  Yeah. It's much better to talk to people than myself all the time. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5086.919999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5089.839999999999s)]
*  Did you ever try to go into your own business at any point? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5092.0s)]
*  Or do you like working with a group? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5094.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I like the group. I've never really tried. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5096.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5098.96s)]
*  Just didn't know if that was something that different people think about or not. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5100.32s)]
*  Or sometimes do. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5103.599999999999s)]
*  Well, if I could have thought of something, you know, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5104.4s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know what else I would be good at. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5106.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure I could have probably did something else. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5112.639999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I think I mean, it's smart and I liked other jobs. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5114.679999999999s)]
*  But, you know, this is where I've been. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5117.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So I think it makes me more happy to be around so many people. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5119.4s)]
*  That's what I was thinking, because doing your own thing [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5123.32s)]
*  can definitely be the other side of the tracks. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5125.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, you just really you can isolate a lot. Right. Right. Right. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5127.68s)]

*  Oh, a couple of times through the years. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5136.0s)]
*  I don't think a lot of principals, stuff wouldn't like let them, you know, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5138.8s)]
*  but I've had had fathers or something ask me something, you know, like angry [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5142.16s)]
*  about a soup or angry about a porridge or something. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5146.92s)]
*  My kid said that he didn't like that. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5149.28s)]
*  And you did something, you know, and it's like y'all serving bad land. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5153.12s)]
*  Right. You know, and I'm like, but not too many with me. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5156.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I even talked to a lot of parents because I've seen the kids so long. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5160.88s)]
*  Yeah. So I try to be friendly with all of them, explain if they ask me something. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5163.96s)]
*  But I don't try to get into too much riffraff because, you know, I live in the neighborhood. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5168.6s)]
*  Right. So you want to keep things right. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5172.5599999999995s)]

*  I notice in nature, a lot of animals will kind of like fatten up for winter or whatever. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5186.84s)]
*  Does that happen with children, too? Do you think? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5191.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I do. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5193.12s)]
*  I think that they eat and they get more in for it. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5195.32s)]
*  And the summertime, they're like wanting to run around so much out there. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5198.0s)]
*  I see that they eat less. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5201.12s)]
*  And I see their lunch. The garbage is heavier. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5203.16s)]
*  Oh, really? In the summer than it is in the winter. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5205.8s)]
*  I made a comment once and I'm like, wow, I noticed that. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5208.36s)]
*  Huh? Yeah, because they want to run outside, I think. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5211.639999999999s)]
*  And so you think in the summer, they're throwing more stuff away. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5214.04s)]
*  Whereas in the winter, they're eating it. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5216.44s)]
*  Because they want to. Yeah, I do. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5217.679999999999s)]

*  They're not going outside, you know, but when they're like [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5221.639999999999s)]

*  But, you know, that's a good point. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5232.92s)]
*  Some kids are like, oh, it's too much fun out there. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5234.08s)]

*  I was like, it's probably preservatives or something in it. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5461.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5463.96s)]
*  Oh, some of that's just natural. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5464.76s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, we have this egg roll that was really. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5466.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's been a couple of items that I would have been like, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5469.84s)]
*  no, and I eat everything. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5473.68s)]
*  I'm like, Mikey, and there's nothing I wouldn't eat. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5475.6s)]
*  You are. They had an egg roll, too, for a while. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5478.72s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, kids didn't really care for that egg roll. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5481.2s)]
*  So bizarre. Yeah. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5484.2s)]
*  I remember the bread they used to have. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5485.64s)]
*  So the bread was always made in one big pan, right? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5487.48s)]
*  It was like a whole pan full of rolls. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5490.12s)]
*  And ours always had this dust on them. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5492.12s)]
*  And people would be like, that's flour. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5494.24s)]
*  And I'd be like, it doesn't seem like flour. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5495.5599999999995s)]
*  It just seems like dust. Oh, that's true. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5497.64s)]
*  Yeah. So so we were wrapping our rolls and some of them will come like that, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5499.64s)]
*  you know, with a whole bunch of and I said, what is it like just flour? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5503.44s)]
*  That's a lot of flour on there. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5507.84s)]
*  And the kids will see it. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5509.72s)]
*  And I'm like, they're not going to believe it's flour. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5510.72s)]
*  I said, it looks gross. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5513.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't want to serve that one. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5515.0s)]
*  It's just flour. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5517.28s)]
*  We didn't believe. Exactly. That's terrible. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5518.64s)]
*  It's kind of like I'm trying to think of the ones. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5521.04s)]
*  Oh, we had a couple of these different ones. That one. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5523.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5525.88s)]
*  Can you look up [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5527.400000000001s)]
*  Dusty School Lunch Rolls? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5529.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5531.12s)]
*  Is that what he's looking up? Dusty School Lunch Rolls. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5533.6s)]
*  Lunch room. Yeah, maybe soft red rolls. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5537.4800000000005s)]
*  But, you know, I've had the kids tell me, let's look what's on this. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5540.6s)]
*  And I'm like, it's flour because that's what they tell me. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5544.8s)]
*  It's flour. I mean, it is flour. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5549.200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't seem like flour. It seems like science dust or something. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5550.84s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe you see dust. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5553.56s)]
*  Yeah, it could be some powder, some of these. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5556.76s)]
*  Some of that thought it would be like a powdered butter or something. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5558.320000000001s)]
*  Right. Or something. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5561.04s)]
*  But I could never figure it out. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5562.200000000001s)]
*  And they were never they never got the rolls really that good. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5563.8s)]
*  I didn't feel like. Yeah. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5567.12s)]
*  We get different rolls like and bread. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5569.52s)]
*  We order from different departments at different times. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5572.72s)]
*  We had swables once we had this. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5575.240000000001s)]
*  So the bread's not too bad, but you always find some that comes in, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5577.08s)]
*  like you just said, with a whole pile of dust. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5581.48s)]
*  I'd be like, was it a hamburger bun? It's covered. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5585.24s)]
*  And yeah, that's what I would be like. Look, all this white. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5588.16s)]
*  It was the hamburger buns. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5591.5599999999995s)]
*  A lot of times when they make them, they must just throw that flour at them [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5592.84s)]
*  after they pack them. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5595.88s)]
*  But it does look funny because people don't want to eat that, because, you know. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5597.64s)]
*  Yeah. And kids do make those comments. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5600.64s)]
*  They notice anything on the food, anything. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5602.4s)]
*  If it looks just a little strange or something, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5604.48s)]
*  they're going to make a comment on it. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5606.76s)]
*  You know, so. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5607.96s)]
*  But I hate to be like one of those, you know, just flower. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5609.52s)]
*  Because I feel like it's not. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5612.72s)]
*  I know. But I'm like, is it? Is it? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5614.6s)]
*  Did you guys ever serve sloppy Joe's ever? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5618.4400000000005s)]
*  We did. We haven't this year or whatever. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5621.4400000000005s)]
*  But there was years we did. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5624.04s)]
*  Some of the kids liked it. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5625.84s)]
*  We had a teacher there years ago, and he did a little skit with me on this. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5628.68s)]
*  Sloppy Joe's. Oh, yeah. About Adam Taylor. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5632.8s)]
*  Yeah. And I wore the white. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5635.68s)]
*  When I first started, they gave me that white dress and all that. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5638.4400000000005s)]
*  And you had to look. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5642.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You had to dress a certain way. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5643.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. But thank goodness that didn't last long for me. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5645.040000000001s)]
*  Pull up that outfit. We switch. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5647.92s)]
*  Yeah. Go on with that one. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5649.240000000001s)]
*  The lunch lady. White dress. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5650.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm young now, mine and I'm like, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5652.0s)]
*  look like with these loafers. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5654.56s)]
*  Oh, you wear the hair. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5658.280000000001s)]
*  Yes, I remember that. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5660.160000000001s)]
*  And I said, yes, is there something sneaker? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5661.6s)]
*  Exactly. Right. Right there. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5664.04s)]
*  That's what they gave me. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5667.12s)]
*  One of those white white. Wow. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5668.5199999999995s)]
*  And so we did a little skit or whatever. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5670.28s)]
*  It's around there somewhere on YouTube somewhere. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5673.84s)]
*  Who knows where it's at? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5675.88s)]
*  But I put a mole on and all that. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5677.32s)]
*  And we did a little bit of that. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5680.6s)]
*  Do sloppy Joe's. Yeah. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5681.88s)]
*  So it was fun. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5684.0s)]
*  But they never serve them anymore. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5685.32s)]
*  No, they haven't served sloppy Joe's for a long time. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5686.92s)]
*  And the kids seemed like it. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5688.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was the only place you could get it at was school. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5690.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5692.64s)]
*  And it was such a bizarre thing. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5693.52s)]
*  You were like, I don't even know what it is. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5694.84s)]
*  It's like it's magic meat. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5696.400000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, what it really is. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5697.76s)]
*  It's like it's not a hamburger. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5701.080000000001s)]
*  Are you sure is that we name them different things, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5703.120000000001s)]
*  but we just change a little. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5706.88s)]
*  Well, you could always kind of tell. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5710.280000000001s)]
*  Is there stuff that if there's leftovers on the first day, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5711.4800000000005s)]
*  then you'll use it in different recipes throughout the week? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5713.68s)]
*  Yeah. Huh? You don't want to waste. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5715.400000000001s)]
*  No, all hot foods got to be thrown. Oh, really? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5717.56s)]
*  Yeah. This is this is why you're like, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5720.320000000001s)]
*  if you're the manager, you have to know not to overcook too much [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  because they want to get it right. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5726.4s)]
*  But they like pasta and meatballs. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5729.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, those meatballs, boy. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5733.72s)]
*  They're hard to deal with. Yeah. For my hands. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5736.44s)]
*  They seem to want to just throw. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5739.72s)]
*  Then I start singing to the kids and I drop my poor meatball. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5741.24s)]
*  And you roll it from that song. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5743.92s)]
*  Yeah. What was it? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5746.12s)]
*  That was a book was it was a drop my poor meatball when somebody sneezed? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5747.96s)]
*  Rolled off the table and onto the floor. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5752.2s)]
*  Then my more meatball was out the door. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5754.24s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5757.360000000001s)]
*  We like to tease them and joke on top of spaghetti. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5758.96s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5761.4800000000005s)]
*  Sepagetti spaghetti. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5762.24s)]

*  God, who doesn't, though? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5773.84s)]
*  Right. I was just going to say who don't like cheese, you know? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5775.12s)]
*  And you got to put cheese on is good. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5777.72s)]
*  Yeah. So yeah, that's really the thing that everybody loves. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5779.2s)]
*  How big is your school these days? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5782.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, you're at the side school now. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5784.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'm at the side school, but we're doing six hundred. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5786.64s)]
*  But when we go back to this new one that they're building down the road for me, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5789.08s)]
*  it's going to be huge. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5793.0s)]
*  And then they're going to take to take and knock down the school down the road [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5794.320000000001s)]
*  and put two schools to one. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5799.320000000001s)]
*  So I should have over a thousand by then. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5800.92s)]
*  Wow. But hopefully I get more help, you know? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5803.04s)]
*  Yeah. The short staff name, what you want to hear. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5805.68s)]
*  That's true. And you've already had carpal tunnel. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5808.96s)]
*  You've already. You know, that's what I said. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5810.48s)]
*  I just keep going. Yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5812.04s)]
*  I'll figure it out. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5813.4s)]
*  You're like the Aaron Rodgers of the lunch lady. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5813.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know, right? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5815.839999999999s)]
*  You really are. Right. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5819.44s)]
*  But we need you back out there. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5820.719999999999s)]
*  What happened during the time off with the surgery? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5822.16s)]
*  Well, I did the summer. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5824.839999999999s)]
*  I didn't take off because I don't like to really miss work. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5826.08s)]
*  So I didn't take off. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5829.759999999999s)]
*  I just went and had the surgery right after [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5831.04s)]
*  we got out of school. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5834.2s)]
*  But then it wasn't really healing as good. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5835.919999999999s)]
*  I think I messed it up a little bit as I went back earlier. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5838.4s)]
*  You know, did you? Yeah, but it's all right. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5841.24s)]
*  You know, it's hard not to use your hands. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5843.48s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's hard. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5846.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, if I try, if you put it in, it's too hard. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5848.32s)]
*  So this is what I just got to shot. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5851.92s)]
*  Roosters do it or like chickens kind of do it. Right. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5853.04s)]
*  Yeah, if I could be like a chicken, I don't want to say they're dumb. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5857.2s)]
*  I don't know. A lot of them. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5859.599999999999s)]
*  Some of them are. I mean, a lot of them are. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5860.679999999999s)]
*  I don't want them to hear me say it. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5866.28s)]
*  I know. Right. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5867.56s)]
*  One of my chase. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5868.56s)]
*  We see chickens all the time. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5871.160000000001s)]
*  And I watched them cross the street and then come back. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5873.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. People got chickens everywhere. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5875.64s)]
*  Really by you. Yeah. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5877.64s)]
*  Huh. Wonder why. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5879.0s)]
*  I don't know for the eggs. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5881.160000000001s)]
*  I think I sell the eggs. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5882.72s)]
*  Maybe they're going to get a golden egg. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5885.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. My my sister has some chickens in her home, I think. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5886.88s)]
*  Or she did anyway. Some of them might have gotten out. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5891.200000000001s)]
*  What else? Anything in the news? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5894.64s)]
*  Let me think of something I was going to ask you about. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5896.2s)]
*  I'm still looking for floating gay witches. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5899.28s)]
*  Yeah, we look at gay. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5902.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5904.24s)]
*  Yes. Did you anything on that sinking gay witchcraft? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5905.96s)]
*  I found not the gay part, but the witch part you're spot on about. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5910.28s)]
*  He said not the gay part. Bring it up. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5914.48s)]
*  The ordeal usually involve the tying of a sus [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5916.72s)]
*  of a suspect's wrist to their ankles and then throwing the individual [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5919.76s)]
*  into a body of water with ropes attached. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5923.32s)]
*  Contrary to popular belief, if the suspect sank, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5925.68s)]
*  they were presumed innocent and hauled up. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5928.52s)]
*  It was not common for them to perish unless they did so accidentally. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5931.12s)]
*  Should they float, however, this was taken as confirmation [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5934.92s)]
*  of their alliance with the devil. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5937.84s)]
*  So you had to sink. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5940.240000000001s)]
*  So if you didn't know how to sink, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5941.4400000000005s)]
*  the premise of this ordeal was that it provoked direct intervention [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5943.6s)]
*  from God in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5946.72s)]
*  And the result was therefore seen as a revelation of God's judgment. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5949.92s)]
*  And you had to put something in your [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5953.160000000001s)]
*  make sure you're sinking. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5955.2s)]
*  You better eat a heavy lunch. You know something. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5956.32s)]
*  Well, I'm not a swim, so I'm sinking. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5959.32s)]
*  You better eat a heavy lunch. Right. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5962.2s)]
*  Anything else we need to know about the trade, about the lunch trade, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5964.44s)]
*  about the the industry, anything? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5967.2s)]
*  You said there was men infiltrating the business. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5970.36s)]
*  Is that there's a couple of men. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5972.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's working in the kitchens now. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5974.08s)]
*  And is that new? Is that? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5977.08s)]
*  No, I think they've been there for a minute. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5978.96s)]
*  I I've only worked with like one. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5980.599999999999s)]
*  And are these bisexual men or is it all types of men, you think? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5983.799999999999s)]
*  All types. Yeah. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5986.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, all types. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5988.48s)]
*  Everybody loves lunch, baby. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5990.08s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5991.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. I love it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5993.28s)]
*  I don't care if I love the men or women. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5994.96s)]
*  I would still make lunch for myself and others. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5996.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, me too. I don't care who it is. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=5998.4s)]
*  Yeah. Same here. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6000.4s)]
*  You gotta eat. Everybody's gotta eat. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6002.4s)]
*  That's what I tell them. You gotta eat. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6004.4s)]
*  You know that's what's for. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6006.4s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6009.4s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6011.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to think of anything else we want to learn about the industry. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6012.4s)]
*  We've learned who the kids come in. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6015.4s)]
*  We've learned that sometimes you have to step over and give them a hug [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6018.4s)]
*  if they're having a tough time. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6021.4s)]
*  We learned sometimes they bring cats and snakes through [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6023.4s)]
*  just because that's what's going on. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6026.4s)]
*  The food plant. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6029.4s)]
*  What about I know didn't they have Michelle Obama had a program a few years back? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6030.4s)]
*  Yeah, we got we got quite a few things dropped off and stuff. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6034.4s)]
*  And she gave a lot of stuff out to parents. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6038.4s)]
*  It was called Get Right. What was that program called? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6040.4s)]
*  It was the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6043.4s)]
*  Change nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program by requiring that schools serve more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fat free and or low fat milk more frequently and less starchy vegetables or foods high in sodium and trans fat. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6046.4s)]
*  Did that take effect? Did you actually see that happen in the school system? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6062.4s)]
*  Because a lot of things that politicians and you know, yes, she they really did that and they came out and gave boxes of the whole entire like meals to parents and stuff and told them how to do it with the spices, everything. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6067.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. And also they give them a bag of fruit each week to take home. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6084.4s)]
*  They have a lot of free fruit and vegetable program. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6090.4s)]
*  Then once a month we have a free like produce and everything outside. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6094.4s)]
*  So parents, everybody comes and gets it. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6100.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. So there's a lot of stuff from your school that's available for the community. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6103.4s)]
*  A lot that you guys don't use at school. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6107.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. Nothing to do with you. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6109.4s)]
*  Exactly. Wow. Yeah, it's amazing. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6111.4s)]
*  Yeah, like I said, there's always trucks dropping off that they put stuff in the kids' book bags for them to take them for a meal for the weekend. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6114.4s)]
*  So, yeah, your mom ever come over to the school and get a meal from you? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6122.4s)]
*  Well, I had my I had a step mom. Oh, you did. Oh, she passed away. Yeah, but I didn't like her food anyway. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6128.4s)]
*  You didn't know or her much, but it's cool. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6135.4s)]
*  I'll talk about that. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6139.4s)]
*  Hey, look, it's tough. Step moms are harder. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6141.4s)]
*  I am a real mom, but she's never came to school. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6143.4s)]

*  Parents. Yeah, they come in and they see stuff, but my principal and stuff feeds them. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6166.4s)]

*  So I have other food brought in for them and they'll eat. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6174.4s)]
*  Can a kid have a older brother or a family member come and have lunch with them at school one day or no? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6177.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Sure. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6183.4s)]
*  That happens a lot. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's cool. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6186.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's fun. We got a lot of yeah. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6189.4s)]

*  In the school system. In the school. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6195.4s)]
*  So there's nothing for that. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6198.4s)]
*  Do you guys ever do like pep rallies and stuff like that ever? What's that energy like? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6200.4s)]
*  Yeah, they well, they'll just start. Yeah, because we think we they could have high energy, you know, because we get rowdy. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6203.4s)]
*  And then when I hear them, I get rowdy. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6210.4s)]
*  So then I go running through the thing, you know, and make them clap. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6213.4s)]
*  And then the teacher like there's some little again, you know, so most of them kind of know that I'm going to do it. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6217.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6223.4s)]
*  You know, or like when they have to answer like here she comes. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6224.4s)]

*  Am I supposed to just sit here and work when I get I got to go over there? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6230.4s)]
*  Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to think. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6233.4s)]
*  Do you still feel like you're in school a little bit? Is there is. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6237.4s)]
*  Yeah. I'm like, I still feel like like I've never got out of school. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty cool. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6241.4s)]
*  It is kind of. Yeah. It's like. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6247.4s)]
*  And then it's funny because I talk to people and I'm like, yeah, I got to go to school, but really I'm going to work. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6249.4s)]
*  But they probably are thinking, man, she's the longest in school. Yeah. I never seen somebody in school so long. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6254.4s)]
*  Because I never say work. I just say, yeah, like, God, you think that she graduated, you know, they're breathing a day. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6258.4s)]
*  She's still in school. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6266.4s)]
*  Do you think some kids probably mostly eat at school and don't eat at home in your area? Yes. Really? A lot of them. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6268.4s)]
*  Yeah, we have children you wouldn't know from that are homeless and from everywhere and they go to school. No way. Oh, yeah. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6273.4s)]
*  Yeah. Is there homeless in your area? Yes. A lot. Wow. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6281.4s)]
*  That's crazy, huh? Yeah, definitely. Yeah, it's got different over the neighborhood, too. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6287.4s)]
*  You know, yeah. And lower and lower. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're seeing a lot of homeless with homelessness on the rise. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6293.4s)]
*  The Supreme Court weighs ban on sleeping outdoors. Oh, yeah. What is that going to do? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6298.4s)]
*  I love how they rephrase it to being sleeping outdoors. Pull this up a little bit more. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6303.4s)]
*  The Supreme Court wrestled with major questions about the growing issue of homelessness on Monday as it considered whether cities can punish people for sleeping outside when shelter space is lacking. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6309.4s)]
*  It's the most significant case before the high court in decades on the issue and comes as record numbers of people are without a permanent place to live in the United States. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6321.4s)]
*  What? So the case started on the case started in the rural Oregon town of Grants Pass, which began finding people two hundred ninety five. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6330.4s)]
*  They can't even pay for their homeless. They don't even have nowhere to go for sleeping outside as the cost of housing escalated and tents sprung up in the city's public parks. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6340.4s)]
*  That's unbelievable. Because, yeah, you're like, where are people supposed to go? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6348.4s)]
*  Well, they got a lot of they make a lot of spots over there, like tent city and stuff. Yeah. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6352.4s)]
*  So there's places that you see a lot of homeless. But I wonder if they would also have to. Is that considered sleeping outside? [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6357.4s)]
*  Yeah. And I couldn't see how how you're going to give them if you have a tent. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6363.4s)]
*  I feel like you're because if people don't have a place to go and they make a tent, right, then they're trying. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6367.4s)]
*  They're trying to make a home. Yeah. I mean, right. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6373.4s)]
*  Somebody's making a house, right? Yeah. And some rent is so expensive. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6376.4s)]
*  What do you expect someone to do? Oh, yeah. You know, especially if people get caught up on, you know, people get caught up in a drugs pretty easily. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6380.4s)]
*  Well, there is a lot of that going on now. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6387.4s)]
*  Especially when we advertise drugs on television in this country, like it's like it's a new toy. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6389.4s)]
*  Right. Right. You know, every single one. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6396.4s)]
*  So you can't be shocked when people end up on drugs and then now they're stuck outside. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6398.4s)]
*  And yeah, we don't have a place for them. Gosh, that's unbelievable. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6403.4s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine getting a ticket. Yeah. I'd be I'd be laughing at him. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6407.4s)]
*  What do you want me to do with this? I use it for white, you know, because I don't even have a job. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6412.4s)]
*  Where are you going to get to? Yeah. I'm like, hey, give me a whole give me a whole roll of tickets. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6419.4s)]
*  Right. Could you give me some more tickets? Right. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6425.4s)]
*  Hey, give me the soft ones. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6427.4s)]
*  What are they going to do? Put me in jail for a minute. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6429.4s)]
*  Then I have a home and I can go to the bathroom and get a meal. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6431.4s)]
*  I mean, if that's going to be. Gosh. Right. How rude. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6434.4s)]
*  Unbelievable. Or they'll probably make them start. They'll make schools start feeding the people maybe. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6439.4s)]
*  Did you ever try like a homeless feeding program at your school? Yes. Really? Yes. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6443.4s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, in 2020, when all of them was at home, I was out there with N95 mask and we made my custodian made me this drive through door because it was closed off. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6448.4s)]
*  Your custodian made it for you? Yeah. It was really cool when I come in. Yeah. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6459.4s)]
*  And so I could just was like, shh, but anybody come at the door and we would give them food. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6462.4s)]
*  So I gave a lot of food away around those couple of months. Yeah. Students and homeless people. Students, homeless people. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6468.4s)]
*  Anybody. Anybody and everybody. Yeah. You saw some crazy stuff. Did you? Oh, I mean, you know, but hey, at least it was free food. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6474.4s)]
*  There wasn't you. You wasn't hungry because there was lots of places to get free food from. Yeah. People got to eat. Yeah. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6484.4s)]
*  You know, I feel like if I put my glasses on, we look a little bit the same. You're a lot cuter though. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6490.4s)]
*  A little bit. I'm half Polish for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Holab. Yeah. Holab. Holab. Holab. Holab. We them boys. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6495.4s)]
*  What are some things you've ever heard kids say that have been funny? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6507.4s)]
*  Anything funny that comes out of your head over the years that are anything interesting or like because you're right there on the eavesdropping. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6513.4s)]
*  I know it's just like it's so hard to think of things at the time. I mean, I eavesdrop all the time. Don't get me wrong. Amen. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6519.4s)]
*  Because I hear stuff I'm not supposed to hear. I just I just try not to even, you know, I'm thinking they did what and they're only what. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6527.4s)]
*  So kids making out or whatever and different things that they talk to. And I'm like, oh, man, I don't even want to hear all that now. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6534.4s)]
*  So I try to act like I'm not listening. But like some will talk sometimes like a long time ago, maybe about their parents or get a little bit more scoop than you should know. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97Z17qxK9M&t=6543.4s)]
