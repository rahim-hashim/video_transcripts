*  And usually like I go to the site called Team Skeet. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=843.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? And they have like 95 percent. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=847.28s)]
*  That's a pretty good number. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=849.76s)]
*  And I'll go through and I'll jerk off to the one that has the lowest number. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=851.16s)]
*  Because I feel bad. Really? Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=854.3199999999999s)]

*  I can't ejaculate if somebody's having trouble breathing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=878.24s)]
*  No, I think the numbers are based on or the rating is based on [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  if how the girl performs. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=883.84s)]
*  And usually if the rating, if they're hot and the rating is low, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=886.4s)]
*  it means that they're like there's one girl that was just literally not there. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=890.28s)]

*  Oh, OK. Yeah. Like a dark alley or something. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=1710.36s)]
*  Maybe it could involve that, you know, I mean, but like, you know, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=1714.1999999999998s)]

*  Of girls sleeping outside his hotel now. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3521.92s)]

*  Mm hmm. Right. Give this to Henry. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3528.36s)]
*  Right. And I go, I don't think he likes rice cakes. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3530.6800000000003s)]
*  I think he likes pussy cakes. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3533.8s)]
*  You know, it's like if you have a pussy cake, you mean, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3536.88s)]

*  Wow. And I'd be like, people just live there. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3547.92s)]
*  And the kind of power. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3550.6s)]
*  And I made the very big mistake of so it was a movie I did with this guy. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3551.72s)]
*  Right. And so I get a call going, we're doing a press conference in L.A. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3555.6s)]
*  So it was like, I'm not kidding you, a thousand kids, mostly white. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3560.48s)]

*  Oh, yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3585.64s)]
*  I knew what was going to happen. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3587.0s)]
*  If they said Bobby Lee, I would get cheers. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3587.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Not a lot, but some. Right. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3591.64s)]

*  It went, Henry Lau. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3597.72s)]
*  And when they said Bobby Lee, you couldn't hear it because of the fucking noise. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3601.16s)]
*  So I walked out and I got the residual of his claps. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3605.6s)]
*  It was fucking embarrassing, dude. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3610.08s)]
*  Damn. Yeah, it was terrible. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3612.16s)]

*  And powerful. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3623.92s)]
*  Why do Koreans why are they so why do they get so do they do? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3625.12s)]
*  Koreans get more obsessed with pop icons than Americans do. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3630.4s)]
*  Yeah, but they're only obsessed with pop. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3635.44s)]
*  Right. Like Billie Eilish, you know, Harry Styles. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3638.16s)]
*  But Clint Eastwood, they don't care. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3642.96s)]
*  They don't know who the fuck he is. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3644.56s)]
*  OK. You mean they can't even say it. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3646.0s)]
*  Wow. They would go couldn't. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3648.4s)]
*  What? And I go Eastwood. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3651.6s)]
*  Right. They wouldn't know. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3655.68s)]
*  Wow. Like if you told them like who's Robert Mitchum, they would not know. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3656.88s)]
*  Who's Steve Robert Mitchum? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3661.36s)]
*  He was a deodorant guy. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3663.04s)]
*  Yeah, he was an actor for the 50s or any like any like like, for instance, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3665.2s)]
*  I've been to Korea. Right. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3668.72s)]
*  They know one knows who I am. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3670.48s)]
*  Really? Dude, it was like being invisible. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3673.12s)]
*  I got it reminding me of what it was like in high school. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3675.52s)]
*  Just like, oh, no one knows me. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3678.88s)]
*  Like when I walk around in L.A., I mean, I get recognized maybe it's not. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3680.4s)]
*  I don't live for it, but you were in 10, 15, 20 times. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3684.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, you people go love Tiger Belly, this and that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3687.52s)]
*  I don't feel as invisible. Right. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3690.8s)]
*  In Korea, they don't give a fuck about me except for the artists. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3692.72s)]
*  Like there's this guy named JYP who was like the puff daddy of Korea. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3699.7599999999998s)]
*  He flew me out there last time to do a music video for him. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3703.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, I mean, I was in a music video for a band called the Wonder Girls. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3706.9599999999996s)]
*  Dang. Yeah. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3710.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. So I flew out for that. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3711.12s)]
*  So they requested me, but all the civilians, they I had to wait in line. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3712.56s)]
*  No one said hi. It was like, yeah, no, they don't go fuck. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3717.68s)]
*  That's interesting. It feels like what it was like in high school. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3721.52s)]
*  That's such an interesting comparison. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3723.84s)]
*  Because the whole reason I don't want to get like, but the whole reason it's like, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3726.08s)]
*  I don't know about you, but growing up and even in my early 20s, I felt invisible. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3730.56s)]
*  You mean like I remember I lived with this guy named Kalisto. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3738.56s)]
*  He was a handsome Mexican dude. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3742.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. Sounds like it. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3743.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And we would walk into a bar and I one time a woman just walked up to him [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3745.2s)]
*  and started making out with him. He didn't even say hi. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3750.64s)]
*  My name is Kalisto. Nothing. Right. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3753.44s)]
*  And I walk in so invisible. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3755.3599999999997s)]
*  I just felt like, I don't know, like I didn't exist almost. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3758.64s)]
*  Right. And then you just kind of pursue this thing to like express yourself. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3762.24s)]
*  You know, yeah, this comedy thing, you know what I mean? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3766.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's like, I finally got to the point, you know, where, you know, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3768.72s)]
*  I don't feel as invisible. I feel like I'm a part of the world. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3771.6s)]
*  I guess, you know, it's so sad to even think that I even need to do all this to feel that way. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3774.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? It is. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3778.8s)]
*  It makes sense, though, man, especially what you're saying. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3781.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like I can really relate to that. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3783.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like, oh, man, I realized that like, like my mom never, like, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3785.6800000000003s)]
*  looked at me very much or she just worked all she was gone. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3791.76s)]
*  And my dad wasn't around. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3796.8s)]
*  So, yeah, I think I felt like nobody ever saw me like, man, nobody even knows [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3798.0800000000004s)]
*  nobody that I care about or anything even knows who I am. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3804.4s)]
*  You know, yeah, like I would give anything, I think, as a child, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3807.12s)]
*  I'd give anything for somebody to just look at me. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3811.12s)]
*  You know, like, man, if somebody would have just sat and looked at me. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3814.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, would I even have done this job? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3818.0s)]
*  Sometimes I think about that. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3820.96s)]
*  No, honestly, if I had like, like, I feel like normal parents that like listened and [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3822.56s)]
*  goes, how do you feel today? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3829.12s)]
*  Or I mean, I adore you. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3830.48s)]
*  I adore you or give me a hug or any of that. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3832.08s)]
*  Right. I don't know. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3834.64s)]
*  I'd probably be different. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3835.92s)]
*  I'd probably be like you and I would probably be working for, you know what I mean? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3837.76s)]
*  Amazon in the warehouse delivery guys, delivery guys or something. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3842.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3846.4s)]
*  But we'd have a woman, we'd have kids paying mortgage. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3846.7200000000003s)]
*  It sounds horrible. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3850.64s)]
*  I don't know if it sounds horrible. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3851.92s)]
*  It sounds hard, though. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3852.7200000000003s)]
*  It sounds really hard, especially given the way that you go. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3854.56s)]
*  Like, it sounds so hard for me to like get in. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3857.28s)]
*  It's like it's been so hard for me to trust, like, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3859.92s)]
*  the affections of anything in the world, like, really, you know? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3862.32s)]
*  It's like so I've always had that issue of like, I used to say sometimes that I would, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3866.16s)]
*  if I if I jumped off a cliff, if I heard a woman's high heels, like, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3872.7200000000003s)]
*  I would find a way to get back up just to see her like. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3876.88s)]
*  Wait, no, no, no, no, that doesn't make any sense. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3881.04s)]
*  So you're you're on the Golden Gate Bridge. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3882.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3885.52s)]
*  And you're about to jump off and you kill yourself. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3885.84s)]
*  And I do jump. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3887.84s)]
*  You do jump in midair. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3888.8s)]
*  You see, you hear high heels. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3890.16s)]
*  You do what Princess Leah did in that one movie and go back to the ship. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3892.08s)]
*  I would find a way to find I would find a way to get back up [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3896.96s)]
*  just to see if that woman would give me attention. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3900.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, like I would find it's like there's something inside of me that would give anything to have. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3903.2799999999997s)]
*  And it doesn't even have to be like sex. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3910.08s)]
*  It just has to be some sort of attention, like a look or just to see if they see me. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3911.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3936.24s)]
*  Do you really you don't feel like you had that as a kid, huh? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3937.12s)]
*  No, I mean, I tell this story sometimes where [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3941.04s)]
*  and this this really kind of sums up my childhood. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3944.08s)]
*  When I was eight years old, we lived in Minnesota. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3950.56s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3953.12s)]
*  Yeah, at Dynah, Minnesota. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3953.6s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3956.24s)]
*  Because you know what else happened up there. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3957.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I would have had them, bro. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3959.52s)]
*  I get it, dude. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3960.96s)]
*  And I lived in a Dynah, Minnesota. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3962.48s)]
*  Dover Drive was my street. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3964.4s)]
*  And I remember I didn't have a lot of friends. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3966.4s)]
*  So one day I went I was like eight years old and I go, mommy, daddy, could I have a pet? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3969.36s)]
*  And they go, oh, what kind? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3977.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I go, a cat. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3979.04s)]
*  So they got my cat, a kitten. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3981.6s)]
*  And I remember that summer, I get emotionally even thinking about it. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3984.48s)]
*  I named him Tom because it's like I didn't know anything else. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3989.44s)]
*  Tom and Jerry was a thing back then. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3992.08s)]
*  So it was good. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3993.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3994.4s)]
*  So I named him Tom. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3994.56s)]
*  And I remember being in the garage because he wouldn't be let in the house. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=3996.08s)]
*  We kind of had like a little pen in the garage and I would play with them all day long for weeks. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4000.16s)]
*  And then one day I left, I came home and Tom was gone. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4006.8s)]
*  I was freaking out. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4011.36s)]
*  Where's Tom? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4012.32s)]
*  And my dad looks at me goes, he no longer here. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4013.36s)]
*  I go, what happened? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4018.1600000000003s)]
*  I put it pound. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4019.6000000000004s)]
*  No. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4022.0s)]
*  And I go, why? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4022.96s)]
*  Mommy, allergic. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4024.1600000000003s)]
*  And then I started crying and they go, stop crying. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4026.8s)]
*  And then they left the garage. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4031.6000000000004s)]
*  And then they left the garage. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4033.04s)]
*  And I remember sitting there, tears. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4034.2400000000002s)]
*  There's no voice, like no compromise. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4037.1200000000003s)]
*  No, how do you feel? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4040.1600000000003s)]
*  No reason why. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4042.4s)]
*  No reason why. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4043.36s)]
*  There's no there's no voice. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4044.32s)]
*  And I just had to take it. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4047.6800000000003s)]
*  I was powerless. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4049.92s)]
*  And I just, that's like my upbringing in a nutshell. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4052.4s)]
*  I just felt like no one heard me. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4057.04s)]
*  And so that's why I learned to act out. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4059.2000000000003s)]
*  I learned to like, you know, be funny and do shit. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4061.92s)]
*  But it's like, that's why I have seven animals now. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4067.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4069.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4070.48s)]
*  Because it's like, I love animals so much. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4070.88s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4074.88s)]
*  I'm just compensating for that. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4076.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4078.48s)]
*  I don't know what happened to that kid, that cat. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4078.88s)]
*  But it's just like, it just sums up like why I am the way I am, I think. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4081.92s)]
*  You know? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4086.08s)]
*  I get so angry even thinking about it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4087.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4089.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4090.24s)]
*  And when he died two years ago. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4091.84s)]
*  Fuck, how long did he live for? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4095.92s)]
*  Until he was 80. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4097.68s)]
*  And I loved the man. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4098.8s)]
*  I do. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4099.84s)]
*  I loved my dad. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4100.24s)]
*  Oh, you mean you were thinking about the cat? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4102.08s)]
*  I thought Tom. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4103.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4106.8s)]
*  That's really funny, dude. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4109.84s)]
*  I'm sorry, man. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4111.12s)]
*  My dad. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4112.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4113.04s)]
*  When he died, I remember like, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4114.24s)]
*  just look at my brother and my mom. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4117.76s)]
*  They're just bawling. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4119.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4120.8s)]
*  They're just on the ground rolling around in tears. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4122.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4125.2s)]
*  And I literally was just looking at not a tear in my eye. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4126.24s)]
*  I was numb. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4130.32s)]
*  I was like, this is fucking weird. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4132.32s)]
*  What do I do? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4134.72s)]
*  So I put sunglasses on because I knew my uncles and aunts were coming in. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4135.84s)]
*  Right? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4139.12s)]
*  Because I wanted to pretend like I was emotional about it. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4139.84s)]
*  But it's like, I didn't feel anything. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4142.8s)]
*  And I love it and I miss him. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4144.24s)]
*  But it's like, I know I just have all these unresolved feelings toward him. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4145.6s)]
*  You know? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4149.84s)]
*  I would never do that to my own child. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4153.200000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4156.8s)]
*  He also beat us and all that stuff. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4158.64s)]
*  But it's like, I don't know, man. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4160.08s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4162.64s)]
*  I haven't really fully worked it out. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4163.04s)]
*  But I mean, there's reasons why I'm so fucked up, I think. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4164.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4166.96s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4168.88s)]
*  I'm sorry that that happened to you. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4169.280000000001s)]
*  It's all right, man. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4170.400000000001s)]
*  I really am. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4171.6s)]
*  No. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4172.160000000001s)]
*  That kind of shit's heartbreaking, man. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4173.360000000001s)]
*  Stuff like that happens to kids. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4175.36s)]
*  Do you think, because I have things like that too, man. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4178.96s)]
*  Sometimes there's so much anger built up inside. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4181.52s)]
*  Some days, a lot of times I'm OK. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4183.84s)]
*  And then sometimes I'm so angry. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4185.92s)]
*  You know what I got? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4188.64s)]
*  I finally realized the other day while I was angry, I realized, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4189.36s)]
*  because I've always had a lot of anger against my mother. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4193.12s)]
*  I didn't really know my dad that good. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4199.2s)]
*  So my mother's the only parent left. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4200.4800000000005s)]
*  I get angry sometimes because she missed out on me. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4205.36s)]
*  That's what I feel like. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4207.84s)]
*  She missed out on whoever I was or whatever was unique about me [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4209.84s)]
*  or not unique or whatever my feelings were. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4216.96s)]
*  She missed out on all of it. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4220.24s)]
*  She's still alive, right? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4224.24s)]
*  Yeah, she's still alive. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4225.12s)]
*  I think I've seen photos with her. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4225.76s)]
*  Do you help her if she needs help and stuff? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4227.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4229.92s)]

*  I help support and stuff like that. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4231.76s)]
*  I'm grateful that my mom, I think she did the best she could. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4233.92s)]
*  And I think it's like it makes me sad also that [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4236.0s)]
*  my mom probably got treated that she only knew what she knew. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4239.28s)]
*  It's a cyclical thing. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4242.16s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4243.2s)]
*  It's a cyclical thing. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4243.84s)]
*  Yeah, because my parents had it worse when they grew up. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4244.8s)]

*  I literally still wouldn't change it for the world. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4256.8s)]
*  Because without all those past experiences, right, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4259.2s)]
*  I wouldn't be who I am now. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4262.4s)]

*  I honestly look in the mirror and I go, you know what, dude, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4268.8s)]
*  I'm so proud of myself for some of the things that I persevered through. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4271.2s)]
*  You know, I mean, this business is hard. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4276.5599999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4279.84s)]
*  There's a lot of rejection and a lot of like, am I going to make it? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4280.48s)]
*  And this is years of, you know, now, you know, you have the internet and, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4283.679999999999s)]

*  people do TikTok videos and they do different ways to make money. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4289.12s)]
*  But when I was coming up, right, you had one way. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4292.08s)]
*  You do the clubs, you become an opener, feature, headliner, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4294.48s)]
*  you get TV spots, hopefully you get a sitcom, and that's pretty much it. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4298.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4301.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4302.32s)]
*  And it's like, I was just so proud that I was like, I came to LA with no money. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4303.04s)]
*  I didn't know anybody from show business. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4308.24s)]
*  And I crawled my way to where I am now. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4311.12s)]
*  And there's, you know, there's a resilience to that, I think. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4313.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4316.24s)]
*  I always downplay it. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4316.64s)]
*  And I have a little self-esteem, but it's like, but at the end of the day, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4318.32s)]
*  I'm a fucking warrior in a weird way. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4321.52s)]
*  Right? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4323.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4324.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4324.72s)]
*  It's like I did something because a lot of people that have had my kind of upbringing, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4325.04s)]
*  they turn to drugs, they don't get sober. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4330.0s)]
*  They perpetuate their behavior and they become shitty dads themselves or whatever it might be. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4332.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4337.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's like I chose to, you know, get sober frequently during my life and try to read books [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4338.24s)]
*  to help better myself, to be a good guy. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4345.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4348.4800000000005s)]
*  You haven't given up. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4348.96s)]
*  I'm not going to give up. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4350.320000000001s)]
*  You never give up on yourself. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4351.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4352.080000000001s)]
*  And the resilience of it, but it's like, it's a tough business. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4353.280000000001s)]
*  And so I wouldn't change anything for the world, would you? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4356.240000000001s)]
*  Let's be real because you're Theo Vaughn. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4361.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, well, I think it just goes back to that one thing that it's like, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4363.84s)]
*  if I didn't need attention, if I didn't need, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4369.68s)]
*  I remember a lot of my high school girlfriends and stuff, I kept, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4374.4s)]
*  I'm still keeping in touch with their mothers. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4377.36s)]
*  Like I'm still friends with their mothers. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4380.88s)]
*  It's like friends with them. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4382.88s)]
*  Even more than I talked to the girls, it's like there was just such a pattern. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4384.8s)]
*  You know, it's like, I just wonder if I would have been, yeah, I would have been different. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4388.48s)]
*  But so some of that I think that makes me sad, but no, I don't think so, man. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4393.76s)]
*  I think it's probably the same for you. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4398.96s)]
*  It's like, I chose like, if something in the world isn't going to see me, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4400.72s)]
*  then I'm going to take the hardest thing the world has supposedly, which is stand-up comedy, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4406.56s)]
*  and I'm going to fucking make you see me. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4411.12s)]
*  You know, I'm going to make you see me. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4415.12s)]
*  It's almost, sometimes I think I needed everybody in the world to love me [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4417.76s)]
*  just because I wanted to get my mother to love me. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4420.56s)]
*  It's like, I just figured eventually it will get back to her. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4422.4800000000005s)]
*  And then I'll feel some type of way, you know? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4427.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm not trying to get into self-pity either. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4430.56s)]
*  I got to be aware of that because I get into self-pity. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4431.92s)]
*  No, yeah, yeah, no, yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4433.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4679.52s)]
*  And then we think, oh, this is not going to work. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4680.64s)]
*  But we went into Zoom and we pitched it and they liked, really liked one of them. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4683.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4688.48s)]

*  It's been eight months. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4699.28s)]
*  It's been eight months. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4700.16s)]

*  And we'll support them. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4723.28s)]
*  I think I do feel a little unsupported that it's taken this long. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4724.72s)]
*  It's not. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4727.5199999999995s)]

*  Well, I mean, I. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4733.2s)]
*  The whole reason why we're doing it is because we want to go to Hawaii. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4734.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4738.16s)]

*  You know, I mean, hopefully, you know, we can do this, you know, I mean, and get back. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4850.16s)]
*  But, oh, you know, take a while. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4853.92s)]
*  I think. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4855.44s)]
*  Oh, I think you guys. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4856.0s)]
*  I mean, I've never heard him have any animosity. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4857.2s)]
*  I don't think he ever does. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4859.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4861.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4861.28s)]
*  And it never really does have any animosity towards anybody. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4861.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4864.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4864.72s)]
*  Which is crazy to think that he came from a fighting world where they had that so much animosity. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4866.0s)]
*  That's something that's always interesting about him. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4869.679999999999s)]
*  But he's one of the hardest workers that I know. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4871.28s)]
*  But that whole thing was just fucking absolutely retarded. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4874.08s)]
*  I'm like, is everybody retarded? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4876.72s)]
*  And now it's like it's like it was like the game of Clue, though. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4878.4s)]
*  It was like somebody did it in the fucking. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4881.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4883.36s)]
*  In a mop closet with a bad server. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4883.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4886.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4886.96s)]
*  I didn't even know. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4887.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4888.96s)]
*  It was also like I was at the time when they made the calls, I was on set shooting something [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4889.84s)]
*  in Oklahoma. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4894.8s)]
*  It was like it really just the timing was really weird. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4895.2s)]
*  And it's like whenever somebody is like, you know, accuse me of something I didn't do. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4897.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4901.76s)]
*  It feels like traumatic almost, like because it's like the way they were talking, you know [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4902.400000000001s)]
*  what I mean? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4907.6s)]
*  It's like, you know, they were like, no, I don't believe the wrong word, but they were [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4907.76s)]
*  just really adamant about it. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4912.4800000000005s)]
*  And they had a lot of feelings behind it. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4914.16s)]
*  Well, they believed it. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4916.08s)]
*  I don't think I think these kind of maybe still do. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4917.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4919.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I don't think they was making it up. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4919.92s)]
*  You think they still believe it? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4922.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4924.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4926.96s)]
*  I feel like they still believe it. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4927.5199999999995s)]
*  Bernie and I haven't really spoken about it much. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4928.72s)]
*  Yeah, I try not to talk about it either, but I don't know. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4930.5599999999995s)]
*  But I thought the whole thing was just whole. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4933.12s)]
*  I mean, it was but it was interesting, too. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4935.92s)]
*  It's all it's all like the world is just it's all this. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4938.16s)]
*  It's all this crazy just drama of this play, and we're just taking different paths through it. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4942.0s)]
*  It was fucking pretty cool. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4948.88s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4950.0s)]
*  I kind of I would not change that either because it's like, you know. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4950.88s)]
*  No, we've been really lucky. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4954.48s)]
*  So yeah, we're really lucky. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4955.679999999999s)]
*  And it's funny because sometimes I used to think, man, it's sometimes it's like I was like, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4957.679999999999s)]
*  man, if I laughed more as a human, then I would be out in the crowd enjoying the show. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4961.28s)]
*  Sometimes I want to be the guy in the crowd just having a good time. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4965.759999999999s)]
*  But I felt like I never even could be that guy. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4969.28s)]
*  So I had to be the other guy. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4972.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4975.36s)]
*  You're right. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4976.32s)]
*  Like when I'm in a show, are you having a good time? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4976.88s)]
*  Sometimes I am. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4980.88s)]
*  But I look at the people in the crowd and be like, oh, man, I wish I had like the patience and the [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4982.08s)]
*  just ability to sit and be just like enjoy something from someone like I sometimes I don't [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4988.72s)]
*  I struggle with that. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4995.2s)]
*  I think or I don't know. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4996.08s)]
*  Sometimes I'm envious of the people in the audience having a good time. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=4997.36s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely have to force myself into doing things because I'm trying to like [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5000.48s)]
*  because I really want to change that about myself. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5007.12s)]
*  You know, because generally I don't even show up to anything. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5009.599999999999s)]
*  I see you working on it, man. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5011.44s)]
*  You've been doing a lot of podcasts. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5012.4s)]
*  You're staying busy. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5013.679999999999s)]
*  You did the movie. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5014.4s)]
*  You're staying. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5015.12s)]
*  I'll let you know. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5015.599999999999s)]
*  Like I've been going to like like premieres. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5016.24s)]
*  It's like, you know, I mean, like I've like I've been invited to premieres. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5019.2s)]
*  I've not gone to a single fucking one, bro. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5022.24s)]
*  I just like I don't want to sit there. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5024.88s)]
*  I don't know what to say around the people. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5027.04s)]
*  You get nervous, but you get anxious. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5028.88s)]
*  I get so anxious. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5030.320000000001s)]
*  And then it's like, but what I've been doing to do this has been working for me, dude. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5031.04s)]
*  The last two years, what I've been doing is because usually like when I'm like on a set, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5034.4800000000005s)]
*  I go in my head, I go, they know, they know I'm not talented. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5041.12s)]
*  Or I go, I don't want to talk to the producers or the director because I don't want to burn [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5046.56s)]
*  any bridges. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5050.72s)]
*  You mean, or if I feel uncomfortable, I'm not going to say, but I've done the reverse now. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5051.84s)]
*  I've gone up to them. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5056.24s)]
*  I go, what do you think of this? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5057.28s)]
*  This is my ideas. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5058.72s)]
*  I become friends with them. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5060.0s)]
*  I treat them like anyone else, like a fucking comic or whatever. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5061.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5065.12s)]
*  It's gotten so much better for me. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5065.599999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5067.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5067.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5067.5199999999995s)]
*  Now I feel way more relaxed. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5067.84s)]
*  I feel a part of the process, dude, when I did fucking Harold and Kumar. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5070.0s)]
*  This is 20 years ago, dude. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5075.36s)]
*  I had never taken an acting class, bro. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5076.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5078.88s)]
*  And all of a sudden I'm being flown to Toronto and I'm on set and there's just I've never [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5079.5199999999995s)]
*  seen cameras like that before. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5085.12s)]
*  And I had some lines, you know what I mean? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5087.04s)]
*  Some chunky things I had to say. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5088.48s)]
*  And I remember I spent three days in my hotel room writing every single word down backwards [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5090.48s)]
*  and forwards so I wouldn't forget. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5096.96s)]
*  And then when I was on the set, I remember I didn't talk to anybody and I was petrified. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5099.36s)]
*  I couldn't breathe and they would go, action. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5103.36s)]
*  And I would just do it. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5105.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5106.72s)]
*  And then like I wouldn't ask, you know, is that right? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5107.599999999999s)]
*  Should I do it again? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5110.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5111.44s)]
*  I just was not even there. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5112.16s)]
*  I wasn't even present. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5113.599999999999s)]
*  That's like meter and sex, I feel like. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5114.48s)]
*  They say action and I just do it real fast and stop doing it. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5117.759999999999s)]
*  How long do you last? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5120.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5121.839999999999s)]
*  No, be real. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5122.32s)]
*  Oh, I would say probably four minutes. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5123.28s)]
*  Is that enough? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5138.4s)]
*  That's not enough. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5139.28s)]
*  Four minutes? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5141.12s)]
*  Maybe five, maybe five. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5142.879999999999s)]
*  What time of year is it? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5144.08s)]
*  Oh, it depends. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5145.6s)]
*  If it's colder out, I'll stay in there. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5146.64s)]
*  Yeah. What you do is this my move. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5148.8s)]
*  You go, I'm about to come up with the cup and you pull out. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5151.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5154.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5154.88s)]
*  And you know what they call that? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5155.12s)]
*  They call it edging. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5158.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5160.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5161.6s)]
*  When you're about to come and you don't do it, you're on the edge. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5162.56s)]
*  Oh, and then what do you do? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5165.36s)]
*  Then you scare your neighbors. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5166.56s)]
*  You pull out, right? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5169.76s)]
*  And you go to the bathroom, you wash your face, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5170.8s)]
*  you let it go down a little bit and you come back for the second round. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5173.12s)]
*  And what are they doing the whole time there? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5176.32s)]
*  Do you put the TV on or something? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5177.599999999999s)]

*  And then you go to round two. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5194.5599999999995s)]
*  My point is that you have the opportunity to stop. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5196.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5201.599999999999s)]
*  Or is it when you're in there, you just have to keep going? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5201.84s)]
*  I feel like I'm like those Thai miners or whatever. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5204.64s)]
*  They couldn't get out. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5206.8s)]
*  It'll be the soccer team. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5209.04s)]
*  The Chilean miners. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5211.4400000000005s)]

*  You think? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5220.16s)]
*  Dude, if I was a Thai soccer team and I was in a mountain, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5221.68s)]
*  like in the fucking caverns with water and stuff. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5227.4400000000005s)]
*  Imagine you're claustrophobic. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5230.96s)]

*  I would probably take a shit. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5234.4800000000005s)]
*  You be the leader. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5235.12s)]

*  Rambo too. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5268.96s)]
*  And remember he hid in the cliff, right? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5269.68s)]
*  The soldier walked by and his eyes popped out. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5272.4800000000005s)]

*  Well, we got to go. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5278.64s)]
*  We got to get out of the cliff. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5279.280000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5280.4800000000005s)]

*  What are we going to do? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5387.76s)]
*  Oh, Ramrock. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5389.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5390.4800000000005s)]
*  I was sleeping. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5392.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. Go back. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5394.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5396.4s)]
*  And then what I would do is I would test the water. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5397.12s)]
*  Every hour I would go, I dunk my head in to the water. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5400.96s)]
*  Because what happened was they swam, right? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5404.16s)]
*  And then a swell came in and filled all that up and they couldn't get back. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5406.96s)]
*  Right? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5411.2s)]
*  So I would test. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5411.68s)]
*  Don't tell me what happens. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5412.4s)]
*  I don't know what happens. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5413.04s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5414.4s)]
*  Don't tell me what happens with them. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5415.04s)]
*  I know there's a duck. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5416.0s)]
*  I want to read it or whatever when we get out of here. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5417.5199999999995s)]
*  But keep going. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5420.16s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck happened to them. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5421.84s)]
*  Okay. Good. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5423.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5424.08s)]
*  I don't know the conclusion. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5424.88s)]
*  I know they lived. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5425.76s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5426.72s)]
*  You don't think they lived? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5429.92s)]
*  You're just like my ex-girlfriend. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5431.599999999999s)]
*  She just can't not tell you what happened. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5432.88s)]
*  Yeah. They lived, bro. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5435.36s)]
*  Dude, obviously they lived. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5437.12s)]
*  Who took the fucking photo? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5439.12s)]
*  Some pervert. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5441.04s)]
*  It wasn't a pedophile. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5441.36s)]
*  It was the people that rescued them. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5442.88s)]
*  Oh, you think pedophiles are only above ground, dude? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5445.12s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5448.32s)]
*  Oh, those are ground pedophiles? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5449.28s)]
*  I think so, bro. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5450.56s)]
*  They do ground work? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5451.92s)]
*  I'm sure they do, man. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5452.88s)]
*  Here's some pedophile doing group work. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5454.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5456.32s)]
*  No, that was the rescue team. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5457.52s)]
*  They took the photo and then they're like, what's up? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5458.56s)]
*  What's up? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5461.6s)]
*  Those guys, why is he so mad? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5463.12s)]
*  This is asthma, I think. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5465.12s)]
*  But he seems like he's in a bad mood or something. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5466.64s)]
*  I just said, when I came in here, he didn't smile at me or nothing. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5468.64s)]
*  Maybe something. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5472.32s)]
*  Well, I'm not a big enough guess. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5473.76s)]
*  Is that what it is, bro? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5474.88s)]
*  I was just checking the camera. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5475.68s)]
*  I know, but when I came in here in the first place, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5476.72s)]
*  you weren't smiling or nothing. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5478.400000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to focus on the thing. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5480.400000000001s)]
*  I got cameras, got to focus, make sure the audio is good. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5482.08s)]
*  I'm excited, personally. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5485.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm just focused. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5487.92s)]
*  Nice. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5488.8s)]
*  How long have you been working with them? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5489.92s)]
*  Zach's been working here probably for two months. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5492.88s)]
*  One year, but yeah, close. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5495.12s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5497.04s)]
*  Oh, damn, my bad. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5497.6s)]
*  He got that. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5499.92s)]
*  But as full time? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5501.36s)]
*  Yeah, two, three months. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5503.52s)]
*  OK, there we go. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5504.56s)]
*  So he wasn't wrong. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5505.36s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5505.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5506.64s)]
*  Did he go to Nashville with you? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5507.52s)]
*  Grateful to have him. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5508.8s)]
*  No, he does not. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5510.0s)]
*  Him and Colin work here. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5511.6s)]
*  You know what I want to do is I want to go to Nashville. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5514.08s)]
*  You're not coming back out here, right? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5517.28s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5518.88s)]
*  You're going to move back out here? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5519.68s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5520.8s)]
*  I'm going to go test out Austin for one month in January [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5521.36s)]
*  when Joe's Club opens up. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5523.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5524.88s)]
*  Should I test it out, too? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5526.4s)]
*  That would be fun. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5527.679999999999s)]
*  There's three stages there, four. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5528.719999999999s)]
*  Once his opens up, there's four. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5530.719999999999s)]
*  Do you want me to get an Airbnb for a month? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5531.759999999999s)]
*  Dude, what if you lived there for one month? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5534.08s)]
*  But can we live together? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5535.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5536.96s)]
*  Tim Dillon has a house. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5538.48s)]
*  I'm being real. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5540.799999999999s)]
*  Do you want an R&B, how do you say it? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5541.44s)]
*  R&B? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5543.599999999999s)]
*  R&B, R&B. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5544.08s)]
*  I think if it's from a black guy, it's Airbnb. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5545.44s)]
*  Like Airbnb. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5550.16s)]
*  It's R&B. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5551.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5551.84s)]
*  So if we got to, so we went to Austin for a month, Airbnb, right? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5552.48s)]
*  We would do spots around town. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5556.88s)]
*  Do shows. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5558.24s)]
*  Do shows. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5558.88s)]

*  I think that would be fun. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5561.44s)]
*  Be cool. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5562.32s)]
*  I want to do it. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5563.5199999999995s)]

*  Okay. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5568.16s)]
*  But get an Airbnb with two rooms or whatever. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5569.04s)]
*  Yeah, or more than two rooms. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5572.0s)]
*  And one month, I'll just get it for a month. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5573.84s)]
*  We'll get hit up Tim Dillon. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5576.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5586.24s)]
*  Let's look at a couple news stories before Bobby gets out of here, man. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5587.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, big one is we had the kids mullet championships happen this weekend. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5591.12s)]
*  We had a lot of people posting about this with you Theo. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5596.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5598.799999999999s)]
*  I kind of want to look through some of these guys if you want. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5599.36s)]
*  Since Bobby stole my style a while back. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5601.5199999999995s)]

*  Huh? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=5616.16s)]

*  What? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6241.139999999999s)]

*  Let's go to the fucking homeless island, bro, and get malaria or whatever. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6261.08s)]
*  They get probably diseases there. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6265.64s)]
*  Oh, yellow fever, everything they have it. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6267.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6268.84s)]
*  But then there's going to be probably a gift shop or something on the island. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6269.4s)]
*  You're going to be able to get a picture taken with a homeless guy. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6272.2s)]

*  Dude, if we got to run a gift shop on a homeless island, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6295.96s)]
*  but you're going to have those crap. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6299.4s)]

*  I think you'd have to put up barricades and hide drugs in the middle of the island. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6311.16s)]
*  But would you helicopter? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6315.32s)]

*  It sounds expensive. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6329.24s)]
*  And especially they're going to stay alive for so long out there in the summer, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6330.28s)]
*  which they should. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6333.48s)]

*  It's much like yes, it's basically in the future. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6361.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6363.8s)]

*  OK. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6366.6s)]
*  And basically in the future, New York City is now one large prison. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6367.24s)]
*  So they just built a wall around New York City and all everyone that's a convict and gang member, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6372.52s)]
*  they just live there. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6378.92s)]

*  Right. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6384.92s)]
*  But I think it's going to be a lot like that where you you build a gigantic wall around the island. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6385.4s)]
*  You have to ship your meat, fucking food or whatever. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6390.599999999999s)]

*  they just let them run wild. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6409.5599999999995s)]
*  They're going to open 50 to 100 tiny homes. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6411.88s)]
*  And then they're going to have services there, they say, but they don't go into a lot of specifics. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6414.84s)]
*  But there are going to be like 50 to 100 tiny homes. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6418.12s)]
*  They were experimenting with this in Venice, too, if you're familiar. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGOKJvNAd38&t=6420.04s)]
