# Check Ball  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #338
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [May 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM)
*  You know this doesn't have to be perfect you know. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking about right now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3.0s)]
*  This doesn't have to be perfect. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=6.0s)]
*  Isn't that a nice thing to say? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=8.0s)]
*  This doesn't have to be perfect. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=12.0s)]
*  I gotta remember that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=14.0s)]
*  What it is, what it ain't. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=17.0s)]
*  Does the baby need a spank? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=20.0s)]
*  That used to be a little limerick. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=23.0s)]
*  A limerick is basically a little Irish poem or something. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=27.0s)]
*  It's basically the Irish you can't really, a lot of times you can't even understand them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=34.0s)]
*  So people were so happy when they finally heard something out of the Irish that they could understand they gave it a dang name. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=39.0s)]
*  Limerick. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=47.0s)]
*  And uh. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=50.0s)]
*  Anyway that's a Irish limerick. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=53.0s)]
*  What it is, what it ain't. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=55.0s)]
*  Does the baby need a spank? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=57.0s)]
*  Have me a couple of Advil right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=59.0s)]
*  Ah with that liquid death I don't know if you've ever had Advil or not. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=64.0s)]
*  But I have them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=68.0s)]
*  You know I Advil to everything I do man. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=70.0s)]
*  Hell I wish I made a damn suppository. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=72.0s)]
*  You know when I was young there was a thing called Vagipin. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=75.0s)]
*  And I hate to get crude and be a naughty boy out here early. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=80.0s)]
*  But when I was young they had a thing called Vagipin. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=85.0s)]
*  And that was traveling through the south right around the time that um. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=89.0s)]
*  You know uh. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=93.0s)]
*  What was it called? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=96.0s)]
*  Jinkum. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=97.0s)]

*  It's like you're in a wheelchair but also. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1267.0s)]
*  You're like on a rock rock what's it called Rosseller roller coaster. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1272.0s)]

*  Had to start growing up. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1311.0s)]
*  If that makes any sense I felt like it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1314.0s)]
*  Kind of made me realize some things that I had to grow up a little. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1318.0s)]
*  Shit you know I got to at least hit 10 emotionally or 11. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1322.0s)]
*  So. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1326.0s)]
*  So anyway I think it's really interesting though like I'm monitoring how I feel if my mood feels better. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1328.0s)]
*  I'm hoping to be able to quit antidepressants with the help of a doctor. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1334.0s)]
*  And so that's some of the things that I'm hopeful hopeful for in it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1340.0s)]
*  But I wanted to update you guys on it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1347.0s)]
*  For me it's a lot about just feeling OK like am I OK am I OK. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1353.0s)]
*  So that's the kind of a lot of thing that I talk about when I'm in there. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1357.0s)]
*  Under the influence. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1361.0s)]
*  Because there's some of which I'm like is this really helpful or am I just doing drugs in a strip mall somewhere. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1363.0s)]
*  You know I'm saying like am I just doing drugs by this damn five guys you know I'm saying what's really going on here. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1370.0s)]
*  And that's the crazy part the place I go you're wall to wall with a damn five guys do. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1378.0s)]
*  And for those guys smell like fucking burgers brought to you that I don't know who the fifth dude is but. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1384.0s)]

*  If you almost put your ear up I swear to God I could hear somebody. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1401.0s)]
*  Finishing off a double in there. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1405.0s)]
*  And God that really will. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1408.0s)]
*  That'll make you want to get well right there when there's a burger in the next room. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1411.0s)]

*  To like have stuff I don't know I think I just relate so much with not having anything and with being. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=1443.0s)]

*  You know I saved some things at home for us to do together like just to go shopping for small things and not even save them. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3447.0s)]
*  I think I just hadn't done them. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3455.0s)]
*  So you know it was nice to spend time together. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3457.0s)]
*  I thought about having her as a guest on the podcast but we don't really have it set up right now to do two people. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3461.0s)]
*  So we're going to have to wait maybe another time. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3468.0s)]
*  You know there were sometimes it was a little stressful and we kind of just went to our mutual corners and and that was OK. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3474.0s)]
*  You know you know it was kind of nice in a lot of ways man. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3482.0s)]
*  It was nice just like I think I kind of come to some realizations that like you know my relationship with my mother doesn't it doesn't have to be some perfect thing. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3487.0s)]
*  You know I think always in my head that it needs to land in some perfect place where it all has to be figured out. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3500.0s)]
*  And it's OK. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3508.0s)]
*  It can kind of be that's that skill saw it can kind of be you know it can just be kind of fluid. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3511.0s)]
*  And and so there was nice there was some niceness about that. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3522.0s)]
*  You know there was some niceness just to have some times also where I was like you know I just need some space to myself. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3528.0s)]
*  And I'm an adult now so I could do that I could take that space. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3535.0s)]
*  Well when I was a child I didn't really have that ability if I needed you know if you know you're you're kind of in your parents. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3539.0s)]
*  You know you're in their domain. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3550.0s)]
*  So so it was good man we went and picked out some different stuff and got some different thing got some soap got a shower caddy in my shower. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3554.0s)]
*  Because everything was just sitting on the bottom. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3563.0s)]
*  You know when you're kind of like you know just to stepping around the toothpaste and all of that and just trying to kick stuff away from the drain. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3566.0s)]
*  If you ever done that in your shower you just like don't set anything up so it's just in the bottom you just keep kicking it away from the drain. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3573.0s)]
*  But got a shower caddy forgot silverware. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3579.0s)]
*  So still doing you know still washing the plastics off in the sink. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3584.0s)]
*  But but it was nice we didn't have really like any heart to heart convos or anything like that. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3588.0s)]
*  You know and that's okay. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3595.0s)]
*  I'm glad that we both made the time to spend time together though. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3599.0s)]
*  You know we both made a commitment to to spend time together and. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3604.0s)]
*  And it was nice man we went out one night mom had a margarita her second one she's ever had. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3612.0s)]
*  So that was cool. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3618.0s)]
*  Had to put I had to ask her some you know ask her some questions about that about her first marriage after that. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3620.0s)]
*  And so you know I got into that a little but. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3626.0s)]
*  Yeah we had a nice time man I know that she loves me and. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3630.0s)]
*  You know and I'm hard to love sometimes you know I'm particular as an adult. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3635.0s)]
*  And I think they were those were safety mechanisms that I used as a kid. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3641.0s)]
*  And now they sometimes keep me too safe in some ways. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3646.0s)]
*  You know they can sometimes keep me so safe that. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3650.0s)]
*  I'm separate. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3654.0s)]
*  But that's okay I'm not complaining people sometimes are like man you're you're whining I'm not having self pity I'm just. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3658.0s)]
*  Sometimes I like to share what I'm thinking or feeling and it's not complaining it's not I'm just sharing it. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3665.0s)]
*  You know I just I just I'm just sharing it and so that's okay. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3672.0s)]
*  You know it's Mother's Day coming up and we're going to get to that in just a second and. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=3677.0s)]

*  So you could just say really obviously that's what this is. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCYveIKaROM&t=4025.0s)]
