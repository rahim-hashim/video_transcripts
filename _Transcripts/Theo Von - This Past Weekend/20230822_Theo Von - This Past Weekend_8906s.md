*  He sits right there on the doorstep of the devil and when the buzzer rings he answers it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=55.08s)]
*  He's based out of Lafayette, Louisiana [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=61.879999999999995s)]

*  They got it all going down there all type of death happening and he's gonna tell us more about it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=66.6s)]
*  I'm grateful for his time today. He's 18 years in the profession [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=71.16s)]
*  Today's guest is mr. Toby [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=76.36s)]
*  Sabwah [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=79.12s)]
*  I [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=85.08s)]
*  Am sitting here with a corner today, mr. Toby Sabwah and you are a corner. I am actually [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=107.6s)]
*  Death investigator for the coroner's office. The coroner is somewhat of a political position [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=114.48s)]
*  Involves being a doctor. So we have a doctor [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=120.56s)]
*  That's a coroner over or parish and then the majority of the works done by death investigators like myself [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=123.2s)]
*  Okay in Louisiana, they know you as the coroner just you know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=129.6s)]
*  It's too hard to break down medical death investigator versus coroner or coroner's office [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=133.8s)]
*  Oh, it's too hard to break down a good oyster dressing recipe over there for somebody. That's right [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=139.1s)]
*  You know I'm saying you put too much information on somebody in Louisiana. They're gonna start punching. That's right [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=143.28s)]
*  Especially at a time of death. Yeah, they're not they're not registering all that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=147.4s)]
*  So we go with coroner's office, but we are legally death investigators [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so when does someone call a corner and and what is a corner death investigator? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=154.8s)]
*  I'm gonna call it a corner for the episode. That's fine. Okay. What is a corner? So a coroner is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=160.58s)]
*  an elected position [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=167.12s)]
*  but [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  What we do is we go out when someone dies or we're called every time someone dies that lives within our parish [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=170.44s)]
*  Okay, or County or County in Louisiana its parishes [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=177.4s)]
*  So we will we're called if it's a natural case or if it's a homicide suicide any of the manners of death [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=182.72s)]
*  There's different rules for people that may not be from Louisiana or from our city and state [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=190.88s)]
*  If it's a natural cause it would go back to that state of residence [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  But anytime it's an accident or just your general natural death it comes to us [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, we have to pick up the phone and decide, you know, is this natural causes or is there foul play? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  We work closely with police. Okay, so the police give you a call. That's right [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  We get a call from the sheriff's office the local [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=215.08s)]
*  city police [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  hospitals nursing homes and they say Toby we got a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we have a case we have a we have a so in health care we say patients okay in the coroner's office [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  It's subject. So we have a subject here who's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=229.68s)]
*  An 86 year old laying in bed. Okay, and so then I know what questions to ask and how to pick the case apart [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=232.52s)]
*  And do you guys physically go to the scene? We do. Okay, not all scenes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean if it's an 80 year old who's on hypertension medicine and blood pressure medicine heart medication [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=243.56s)]
*  That's a gimme yeah that you know has a really really [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  history of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  Medical history we don't necessarily have to go out for those the police are there to call foul play, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=256.2s)]
*  But if they're laying in bed and they were found by their spouse [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=260.96s)]
*  You know, it's normally a natural case if they see something that may look suspicious then we'll go out [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=263.48s)]
*  All right, but for the majority of the naturals we don't we we can release those by phone and direct them to a funeral home [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=269.16s)]
*  Not even a zoom you don't have to do zoom or nothing. Nothing. No, we just we just take the call [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=274.92s)]
*  Get the information we still investigate the death, but we don't have to go out for everyone. Okay [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  So when you do go out, do you take like a toolkit with you or what do you guys is there like? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=286.04s)]
*  What do you bring with you? How do you approach a scene? Like if it's a sure a death? Yeah [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=291.68s)]
*  So subject so we have a bag of gear that we use now in Louisiana [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  We're a poor state and a poor parish when I started they gave me a can of off and a badge [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=300.24s)]
*  Really said tell us when they did no teasing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=305.6s)]
*  But but but [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=308.04s)]
*  Basically basically we go out so we have sir we have tools that we use on scene, you know [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=310.68s)]
*  We need we need a flashlight to see around sometimes [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=316.16s)]
*  The biggest thing that we do on scene after investigating the scene which goes into a lot of things [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=319.44s)]
*  Will do toxicology will draw blood [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  if the person suspect suspected overdose or overdose might be a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=327.76s)]
*  Possibility and most of the overdoses by the way are accidental overdoses [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  People hear OD and they think intentional but so if we think drugs were involved we'll bring a spinal needle [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=336.56s)]
*  Or just a regular syringe we can we can draw blood out of the heart [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=343.92s)]
*  Which is like a pulp fiction scene the movie with the long spinal needle. I'll go right in we go right in the heart [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=347.92s)]
*  There's no pulse so getting blood out of veins when they're deceased is is not a thing that we can do [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=353.2s)]
*  So we take blood from the heart or we can go in through the side of the eye [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=358.8s)]
*  And that's called vitriol fluid and how much is in the eye so we get about you know, four cc's out of the eye [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not always [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=369.92s)]
*  Some have more than really but we'll go in we'll tap in through the side of the eye [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=372.2s)]
*  You're not into the eyeball. Yeah, I'm into the eyeball [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  So I take a two or three inch long needle and I go in at a horizontal angle [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  Just to puncture it and then I aspirate the fluid out of there. That's in the eye. That's in the eye [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=385.08s)]
*  Yeah, so that's toxicology and when you're getting it out the eyeball [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=390.0s)]
*  There's less of a chance that it could clot up because we send these [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=395.16s)]
*  specimens to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=399.64s)]
*  Forensic toxicology lab [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=401.48s)]
*  So when you're going through the heart and the lung sometimes it can have blood clots in it and other things and they may not [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=403.2s)]
*  Be able to perform the test [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=408.24s)]
*  Ninety nine point nine percent of them with blood are fine [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=410.24s)]
*  But it is nice having that and then the heart's not always easy to find whether you know, it could be a core accident [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=413.44s)]
*  They could have some major crushing going on in the chest [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=420.0s)]
*  It could be a gunshot wound where there's no blood left in the heart that we can get [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=422.28s)]
*  Oh, so the eye is a second option [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=426.36s)]
*  and then if that doesn't work we can actually put a slit in the belly and pull out a piece of liver and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=428.76s)]
*  Send part of their liver off to a lab to be analyzed. So we have a syringe with several different size needles [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=434.48s)]
*  And tools to use if we have to cut into them to grab liver to send off and so that's all for taking toxicology [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=441.6s)]
*  That's right [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay, and what death determined toxicology like which so you said if it seems like a natural death you guys can almost do it over [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=448.76000000000005s)]
*  The phone, right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=455.0s)]
*  It's not if it's a different type of death where there could have been a homicide or an accident [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=456.16s)]
*  Then you want to show up and do toxicology, correct? We and we do more than toxicology [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  We're investigating the scene everything around it the home. Oh, I mean we have to we look at everything [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=465.36s)]
*  not only the body but the surroundings a lot of times that'll paint a picture of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=471.36s)]
*  What's going on with that individual case [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=476.0s)]
*  For instance, I had a case where you know, the deputy was new [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=479.12s)]
*  He thought it was suspicious because the 80 year old wife woke up and noticed her spouse was cold [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=484.64s)]
*  And the timeline on on that on that case the the deputy said he's really cold and she's just finding him [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=490.36s)]
*  Well, that's natural, you know, you're sleeping you may not notice your significant other is cold to the touch until yes [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=498.2s)]
*  If you don't have any type of intimate relationship, right? Well, you're 80 years old you've been sleeping together for 50 years, you know [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=503.48s)]
*  But he thought it was suspicious [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=511.36s)]
*  So in that regard I went out and said no she just rolled over and noticed that he was cold [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=513.84s)]
*  There's no foul play here. This 80 year old lady didn't whack her husband [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  You know after marriage for 50 years and if she did without showing signs of any trauma then good for her [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=522.44s)]
*  Yeah, you know, they've been married for way too long. But no, yeah, so some natural [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, at some point somebody you got to give her the benefit of the doubt. Yeah. Yeah, we'll go out when they question something [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=532.6s)]
*  Like so say on a scene are the police or sheriff's are they happy to see you or are they do you sometimes or do they? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=538.72s)]
*  Think oh this guy tries to contradict what we think usually no, no [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=543.94s)]
*  They're they're they really like when we come out a lot of times detectives will wait to hear if we're responding if we're responding [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=547.48s)]
*  Then there could be something abnormal then detectives will also come. Okay different different agencies [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=555.48s)]
*  Use their [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=561.94s)]
*  Detectives in different ways some respond to all others don't it just depends on the time and place [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=563.5s)]
*  Okay, but there are many difficult scenes to respond on but they're looking they're looking to us to help them [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=568.64s)]
*  You know rule out foul play and other things like that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=576.82s)]
*  So you guys have separate training than they do correct where we're medicine based their law enforcement based [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=580.3000000000001s)]
*  Although you know those guys really [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  Do a good job as you know, especially the ones that have been there a while sometimes they'll call things that I may have not noticed [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=589.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know and they'll say hey, what about this and they'll also give us a description of what went on [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=594.74s)]
*  They can look at the history of that of that subject to see you know [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=599.8s)]
*  This person's been arrested a several times for drug abuse or domestic violence, etc [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=603.4599999999999s)]
*  So they're giving us information that we can use. Yeah on that scene on and on that investigation [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=607.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so take me through like an interesting call that's coming in, you know, especially down there in Louisiana dang [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=614.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I knew people that could you know, they couldn't learn an alphabet and they took their own life [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=619.0200000000001s)]
*  That's right. We see a lot of that, you know [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=624.32s)]
*  There's a lot of preventable deaths that we can talk about but you know a typical call in Louisiana is [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=626.3800000000001s)]
*  Anything from heart disease suicide OD [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=633.46s)]
*  But to be more specific [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=637.0200000000001s)]
*  We've had many that they find a body floating in the bayou [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=640.0600000000001s)]
*  That can be different, you know because they've been exposed to water [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=644.0600000000001s)]
*  So, you know, they may be bloated more some of the the surface evidence or the trace evidence that we use is not there [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=647.82s)]
*  Because they've been floating you can see where turtles and and other animals in the water have nipped at them [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=654.4200000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so it can be somewhat gruesome and then hard to tell, you know, why are they in this water? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=660.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, they're dressed in regular street clothes. They weren't you know, they weren't swimming. They weren't swimming. They weren't fishing and they're in the water [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=665.94s)]
*  Sometimes people OD and their friends have no clue what to do with them. So they throw them into the bayou. Yeah [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  Sometimes these guys are just you know hanging out and they slip and fall and hit their head or they pass out [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=679.52s)]
*  You know, we don't always know what got them to the bayou [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=685.0s)]
*  Now how do those bodies look if you roll up on a box because I've always wanted to find a deceased body [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of that's a bucket list of mine. I see them every day, but I've never rolled up on one. Yeah. Yeah [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=692.84s)]
*  That is why is that a bucket list thing for people I don't know but it happens often [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=699.32s)]
*  I had a guy cutting the grass at a rent house and found a body [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  Did he get any intel or he just got lucky? No, he just got lucky [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  He was cutting grass and boom [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=712.2800000000001s)]
*  He found that body a lot of times if you work and stay focused and you keep working towards I mean, you know [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  It's better than some lazy dude who's doing nothing finding a body release that guys out there doing something [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=719.08s)]
*  Well when that lazy person finds a body you got a question [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=723.4000000000001s)]
*  We had [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=728.5200000000001s)]
*  We had one recently that was just a driver was passing by and there was a lady in the ditch [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=729.8000000000001s)]
*  Now what was interesting was her arms were removed. She was a Mexican female [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=735.08s)]
*  Damn so interesting. So they removed her arms because of her tattoos. So this was a oh the killer. This was a hit job [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  Correct, and they didn't want her identified, you know, so they see this in a ditch and they call us [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=748.5200000000001s)]
*  Then we got to figure out well, where's the arms, you know, so [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=753.6400000000001s)]
*  There's interesting cases like that where people just you know [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=757.38s)]
*  They write time write place and they find bodies and say you says did you roll up on that scene with no arms? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=760.38s)]
*  Yes. Yes. So when you get there, what's going on like are people milling around is somebody [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=765.86s)]
*  You know like what's the scene like when you roll up on it well in that regard there's no families present, you know [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=772.9s)]
*  It's different than most you know, it's a lot of sheriffs [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=779.2199999999999s)]
*  Standing around looking at the dead body now we have jurisdiction on that body and legally [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=783.26s)]
*  They're not supposed to touch that body until we get there. Okay, so of course I would get there look at the scene [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=787.9399999999999s)]
*  You know to try to find out does she have family around here? What's she doing in this area? She's not from here [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=794.54s)]
*  They'll do an investigation the law enforcement will do an investigation on their part and then I'll start looking at the body for obvious signs [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=801.9399999999999s)]
*  Of foul play and in this regard she had no arms [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=808.88s)]
*  So we knew something wasn't right and it wasn't like an alligator or an animal came out and removed her arms [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=811.5600000000001s)]
*  This was intentional. Wow, you know, so in that case we would get them to an autopsy [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=817.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and do you look for the arms or you just think just kind of put a note like [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=822.48s)]
*  Keeping out like keep an eye out for arms or whatever. Like what do y'all do about the arms? You don't worry about it [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=829.04s)]
*  Well the sheriff's office and law enforcement they worry about that they worry about that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=834.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah, I mean, of course we all look around the scene to see if you find anything because there could be evidence on those arms [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=839.5999999999999s)]
*  But many times they go, you know unfound oh [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=847.0s)]
*  Gosh, it'd be crazy. Yeah, I mean I had a guy find a foot once it was from a from a [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=851.56s)]
*  Fatality, but they called me and this was you know weeks later. Hey, we found a foot. Would you come pick it up? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=857.3s)]
*  They don't want to touch it even, you know, so I throw a bag in my car and I go grab a foot [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=862.72s)]
*  It's it's it's a different lifestyle. You know, yeah, yeah, you know if I get pulled over. Yeah, you know carrying anything [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=867.4s)]
*  Yeah, man, I got a foot in my car. Yeah, I got a ten and a half in the trunk. Absolutely [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=873.76s)]
*  Absolutely, dude, that's wild man. Yeah, that's interesting it and you put that foot in the trunk you put it in the back seat [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  What do you do? Yeah, well in that case, I figured it would be pretty pretty gnarly [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=885.84s)]
*  So I've actually brought a disposable ice chest and packed it in there and then got it to the funeral home that they brought her body to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  She may have been sent to cremation, but either way the funeral home would take care of that body part [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay, and I've traveled was with worse and you know in Louisiana doesn't snow often [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=903.12s)]
*  They had a we had a case years ago where it was an infant death and the autopsy places in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=909.0799999999999s)]
*  The autopsy place is about an hour and a half away from our where we live [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=915.56s)]
*  Okay, or where we work in our parish so they had a baby that had passed away and they asked hey [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  It was snowing really bad. Hey, can you meet us halfway with this child and I'm in my personal car [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm like sure so the baby of course is in a body bag [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=930.06s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm driving down the highway with a with a baby and how big that body but it's like a gallon or something [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm big. Well, it's you know, it's like a duffel bag for a baby. Oh, yeah [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=939.64s)]
*  But you know you again you get pulled over and I have an unmarked car [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=943.84s)]
*  I'm in street clothes or normally scrubs. Oh, you know, what are you carrying? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=948.0s)]
*  At least you're not in a me otter or something. Yeah, yeah [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=951.44s)]
*  No words, right you get pulled over in a me otter and you got a baby in a duffel bag, bro [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=953.92s)]
*  I kind of I kind of went over the speed limit just to kind of maybe man if I could only get pulled over here [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=957.96s)]
*  You know, it would be an interesting case. Oh, that'd be passing [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=963.2s)]
*  But no, you know, it's sad for when we lose babies like that [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=966.48s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is the baby needed to go to autopsy and we'll do anything we can [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=969.92s)]
*  To assist in that regard and if it meant driving through the snow 30 45 minutes, you know, we'll do that [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=975.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's some of the things that we do to help. So your responsibility then you feel a responsibility to [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=982.74s)]
*  Determine how people died. Is that it? Correct. We figure out why they died [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=990.52s)]
*  We put all the pieces of a puzzle together. Okay, some are cut and dry, you know [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=994.3s)]
*  We can look at their medication their age, you know, do they smoke drink how much do they weigh or they unhealthy? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1000.88s)]
*  You can tell that by their homes too. I mean, so I'm a Cajun investigator, right? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1008.04s)]
*  The first thing I look at is their fridge. I don't even look at the body [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1013.08s)]
*  I walk in the house and I open the fridge and you know when there's pizza bones and a spoon and a you know [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1016.2s)]
*  you know jar of beans and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1022.6s)]
*  Maybe some rotten Popeyes and a couple of 40 ounce beers. I know this person wasn't living a healthy lifestyle [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1024.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I know this person was listening a mystical to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1031.56s)]
*  So I'm thinking heart disease from the get-go [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1035.36s)]
*  So, you know again we look at their home the cleanliness the order of their home [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1039.6s)]
*  You can tell how people live [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1044.28s)]
*  So a lot of times the body is a reflection of its environment that it lives in. Absolutely [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1045.8s)]
*  So I was called to one case where the deputies said this one's [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1052.2s)]
*  This case is unusual [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1058.8400000000001s)]
*  We'd like you to come out and so then I go out and they had noticed some blood dripping on the floor on the floor [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1060.24s)]
*  Blood stains out of the body just in no just on the floor. Okay, that's all they'd noticed [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1065.72s)]
*  Right, they saw that and then the body was an adult male on a couch. Okay [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1070.3600000000001s)]
*  So I walk into the house and I mean we're we're reading everything the minute we get on scene even even you know [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  What friends and family are there? How do they look who's their neighbors? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1080.8s)]
*  What area they live in so I walk into the house and this was kind of in the country and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1084.2s)]
*  The first thing I see is he had Mickey's malt liquor memorabilia everywhere. Mm-hmm. So I said, okay, okay [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1089.36s)]
*  I like this guy's style, you know, yeah, yeah age guy. He's a cap of cig probably [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1096.14s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm looking at that and then I asked the detectives to show me the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1100.04s)]
*  Where the blood stains are well I go and I look and there were some cobwebs over the door [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1105.4s)]
*  So I could tell that that home hadn't that that area of the house hadn't been used [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1110.76s)]
*  Okay, just from the cobwebs and stuff. Okay, but when I opened the fridge, there was an intact hawks head in the fridge [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1115.16s)]
*  Mm-hmm with fur on it. Oh, I mean that's odd, you know [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1123.04s)]
*  And yeah, and then so then I look in the oven and the guys making cracklings in an oven now if you've ever made cracklings [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1126.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, you're stirring those in grease when you're baking cracklings on a Tuesday night and you save the hogshead to make hogshead cheese later [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1132.52s)]
*  You're gonna definitely have heart disease [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1139.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1141.68s)]
*  There's no foul play here fellas and that blood probably came when he was moving the hogshead [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1142.2s)]
*  From the kitchen to the refer I mean from the counter to the refrigerator from the actual hog you think yeah [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, again when you on your last limb for a snack, man, you know, yeah, that's crazy [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1152.96s)]
*  When you're baking cracklings, bro, you're gonna have high cholesterol at a minimum [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1159.62s)]
*  but you know again the blood stains triggered the law enforcement to call and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1164.1s)]
*  The fridge told me the story. Yeah as well as the way the guy lived. He smoked cigarettes. He had you know alcohol everywhere [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1169.94s)]
*  The papa was a rolling stone, you know, he [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1177.1399999999999s)]
*  That environment told me you know [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1180.3799999999999s)]
*  The what was going on with him, right? It gave you a lot of clues right there. Yeah cracklings [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1182.8999999999999s)]
*  You got to have those the heats got to be so high on cracklings man. You can't do it in an oven [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1188.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't think I've never tried it. I don't know but he was you know, he definitely tried to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1192.3s)]
*  Pull up how to make cracklings see if you could pull that I just want to get this recipe [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1197.82s)]
*  My sister would make them out there. They lived off of and Gonzalez [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1200.86s)]
*  So we make them you get a big large black pot, right? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1203.62s)]
*  You put it out in the yard. You got to cut that stuff up the fire under it [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1206.1399999999999s)]
*  You cut that fat up and then you put it in grease. Yeah, and you just constantly stir that grease [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1209.02s)]
*  Pour into a pot deep enough that the top of oil is at least six inches from the rim place over medium-high heat [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1215.22s)]
*  When the oil reaches 225 degrees on a deep fat frying thermometer add the pork cubes and start [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1221.26s)]
*  stirring to prevent clumping [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1229.02s)]
*  Yeah, so it's high oil. I guess you can bake them if you baked them long enough, but [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1230.58s)]
*  God that's risky though. Yeah, it's just it can't taste good. I don't know [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1236.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't imagine it because you got to really get them to pop and I just couldn't imagine them doing it well [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1240.66s)]
*  And you do dumb shit when you're drinking, you know, maybe it was one of those nights like hey, let's bake some cracklings [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1245.98s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? Let's give it a run. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know but did another that fella [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  Have a wife or do they seem kind of lonesome? No, he he was single. He did have a family children [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1255.18s)]
*  You know on scene, but he lived alone now say if you pull up on like let's go back to that water body, right? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1261.1000000000001s)]
*  What happens to a body when it's in water because I think sometimes a lot of people fantasize that's one of the fantasies [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1268.42s)]
*  I'm gonna find a body right now [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1274.34s)]
*  It's either in the woods by the interstate or I'm gonna walk down by a creek bank and there's gonna be a body right there [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1276.0s)]
*  I think that's some of the general fantasy of humans [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1281.4s)]
*  What does that body realistically look like depending on how long it's been in? Yeah, so, you know [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1284.42s)]
*  It bloats you get a lot of bloating in the water. Mm-hmm. The whole body puffs up [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1290.26s)]
*  Normally the tongue protrudes out [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1296.66s)]
*  You don't think about that the gases and the gases and the decomposure [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1299.5400000000002s)]
*  They know the body's sink and then they rise when when the gases start to fill up the body and that's when we find them [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1303.98s)]
*  A lot of times they'll be snagged in a in branches on a bayou or in the river [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1310.26s)]
*  But that body's gonna bloat a lot and then again turtles and other animals out in the water will start pecking at them. So [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1316.14s)]
*  It looks a little bit more traumatic than it than it is [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1324.3799999999999s)]
*  But if we're unsure we can always send that body to autopsy to try to determine [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1328.58s)]
*  Exactly what happened and they'll take them apart and a lot of times they'll cut into their heart and realize well [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1333.6599999999999s)]
*  This guy had a massive heart attack. I say, you know, so there was no foul play or he's full of drugs and there's no external trauma [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1338.6599999999999s)]
*  So nobody hit him in the back of the head [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1345.54s)]
*  And threw him in there. Mm-hmm [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1347.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, maybe pull up a little water bloat for us [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1350.4199999999998s)]

*  Ods and stuff. What's that? Has that changed the way you even approach the industry? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1657.02s)]
*  I mean, how busy is that gotten things? Yeah, that's um [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1661.42s)]
*  You know [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1665.26s)]
*  When I first started, you know 18 years ago, we would have occasional ods accidental ods [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1666.22s)]
*  um [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1672.7s)]
*  But that has increased by a thousand since fentanyl has hit the streets fentanyl and crystal meth [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1674.22s)]
*  The ods are every day every day [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1682.38s)]
*  You know, it affects every age group you can imagine [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1685.66s)]
*  You know the opioid epidemic came [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1689.6599999999999s)]
*  um [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1692.62s)]
*  And that you know that was started the the whole opioid thing was started when hospitals started using surveys [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1693.5s)]
*  to uh [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1700.86s)]
*  Take to compare themselves to other hospitals. It was called the presgaini [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1701.82s)]
*  And one of the the questions in that in that survey was how did we treat your pain? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1705.82s)]
*  so [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1711.1s)]
*  and then the reason behind the survey was [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1711.8999999999999s)]
*  Hospitals all have the same equipment [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1714.54s)]
*  You have the same MRI as the hospital 20 miles down the road all your equipment's the same [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1716.06s)]
*  But what can you do better than another and that's customer service [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1720.54s)]
*  So all these patients would get these satisfaction surveys in the mail and I worked in the hospitals and so we would we would actually skit things [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1724.1399999999999s)]
*  So when they got home, they would remember key words and they would they would rate us or they would give us a good rating [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1731.8999999999999s)]
*  For instance, do you have no did they have enough time for you in the hospital? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1737.8999999999999s)]
*  So we were instructed to say is there anything else I can do for you? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1741.74s)]
*  I have time so it was this uh [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1745.26s)]
*  It's a plan as a strategy. Wow. Yeah, and so then how did we treat your pain was another one and the pressgaini [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1748.14s)]
*  It was called yeah, and it was a I mean, it's a great program, you know [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1753.9s)]
*  It teaches people how to really people in hospitals how to really you know, go the extra mile for patients [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1757.98s)]
*  We do things that we don't think about you know, we close that door before we you know, do a test on you [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1763.42s)]
*  So you're not exposed [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1769.1s)]
*  Um, but we don't you don't really know that we're doing that so things like hey [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1770.62s)]
*  I'm going to close this door for your privacy and you know, it it's it's it was a great program [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1774.3s)]
*  But one of the things was uh pain control [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1778.9399999999998s)]
*  So you think that that was a do you think that that was the motive of the program? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1781.58s)]
*  Or do you think that that was just a side effect of the program? That was a side effect [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1785.26s)]
*  So you don't think that they strategize this program just in order to get people to be able to give them to for them to notice? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1789.02s)]
*  Okay for them to get that answer about the pain, right? No, no, not at all it and [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1795.5s)]
*  It was absolutely a side effect if you will of that, uh press gaining it's cold. Yeah, let's bring it up [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1800.62s)]
*  I don't know if that's still a [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1807.4199999999998s)]
*  Serve they still do surveys of christ, but in the 90s that that was one that [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1810.1399999999999s)]
*  98 percent of all hospitals used [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1815.8999999999999s)]
*  um a lot of hospitals were owned by the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1818.3799999999999s)]
*  The same corporation so you had five or six hospitals in your area and they would do side-by-side [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1821.34s)]
*  Comparisons of each other and we all wanted to [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1826.24s)]
*  Have the highest rating right to your hospital wants to go for the best rating [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1829.3600000000001s)]
*  We're ranked number five in the nation. We're ranked number three in the parish two in the state [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1832.5600000000002s)]
*  Exactly, so this is press gaining right here and they are get to know your patients like never before [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1837.04s)]
*  See patients from every angle to prioritize and predict their needs [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1842.64s)]
*  Um, you scroll down a little just want to see what it is. So it's about patient experience tools [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1847.04s)]
*  Yes, so this is a company that helps [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1852.4s)]
*  uh [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1855.6000000000001s)]
*  practitioners, I guess [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1856.72s)]
*  Know how to best treat their patients [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1858.32s)]
*  Is that right? Correct. Okay press game when you go to the hospital even today when you get home [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1861.6000000000001s)]
*  You'll get a survey in the mail. I see and then you know you fill out that survey and mail it back [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1866.48s)]
*  Same as when you call at&t and they say would you hold you know to complete this customer service? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1871.76s)]
*  Survey, but so then you know, how did we treat your pain was one of them? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1877.44s)]
*  And so then physicians started ordering more pain medication not intentionally to hurt the patient this this wasn't the the goal [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  But you'd get a patient with a broken arm and instead of getting 15 tablets on discharge [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1889.68s)]
*  They'd give you 60 so a lot of the opiate [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1895.6000000000001s)]
*  Addiction started from the over utilization of prescribing pain medication, you know a dentist might give you 40 [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1899.0400000000002s)]
*  Whereas the 40 hydrocodones or lortabs or oxycodones, you know the instead of giving you 10 [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1906.0s)]
*  They would you know give you 40 or 60 so the government came in [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1912.9599999999998s)]
*  With the opioid epidemic and they tamped that down and put in regulations though [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1916.9599999999998s)]
*  So we wouldn't hand out so many pain pain pills [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1921.04s)]
*  The addiction rose by 100 percent, but it took a long time for them to come in and do that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1925.52s)]
*  Yeah, it did and so because you guys were experiencing a lot of overdose death not so yeah [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1930.24s)]
*  Yes, but you know the overdoses [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1935.44s)]
*  Weren't necessarily from just taking hydro apap, you know [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1939.2s)]
*  There was always like a poly drug abuse meaning multiple drugs being used [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1942.96s)]
*  But those were still rare at the time. We didn't get as many overdoses as we do now, you know [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1947.2s)]
*  I miss crack the crack days were so much easier than the fentanyl days [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1953.68s)]
*  Because why is that? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1958.56s)]
*  Because it's that much more lethal [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1960.0s)]
*  Um, oh crack is yeah fentanyl [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1962.4s)]
*  Fentanyl is much more, you know, the crack epidemic was a thing [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1965.6s)]
*  um [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1969.6s)]
*  But then the the when the pain epidemic hit that's when we really started losing people [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1970.56s)]
*  So what's the difference between like a crack death and a fentanyl death? Well, I mean it's basically going to be a cardiac event [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1976.48s)]
*  Um fentanyl, you know, you stop breathing [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1983.44s)]
*  um, that's a very powerful drug the um [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1986.8s)]
*  The back to the the the opioid, um, the docs were giving out medication people were getting addicted and then the government came in and stopped it [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=1992.8s)]
*  And they just cut everybody off and they made it to where physicians could get in a lot of trouble if they overprescribed [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2001.76s)]
*  And then I think they came back after that just recently and said hey [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2008.16s)]
*  We didn't mean not to treat people with pain because then you have a lot of people turning to heroin [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2011.52s)]
*  You know when you're taking opiates and you're on them for you know, five or six years and you're addicted [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2016.4s)]
*  And then one day you just can't get any [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2022.0s)]
*  Um a lot of people turn to heroin we we we really didn't have a great, uh system to get people in to rehabs [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2024.48s)]
*  You know if you want to if you want to commit somebody for drug abuse [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2032.16s)]
*  They have to go voluntarily [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2036.64s)]
*  And you can imagine that not everyone wants to go another role of the coroner's office [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2038.56s)]
*  We have the ability to remove you from your we can take you and send you somewhere [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2043.52s)]
*  Against your will yeah, and that's a that's the other arm of the coroner's office. Oh, I didn't know that at all, but what but [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2048.72s)]
*  So you get but how do you get those calls because you think the coroner or death investigators are just getting called about death [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2054.7999999999997s)]
*  So who's calling you? Yeah law enforcement they they know that oh they say hey this guy over here. We need we think he should be [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2061.12s)]
*  51 50 or something. Yeah, he needs to be in a hospital [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2068.86s)]
*  Okay, we need to get him to an er and into a psych hospital. Can you guys help us with that? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2071.52s)]
*  Right so we yeah so that we fill out paperwork the coroner actually signs off on the paperwork [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2076.08s)]
*  And then the police can go and remove you against your will and bring you to an er [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2081.44s)]
*  But we send all these patients to the er and a lot of times they're let go [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2085.92s)]
*  You know I can have a 18 year old girl that's shooting heroin and smoking crack and drinking [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2090.0s)]
*  And she gets to the er and they say well, yeah, you have a problem, but drugs are your choice [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2096.8s)]
*  So therefore i'm going to discharge you and the the reasoning behind that is we have a broken system [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2100.96s)]
*  I don't know how you fix that but so then they get to the er [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2106.7200000000003s)]
*  And the er doctors know I can't force this person to go to rehab [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2109.92s)]
*  You know that if you want to quit it has to be your decision [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2113.6s)]
*  Um, so a lot of those patients are let go and then unfortunately we'll get a coroner call on an od [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2117.04s)]
*  From one of those exact patients that we sent to the er [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2123.12s)]
*  So you see a lot of repeat offender hypothetically it's repeat offenders when these people show back up [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  Or repeatedly have harmed themselves with drugs and then a lot of second third times. It's death. Absolutely. I mean the the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2131.3599999999997s)]
*  Most patients I say most patients a lot of patients have a psychiatric diagnosis [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2140.16s)]
*  So when there's a dual diagnosis, you can put them in a rehab [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2144.4799999999996s)]
*  Um in a psych facility, but even that is a five to six day stay and then they're discharged [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2147.6s)]
*  And then they have to get home and take their medication that was prescribed which they don't [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2152.56s)]
*  So then they end up coming back through their coroner's office and going back to the er [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2156.64s)]
*  You know some of these guys on drugs. It was one that really really [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2160.9599999999996s)]
*  That was really hard to deal with recently was a veteran [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2165.52s)]
*  I know his family [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  They they had played some audio recordings of this guy just crying at night [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2171.2s)]
*  um [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2176.56s)]
*  Saying he needed help [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2177.52s)]
*  But then he would turn to meth and get high and then refuse refuse help [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2179.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this guy had had kills under his belt, you know, and and [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2183.68s)]
*  We don't want to label people. Well, he's just a meth junkie [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2188.16s)]
*  I mean these people all have problems and they didn't they didn't grow up saying I want to be this person [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2190.88s)]
*  But this one in particular, you know went to iraq and killed some people and now he's back and he's messed up and [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  He can't make the right decisions and eventually he'll die [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2202.96s)]
*  But he has to ultimately agree to go get help so it's a hard process on some yeah [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2206.7200000000003s)]
*  We lose we lose people [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2214.16s)]
*  You know, yeah [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2216.0s)]
*  And it's tough waiting for somebody to get well enough or have enough of a breakthrough their own vision or perspective [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2216.4s)]
*  To see that they need help. That's the hardest thing to try and you can't really influence anybody, you know [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2223.36s)]
*  I mean you can but it's just [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2228.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear that people don't want to hear often you need help [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2231.12s)]
*  They just don't accept it, you know, or yeah, you're the drugged up sometimes [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2234.16s)]
*  Um, yeah, and you do interventions and stuff and sometimes people don't want that I tell families, you know [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2238.56s)]
*  Because we have them where you know, the families will send them they'll go to a psych unit [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2243.68s)]
*  Then they'll get out and they'll die either by suicide or drug overdose [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2248.96s)]
*  And a lot of times i'll tell families look you have to try [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2254.0s)]
*  You have to try you can't force your child to go to drug rehab [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2257.3599999999997s)]
*  A lot of people are nervous about [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2261.2000000000003s)]
*  Sending people because the sheriffs show up and they put you in a court and they bring you to the eor and a lot of families [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2263.36s)]
*  Just were scared to do it [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2268.48s)]
*  And I always tell them, you know, we we don't know the outcome of this but you have to try [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2270.48s)]
*  You have to get them [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2275.76s)]
*  In front of somebody professional and if they get out and they keep doing the same thing over and over at the end of the day [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2277.28s)]
*  You know, you tried. Yeah [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2282.32s)]
*  Yeah, man, that's such a battle. It's heartbreaking to see the effects of all that [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2284.88s)]
*  Um of all like the opioid epidemic and just the [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2288.88s)]
*  All the fentanyl deaths, but are you noticing less of those? Are you noticing? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2292.7200000000003s)]
*  No, so [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2297.1200000000003s)]
*  Fentanyl deaths are every day [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2298.32s)]
*  Every day and it's you know, I go out throughout the state throughout the parish and i've been giving lectures and i'd love to do more [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2300.32s)]
*  on fentanyl [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2308.48s)]
*  It's a hundred times stronger than morphine or I forget the exact the exact [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2310.8s)]
*  Uh [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2315.2799999999997s)]
*  Numbers on that but it's extremely potent overall drug overdose deaths rose from 2019 to 2021 with more than [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2316.48s)]
*  106,000 drug overdose deaths reported in 2021 [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2323.02s)]
*  Um, that was during the pandemic deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2326.24s)]
*  Primarily fentanyl continued to rise. So imagine a football stadium that holds a hundred thousand fans [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2331.12s)]
*  Okay, uh tiger stadium maybe almost pretty much almost [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2337.52s)]
*  So that's how many people we're losing a year the next time you watch a football game in a big stadium [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2341.6s)]
*  Just imagine that many bodies. Yeah, and and that's the ones we know about you know [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2347.28s)]
*  There's so many unknowns that we don't catch. Yeah, but we're losing that many americans to it and it's it's young kids [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2351.84s)]
*  Um, oh, it's unbelievable the the they can they they have pill presses now so I can take an oxycodone [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2358.8s)]
*  A real one and I can take a fake one and put it in front of a pharmacist that has 40 50 years experience [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2365.7s)]
*  And he can't tell me which one is real and which one is fake. Wow, and they do the same thing with xanax [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2373.7s)]
*  Um atarol [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2379.54s)]
*  So all these things kids take everybody has a crazy aunt and they've heard the word xanax before so you have a high school kid [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2381.14s)]
*  Maybe the the girls having boy troubles. Maybe she's on her period and a friend says hey take a half a xanax [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2387.9399999999996s)]
*  It'll help you relax and that one tablet is fatal. Yeah, you know and that happens because it's a pressed pill [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2393.62s)]
*  You're saying it's a pressed pill, right? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2399.06s)]
*  Yeah, and so pressed pills is where they basically replicate it, but they use fentanyl up in there, correct? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2400.8199999999997s)]
*  Because it is more powerful. It's cheaper to replicate than making the actual product [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2406.66s)]
*  Correct. You can't get the actual product so they make it look identical to the real thing [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2412.18s)]
*  Right and people don't know if you're buying especially you're some kid. You don't know [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2416.9s)]
*  No, you don't and [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2419.9399999999996s)]
*  You know what I was told was you can bring back you can smuggle across the border a coffee bag of fentanyl [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2421.46s)]
*  Versus, you know 20 pounds of meth and you're going to have a higher profit margin on that little bag of coffee [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2428.1s)]
*  Which contains fentanyl than you would on all that meth [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2434.5s)]
*  So the cartels are sending in loads and loads of of fentanyl and it's it's it snowballed into heroin [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2437.22s)]
*  You know, so we see when we were younger, you know movie stars did heroin [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2444.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know we didn't see much of that coming up but now I feel like you'd have money to do it [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2447.94s)]
*  Right now it's everywhere. You know the some of the people you just you'd be amazed at how many [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2452.58s)]
*  good-looking young kids [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2458.98s)]
*  Do heroin but actually it's not heroin, you know, there's one form of heroin called china white [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2461.6200000000003s)]
*  Which is a snortable form of heroin. Yeah people brag about that a lot in the recovery meetings [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2466.58s)]
*  Yeah, like using that. Yeah, you can snort it. You don't have to shoot it. So what they're doing is they're selling it but it's fentanyl [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2470.6600000000003s)]
*  Fentanyl comes in a microgram microgram dose. So when you get a milligram [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2477.2400000000002s)]
*  Dose, I mean that's just a fatal a fatal dose [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2482.52s)]
*  So we're seeing it every day and when you roll up on a case like that, right? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2485.4s)]
*  Where are those cases at? What does that look like? What does that body look like as you come up on it? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2489.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so they're normally [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2494.28s)]
*  In a natural position on the couch or in bed [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2496.36s)]
*  But we know, you know this person has had repeated [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2500.6800000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2503.88s)]
*  Run-ins with the law [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2505.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, a lot of times we'll we'll see the evidence, you know, they have a belt [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2506.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, they've been shooting up. They have their belt they have their syringes and again [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2510.92s)]
*  Nobody touches the body until we get there. Um, and we can and I can talk to the family and get it out of them [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2514.44s)]
*  Fentanyl is the worst that we've ever seen and now they're mixing it with other drugs like xylazine [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2520.92s)]
*  Which is a vet drug you hear it referred to as trank [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2526.04s)]
*  This is creating these massive ulcers on people but they're even having to make fentanyl stronger [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2529.48s)]
*  When someone dies on fentanyl [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2535.48s)]
*  The the users in the area you think they'd be scared of it [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2538.12s)]
*  Like I don't want to I don't want to get that batch but they want it [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2541.4s)]
*  They want to know where that person got that batch so they can get a better buzz from it [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2544.28s)]
*  oh, dude one time I was with my dad and he um [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2548.92s)]
*  Would he would take us to the park and he would sleep in his car while we would play or whatever [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2552.6800000000003s)]
*  and uh [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2557.16s)]
*  He gave us like a bunch like a case of kitkat bars or whatever [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2558.44s)]
*  And we're breaking them and throwing them out to this squirrel, right? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2561.96s)]
*  And the squirrel ate a bunch of it and died, right? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2565.32s)]
*  And because I guess they can't have chocolate or whatever but in the distance dude [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2568.68s)]
*  You saw like 30 other squirrels hopping over. Yeah, and by the end of the day bro, we'd [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2572.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I have to remember that when we squirrel hunt we'd oh, yeah, bro. You get a kitkat [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2577.96s)]
*  I don't know if it works with that new white chocolate one [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2582.44s)]
*  But I know like the original one the old school one bro [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2584.52s)]
*  I mean you could look in the distance of the park and you just saw them all just hopping over [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2587.48s)]
*  You know don't tell somebody from louisiana that kitkats are gonna skyrocket. That's what we do. We squirrel hunt [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2591.96s)]
*  Oh, dude, you'll shoot anything if it's in a freaking tree out there. There's a parish [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2597.64s)]
*  If a rope swing gets a little wild somebody will gun it down [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2602.28s)]
*  There's a parish in louisiana and up until literally a few years ago the school board opening day squirrel season the school board closed down [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2605.16s)]
*  So everyone could go in the woods on that opening day. I mean, can you imagine that the whole town? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2612.92s)]
*  Is absent on opening squirrel season? Yeah everybody all the men and kids are in the woods and all the women are in the bars [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2618.1200000000003s)]
*  That's a party, you know [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2624.36s)]
*  That's a party all the squirrels. But yeah [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2626.28s)]
*  So the fentanyl death has been high that's been really really crazy. It's out of control. Yeah, it's out of control [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2629.1600000000003s)]
*  Odds used to be you know death is seasonal. We have different deaths in different parts of the year. We know what to expect [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2633.56s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2639.48s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2640.6s)]
*  Wintertime you're gonna get your um, you know a lot of naturals because the weather's changing [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2642.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you're gonna get hunting accidents, you know cajuns falling out of tree stands, right breaking their neck, you know, they they you know [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2647.64s)]
*  Everything imaginable in the woods you got you got cajuns with guns in the woods. So [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2655.08s)]
*  Then you get into [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2661.48s)]
*  The springtime weather starts getting nice in louisiana. We don't have many many months of nice weather. So then here comes the motorcycles [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2663.0s)]
*  So we started getting motorcycle deaths a lot of organ donors right there lots in the springtime [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2670.7599999999998s)]
*  A buddy of mine's office is full of motorcycle helmets and I asked him when I'm like, why don't you have motorcycle? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2675.4s)]
*  I mean literally around his whole office and he run an autopsy clinic and he said I just keep the helmets on all the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2680.44s)]
*  Ones we do [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2686.52s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a little bit of a collector's item. He's got going [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2688.04s)]
*  Yeah, so those all had living people in them that died on motorbikes. Absolutely [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2691.08s)]
*  Yeah motorcycles are dangerous and i'd love to own one [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2694.8399999999997s)]
*  But in louisiana, we have so many roads that that pop out on major highways and you're doing 60 miles 70 miles an hour [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2697.56s)]

*  So a family that uh mom and dad have three or four kids [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2741.48s)]
*  Three or four kids are killed two days before christmas in a car accident [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2745.48s)]
*  I mean, how do you deal with that as a parent? It's hard enough to lose one much less all [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2748.76s)]
*  But again, that's the holidays we we get these these heart-wrenching cases [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2754.6s)]
*  Um, I always tell people to expect the unexpected and during the holiday time. You really have to be careful and louisiana [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2760.12s)]
*  We drink 24 7, you know [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2767.4s)]
*  All day. Oh, you know, it's just it's just what we do in louisiana [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2770.28s)]
*  And so driving a lot of people going to christmas parties and events and pull out drinking and driving [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2773.7200000000003s)]
*  there's you know, there's preventable deaths and [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2779.2400000000002s)]
*  Oftentimes i'll tell friends and family that you know if you have to go somewhere [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2782.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's a two-lane highway versus a four-lane [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2787.0s)]
*  Even though it might take 15 minutes longer to get to your destination take that bigger highway [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2789.72s)]
*  Where you're not one-on-one with traffic because i'd guess that's 70 percent of the cars you're passing [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2794.68s)]
*  Or drivers under the influence and that's all year long. I mean you realize how close you come to other cars when you're on a back road [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2801.08s)]
*  You know trying to get somewhere well, especially in louisiana, bro. Yeah, there's no lights the roads are dark [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2808.92s)]
*  And also I remember even back in the day man if when you got out of work, you got a freaking beer [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2814.6s)]
*  Yeah, you have you see people all the time driving home at the stock going across the causeway or something [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2819.6400000000003s)]
*  They wave at you and they show you their beer bro. It was part of it's part of the culture [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2825.0s)]
*  I don't know about anywhere else [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  But in louisiana we have places where you can pull up drive in windows and get margaritas. That's just common [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2830.36s)]
*  Or you could stick your head in a stranger's fucking house window and they'll put a side of brandy in your throat [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2835.7999999999997s)]
*  That's right. You know if you need it [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2840.8399999999997s)]
*  So yeah, that's just louisiana bro. It's just part of it. You know, I think um, so that makes road road safety that much more dangerous [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2842.8399999999997s)]

*  That was shot [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2903.64s)]
*  Years ago and it was such a surreal thing to zip up [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2905.32s)]
*  An officer in a uniform. He had the black stripe across his badge. I guess that was around 2015 when they started doing those [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2908.7599999999998s)]
*  Um black stripes on their badges and it was such a surreal event [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2916.2799999999997s)]

*  Yeah, if you had to roll up on somebody and then it's somebody you know [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2931.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing is when i'm getting to a car accident, you know in [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2933.56s)]
*  my hometown, um [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2939.08s)]
*  I start seeing cars that I recognize and as i'm walking up to that [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2941.16s)]
*  To the wreck, you know, I I might see a nissan ultima or something. Oh, yeah for a minute your heart drops like [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2945.24s)]

*  so [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2958.2799999999997s)]
*  They had moved in from tennessee [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2959.24s)]
*  And he had lost his wife unexpectedly and uh, that was really hard [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2961.56s)]
*  They had you know, three young children at the time and uh, it was hard dealing with that case. Uh, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2965.8799999999997s)]
*  13 year old girl [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2972.52s)]
*  Taught me more [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2974.44s)]
*  That night than I mean still to this day when it was right around christmas [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2975.88s)]
*  And I can remember having to take them to the er to show them their mother [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2979.96s)]
*  and um [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2984.12s)]
*  It was tough. She said, uh, mr. Tobey all I want for christmas is my mom [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2985.8s)]
*  And you know, we we put so much effort into christmas and presents and holidays and here I have this 13 year old girl [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2990.28s)]
*  It really puts things into perspective for you, you know [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=2997.4s)]
*  Um and still to this day I do my job because I was able to save my best friend's life [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3000.44s)]
*  By being able to remove him, uh when he was depressed, you know suicide is real [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3005.96s)]
*  um [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3011.0800000000004s)]
*  And he ended up getting help and I had to I had to help him get help [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3012.1200000000003s)]
*  But you know, I feel if I wouldn't have reacted after that event that he may not be with us anymore [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3015.88s)]
*  So that's that's what keeps me going in this [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3021.88s)]
*  In this case, so there's some personal involvement there in certain situations [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3024.92s)]
*  Your ability to you guys are like, oh well if there's drug use here [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3028.78s)]
*  I can help send this person or you know help commandeer them in a direction [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3031.82s)]
*  Maybe that could help them if they're willing to go if there's like, uh, if i'm associated with the [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3035.34s)]
*  Someone who's passed and i'm associated with a friend. I can lead them into um therapy or keep tabs on them [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3041.82s)]
*  Or i've seen enough instances where you you statistically know. Hey bud [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3048.2200000000003s)]
*  There's probably a 50 chance. You're going to stay alive after you've lost this person in your life [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3053.5s)]
*  you [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3057.98s)]
*  You really need to keep tabs on yourself or get some help. Absolutely. Wow [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3059.02s)]
*  absolutely, um [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3063.2400000000002s)]
*  That's funny. I didn't know the coroner [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3064.94s)]
*  You know, I didn't know some of the access points that they had and some of like the direction signs that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3066.46s)]
*  Uh that the coroner's office can point people in you know, you don't think about that [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3071.9s)]
*  You just think about somebody rolling up, you know and making a call, you know, right, you know satan's [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3076.38s)]
*  Line judge, you know you rolling up and you're just the referee [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3082.62s)]
*  You call them into heaven or you call them out, you know only the coroner can arrest the sheriff [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3085.5s)]
*  and that's [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3091.1800000000003s)]
*  from [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3092.1400000000003s)]
*  the early on you know [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3093.1800000000003s)]
*  1900s if not earlier [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3095.32s)]
*  So when a sheriff the sheriff needs to be arrested only the coroner can go out and do it, which is interesting [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3096.86s)]
*  um [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3102.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's all kinds of things that we do [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3103.6600000000003s)]
*  There's also sexual violence and when rapes are involved that goes to the coroner's office and they do [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3105.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, we we normally send people to get rape kits done but uh domestic violence and things like that also fall under the coroner umbrella [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3110.62s)]
*  We do a lot of things [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3118.8599999999997s)]
*  And is it straight rapes or gay rapes like do they all happen? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3121.1s)]
*  um [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3125.02s)]
*  It would be uh [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3126.22s)]
*  Well, I guess they all happen [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3128.8599999999997s)]
*  but [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3131.66s)]
*  I don't know how to answer that one [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3132.94s)]
*  Uh when a woman is assaulted and it could be woman or man. Absolutely. Wow. Absolutely [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3134.7s)]
*  We'll refer them. Um, you know to a to an er where there's the appropriate staff to do that [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3140.46s)]
*  Yeah, we're rural. We're a rural coroner's office, you know, so now how can they trump? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3145.98s)]
*  How can somebody trick you? How do they trick the coroner? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3151.2599999999998s)]
*  Say if somebody say there's a police officer or something, right say or somebody in a town wants to [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3154.62s)]
*  trick the coroner a body is deceased. Ah, okay, and they want to [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3159.18s)]
*  And maybe they did it right or there's some espionage going on [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3165.42s)]
*  How do they trick how do they get it past the corner because i've heard that if you can trick the coroner [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3169.7400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes you could get away with murder [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3175.7400000000002s)]
*  That would be a true statement, but it's hard to trick the coroner, right? Um [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3178.46s)]
*  I don't know that well [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3183.58s)]
*  if someone does we had a case for instance where um [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3185.1800000000003s)]
*  The the wife shot the man and he was laying there deceased. He was a farmer [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3189.58s)]
*  There was a shovel on the ground and you know [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3194.54s)]
*  Uh farmers don't put their tools up [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3196.94s)]
*  Dirty, they're going to clean that shovel before they put it up. So there's a muddy shovel laying on the side of a deceased man [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3200.38s)]
*  and uh the the wife said it was self-defense [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3207.98s)]
*  so [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3211.74s)]
*  When we walked up to the shovel we just picked it up [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3212.94s)]
*  And dropped it from you know, two or three feet and all the dirt fell off [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3215.82s)]
*  So you mean to tell me you shot him twice he we could see that he grabbed his wounds [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3219.66s)]
*  And so did he lay that shovel down? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3226.54s)]
*  Nice and gently after you pumped a few in him, you know, or did you stage that there? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3229.1s)]
*  so things like that, you know that that [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3234.14s)]
*  Always don't make sense. You have to really think about some of those things [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3238.14s)]
*  But we have ways we can tell if let's say you strangled someone or you used a pillow, you know, there's no [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3241.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, that's a that's one that's often thought about [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3247.02s)]
*  When we're doing our assessment, we can see a thing called patikii [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3249.74s)]
*  So it's basically retinal hemorrhaging [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3253.5s)]
*  So when we look into the eyes, we'll see little red dots and we know that that person was strangled [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3255.9s)]
*  Or suffocated [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3261.02s)]
*  So let's just say I you know, I kill somebody and then I hang them [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3262.6200000000003s)]
*  well [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3266.38s)]
*  I can tell if they if they were breathing when they were [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3267.98s)]
*  Hung versus not and that's all based on that retinal hemorrhaging really. Yeah, so so we have a lot of uh [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3271.1800000000003s)]
*  Another thing is uh, lividity the liver mortis [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3279.1000000000004s)]
*  So once if you die laying on your back [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3282.46s)]
*  Um after a few hours your your your body will appear red on the surface [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3285.5s)]
*  That's laying on the ground because blood when it stops flowing drops [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3290.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so if I walk into a house and you're laying on your stomach, but your back is red [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3293.58s)]
*  Well, somebody moved that body for sure [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3299.42s)]
*  You know so we can tell when people try to you know, and a lot of times it's they rolled them over to do cpr [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3302.38s)]
*  You know most of the time it's innocent, but there's ways to tell so that's when the forensics come into play [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3308.46s)]
*  You know, we we look for deception when we're talking to people we get stories from family members and even social media [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3315.1s)]
*  you'd be surprised that since the [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3322.14s)]
*  Uh evolution of social media that how much that helps us [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3324.7s)]
*  Yeah, I saw in that they had that case in south carolina that murdoch case or something [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3328.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, saw that or not where the man allegedly killed I think he was convicted of shooting his wife and [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3332.38s)]
*  son [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3337.6600000000003s)]
*  But they had some social media of the kids [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3338.86s)]
*  Where it was just it had been a few minutes earlier and they could hear the dad's voice in the background [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3342.6200000000003s)]
*  So they determined [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3347.02s)]
*  That they had been in the same space at the same time or something [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3348.6200000000003s)]
*  Cell phones, you know facebook, you know [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3352.46s)]
*  I have i've had a case where the guy posted i'm sweating like a whore in church [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3355.34s)]
*  And then he's found deceased and he's holding his chest [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3360.22s)]
*  Well, that tells me he had a heart attack after I examined him and ruled out foul play, you know [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3362.94s)]
*  Maybe maybe an adult saying man, you know people like to say, you know how bad they feel on social media [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3368.2999999999997s)]
*  My legs killing me today. Well, we can tell if they threw a blood clot [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3374.3799999999997s)]
*  By so when somebody throws a blood clot they have this cyanotic or bluish color from the nipple line up [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3378.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's that tells us okay. They threw a blood clot with stroll blood clot [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3385.18s)]
*  well, so [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3388.78s)]
*  basically a piece of fat [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3390.46s)]
*  Gets clogged up in your pulmonary and cardiovascular system and you die [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3392.46s)]
*  I mean there's it could happen to any one of us at any second of the day. Oh god [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3396.86s)]
*  I mean you throw a blood clot. It's called a pulmonary embolism. And what do you do right when it happens? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3401.6600000000003s)]
*  What do you do if you want to live? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3405.9s)]
*  You start cpr [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3408.3s)]
*  But sometimes you can't save them. I mean most of the time it's really hard now [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3410.1400000000003s)]
*  Um, there are tests that can determine if you're likely to have one [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3414.7000000000003s)]
*  So they start you on blood thinners. Okay, you know very common that people are on blood thinners people with heart disease [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3419.26s)]
*  um [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3424.78s)]
*  Though we can manage that with blood thinners, but you can't stop them all depending on the size of the clot [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3425.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's called the dvt deep vein thrombosis and [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3431.5s)]
*  Majority of people in louisiana. What happens is the veins in the legs narrow [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3435.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah, i've seen and that's from anything from nicotine to poor, you know, uh, high cholesterol bad shrimp [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3440.06s)]

*  them but [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3466.78s)]
*  You know, we'll look at social media and the person might say, you know [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3468.94s)]
*  Hey, I just recently had a surgery on my leg or my knee's been throbbing or my legs are throbbing or my calf is [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3472.38s)]

*  You know into very basic stuff like home appearance body appearance, you know weight were they compliant with their medicine? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3766.24s)]
*  Did they see their doctor? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3773.9199999999996s)]

*  There's so many things that that we can tell [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3778.3999999999996s)]
*  about a [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3781.6s)]
*  Someone that's deceased now. What about like a suicide like say there's like a hanging or something, you know [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3783.2799999999997s)]
*  What's that kind of how what does a body look like I feel so morbid asking about some of this [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3788.48s)]
*  Yeah, well how much would you be surprised what bodies look like from certain events? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3795.44s)]
*  That's what I think i'm because in my mind. I think you I envision walking up on a body and it's [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3801.6800000000003s)]
*  Still like oh, yeah, there's you know, that's jerry, right? You know [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3807.6800000000003s)]
*  But would you even know a lot of times who the person is? Absolutely. You can tell who they are [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3810.7200000000003s)]
*  Things that change in their eyes that we call that fixed and dilated, okay [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3816.24s)]
*  Their eyes are open and staring into space their pupils have dilated [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3820.48s)]
*  So, you know their their face kind of has a different appearance or we can tell by their eyes that they're not with us [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3826.4s)]
*  That's actually what he's looking at there is the retinal hemorrhaging [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3833.52s)]
*  So if you try to smug, uh, if you try to suffocate someone or when they hang they'll have those [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3837.04s)]
*  retinal hemorrhages from [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3843.28s)]
*  from the [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3845.2s)]
*  From the veins in your eyes [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3847.04s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, you can't breathe so it causes those hemorrhages to form but [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3848.72s)]
*  Bodies look like bodies you can tell you know, it's [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3853.52s)]
*  Suicides are tough. Um [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3857.18s)]
*  You know, there's uh [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3859.8399999999997s)]
*  They're supposed to leave the body hanging [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3861.68s)]
*  Or in its natural state until we get there [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3864.16s)]
*  We need to look at the ligature marks, which is actually the rope where they made the knot [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3866.96s)]
*  Where's it at and then of course it bruises the body so when you have a perfectly symmetrical [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3871.44s)]
*  Line on their neck [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3877.92s)]
*  You can tell if somebody maybe grabbed the wire and choked them and used force to do that because it's an even line [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3879.2000000000003s)]
*  But when it's not even and the ligature mark is consistent with how they were hanging [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3885.04s)]
*  Then we can tell and there's you know, either there should be petechia. So we know that this person [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3890.0s)]
*  Died by hanging [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3896.8s)]
*  One of the you know, and we use humor and it's it sounds bad, but we use humor to get through some of these cases [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3898.56s)]
*  No, we had we had a police officer interview and he said the same thing [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3904.64s)]
*  He goes sometimes you'll see cops standing around laughing and they have to do it [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3906.96s)]
*  You have to because what you're dealing with is is really hard to see so [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3910.64s)]
*  We're not you don't pick on the you know, you don't make jokes about the deceased per se but you know [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3915.2s)]
*  You joke with the officers and you try to lighten the mood some everybody can relax a little bit more [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3920.32s)]
*  Or and one thing for hangings is you always put the rookie on the front of the body [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3926.3199999999997s)]
*  So when you have to cut a body down [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3931.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, you can't just cut them and let them drop you want to protect their body [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3935.6s)]
*  So you put the rookie cop in the front and so when you cut that rope, you gotta catch it that last little bit of air [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3939.52s)]
*  Comes out of their mouth [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3946.72s)]
*  And so that's the worst place to be standing is when you're actually removing someone from a rope because they exhale [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3948.24s)]
*  Oh, that's that last puff, huh? It's that last. Yeah, it's like a fart bit out of the front exactly [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3953.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's and it's rough. So oh, yeah, it's a long one brother [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3958.0s)]
*  So when you say hey, you know [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3961.12s)]
*  Put john on the front everybody that has experience knows it's not where you want to be [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3963.2s)]
*  Who catches them you got to catch them? Well, the you know [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3968.24s)]
*  Everybody kind of helps who's there whoever is around? Oh, I thought it was like the bouquet at a wedding or something [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3971.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes it is [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3976.56s)]
*  Um, we we rely on the fire department and those guys do a great job. We have bodies that are you know, um [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3978.72s)]
*  house fires or or more more so, um [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3985.52s)]
*  Motor vehicle accidents where the body's been burned beyond recognition and they're stuck to the seat [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3989.12s)]
*  You know we can always call out the fire department and those guys come and you know [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3994.48s)]
*  Cut bodies out of cars and they'll help us put them in the body bags same as as you know [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=3998.48s)]
*  Decomposure, you know you get bodies that that have been in a home with no electricity for three or four days or weeks [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4003.12s)]
*  And the body is basically liquefied really. I mean it's yeah [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4009.68s)]
*  It's like a skeleton with like a puddle near or what is it? Like is it? Yeah, it's you know, it's it's [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4013.68s)]
*  Like really sunburned and bloated [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4019.92s)]
*  And seeping fluid [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4022.7200000000003s)]
*  And um the worst smell you could imagine. I mean everybody says when you smell death, you'll you'll know it if you smell it again [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4024.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, but you know, you're scraping those bodies up [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4031.52s)]
*  It's tough, you know, and sometimes you you know, it's a large person. You got to get the fire department out [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4034.88s)]
*  Recently, I had one that was up a staircase that uh, like kind of like the one you have here that spins up [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4039.84s)]
*  And the person was 300 pounds. So we had to call in some extra muscle to get that subject [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4045.52s)]
*  Down, you know, so fire department really comes out and helps us [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4050.64s)]
*  And how big is a body bag if it's a body big y'all make big bags [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4054.4s)]
*  Yeah, they make you know small medium large and extra large, you know for those people you ever needed to you ever needed to do double [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4057.84s)]
*  Bag somebody. Um, yeah, it depends on the body bag itself [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4064.32s)]
*  We can do things to you know when it's really messy, uh suicides [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4069.76s)]
*  Uh gunshots to the head we can wrap the heads in bags before we put them in the body bags [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4074.32s)]
*  And things like that and that body bag in some ways is a very very sacred thing not sacred [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4079.92s)]
*  That's the wrong choice of words, but that's where all the evidence is [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4084.88s)]
*  So if you're working a homicide when you put that body in that body bag and seal it only we can do that [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4087.6800000000003s)]
*  And once it's sealed it's not allowed to be broken until it gets to the autopsy facility [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4093.36s)]
*  Because you'll have evidence on that body [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4098.400000000001s)]
*  You know even the maybe the sheets they were laying in and all that can go into a body bag [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4100.8s)]
*  And we've had cases where the funeral homes, uh, you know for whatever reason wanted my new body bag [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4105.52s)]
*  So they would take the person out of the body bag and put them in an old one [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4111.84s)]
*  That's patched up with duct tape and send them to autopsy and you can't do that just to save the money [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4116.08s)]
*  Is they wanted to keep the bag? Yeah, that's a nice bag. I'm going to keep that one and throw them in this one [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4120.4800000000005s)]
*  You can't do that. That's that's that's really important evidence. You know, so [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4124.08s)]
*  Not you know [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4129.76s)]
*  Body bags are or an important thing that we use sometimes [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4131.52s)]
*  It's just to get the body out where there's a lot of people around [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4134.8s)]
*  So we'll put them in a body bag and or on the side of the road [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4137.92s)]
*  We'll have them put into body bags, but they're also uh used in the collection of evidence [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4140.4800000000005s)]
*  And so when you open a body bag out and everything in there and an officer walks through the body bag [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4145.280000000001s)]
*  It's like man, you just walked through my my evidence [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4150.240000000001s)]
*  Are you shocked sometimes by like the ineptitude sometimes of all of certain newbies or just whatever on forces? Yeah, and you know [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4153.4400000000005s)]
*  You learn to deal with it not people just don't know they don't know what they don't know agree man [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4161.04s)]
*  But i've had you know, i've had [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4165.200000000001s)]
*  So when I see an officer struggling in a home and the smell is really bad [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4167.6s)]
*  If I see you struggling i'm going to slow down because I can deal with it [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4172.400000000001s)]
*  I i've trained myself to where the the smells and things don't bother me [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4176.400000000001s)]
*  But you know, i'll watch that officer kind of eyes are getting watery. Their their face is red [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4181.120000000001s)]
*  They don't like where they're at and i'll kind of slow my investigation down like what's his date of birth and oh [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4186.08s)]
*  Let me go dig for that. So just as a way to kind of help them. Well, no, i'm put them through it [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4191.280000000001s)]
*  I put them through it, you know, i'll slow down when I see them struggling [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4196.08s)]
*  You're gonna make them put them on the grill a little. Yeah, that's right. That's right [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4199.28s)]
*  You know, do you know where his last address was and they go like oh my god [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4203.2s)]
*  Oh, I just want to get out of here, you know, but i've had officers throw up on bodies [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4207.04s)]
*  Really right on top of the body. Yeah, and we're sending that to autopsy, you know [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4212.08s)]
*  So it's like you just put all your dna [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4215.68s)]
*  On there. Oh, it's like a baptism at orbeez baby right there. That's horrible [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4217.92s)]
*  Yeah, well speaking of orbeez we can talk about that one later but what happened there was a death at orbeez [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4222.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah and laugh yet. Oh, of course, they found a lady in the cooler did they? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we got the meat, huh? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4226.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean poor thing though. She she was she was uh [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4232.72s)]
*  She was stuck in there [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4237.120000000001s)]

*  right and the late the last thing that I can do is be helpful to [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4393.04s)]
*  The people are gonna find my body and to the coroner's office. What's the best way for me to die? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4397.6s)]
*  to make it easier on [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4404.16s)]
*  whoever's gonna [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4406.320000000001s)]
*  The best to make it easy on you guys and the staff. Well, I guess, uh [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4408.88s)]
*  Die in a bed, you know, okay, that that's the easiest way. That's the best way. It's clean. You have covers over you [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4413.6s)]
*  It's easy for the family. Yeah families oftentimes want to see their loved one [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4419.68s)]
*  We have to clean them up to a degree. Sometimes they can't see them, you know, because it's such a morbid [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4423.76s)]
*  picture [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4429.6s)]
*  But you know, um dying in bed is very common on your back [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4431.12s)]
*  Um [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4435.52s)]
*  One time I had a guy a guy died standing up and i'll never forget that [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4436.72s)]
*  They called me out to a an apartment complex somewhere. And so as i'm walking into the to the scene with one of the sheriffs a friend [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4441.28s)]
*  of mine [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4448.64s)]
*  They're like well, that's him and we're not quite in the house yet. And he said he's standing right there [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4449.92s)]
*  And I said, what do you mean? He's standing with a guy died standing up [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4454.32s)]
*  And I for a minute, I thought they were messing with me. I'm like y'all y'all y'all gotta be messing with me [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4457.84s)]
*  So I even like tapped him on the leg before I yes, you know [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4463.6s)]
*  He had just the way he had fallen he was standing up at a sink and his head [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4467.04s)]
*  Just kind of landed on the he just kind of wedged himself in and his legs were locked and that's how we found him [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4471.28s)]
*  That was so odd [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4476.88s)]
*  You know [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4478.4s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah, to be really just kind of locked in there [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4479.44s)]
*  He's just getting his steps in I guess [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4483.04s)]
*  I don't know if he was brushing his teeth or what that was but oh, I didn't I didn't believe him [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4485.76s)]
*  I'm like you that can't be him and they were like i'm telling you he's standing up [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4490.32s)]
*  Well, that's that's one that's one for the books [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4494.24s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4496.32s)]
*  Because what are the odds that it's like when you watch those videos or there's people trying to throw a bottle in the air [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4496.48s)]
*  And make it land, you know, right, right? I've only had one died standing up in 18 years. Oh, wow [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4500.08s)]
*  So it's a rarity. That's very rare. Yeah in my opinion [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4505.44s)]
*  Now and how tough is it like you like if there's ants do you guys ever deal with animal animalia death? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4508.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so do you guys this corner deal with that too or no? Yeah, we deal with all all deaths [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4515.04s)]
*  so [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4520.48s)]
*  Uh now don't get me wrong [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4521.28s)]
*  We've had people call us because they have a dead dog or they got bit by a dog and it's like, oh you call in [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4522.88s)]
*  The coroner's office. I yeah go to the er. Yeah, call your neighbor and call him an asshole. Yeah, you know, that's what's happened [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4527.599999999999s)]
*  But no, um animals well, so if you die in a home that's locked with animals, you're those animals will eat you [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4533.36s)]
*  Really fast, especially a cat dogs will hold out [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4541.5199999999995s)]
*  Until they have nothing left to eat but a cat will remove your head in 24 hours [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4545.360000000001s)]
*  And i'm not talking i'm talking literally hair on the floor. No head [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4549.6s)]
*  and nibbling into their chest [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4554.16s)]
*  Um even cats that were loved by their owners or is it just cats? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4556.56s)]
*  No, you think were had something with the owner and they're and they're gonna say this is my time [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4560.16s)]
*  No, they're they're absolutely feeding on you [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4565.68s)]
*  You know, I don't care how much you love that cat and that cat loved you [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4568.400000000001s)]
*  He's gonna eat you [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4571.44s)]
*  And you know, sometimes we get to cases where there's uh, you can tell that the cat or dog had been nibbling [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4572.96s)]
*  You know, it might be on the face or the cheek or so, uh the toes but then sometimes [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4578.48s)]
*  It's unbelievable. I mean one of it was one of my first cases and [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4584.32s)]
*  I just never never imagined that they could do that much damage [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4589.04s)]
*  Smaller dogs now a lab a lab won't the labs for some reason [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4593.28s)]
*  Don't eat their owners, you know unless they're locked in for months, I guess they would but I find it more weenie dogs [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4597.200000000001s)]

*  But the body's so frail at that point, you know [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4767.139999999999s)]
*  What is the do you think you have some? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4770.58s)]
*  Infatuation with death. Why are you able to handle this sort of thing? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4773.759999999999s)]
*  I couldn't handle some of the images that we pulled up right? I mean really you know, like [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4776.9s)]
*  what what makes you think you're able to [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4782.0199999999995s)]
*  digest that visually and um [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4784.48s)]
*  Emotionally and everything and how does it digest for you? Yeah, you know [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4787.44s)]
*  I started health care really young [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4791.299999999999s)]
*  in life [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4793.86s)]
*  high school [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4795.139999999999s)]
*  All my friends were taking shop and I decided to take a nursing aid class [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4796.820000000001s)]
*  I figured i'd be able to bathe the girls. Well that didn't work out so well that body shop homie [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4800.1s)]
*  You know what i'm talking about? I should have took shop but that would work [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4804.42s)]
*  But always had a fascination with health care and then I went into other things and at one point [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4808.9800000000005s)]
*  Cardiopulmonary respiratory therapy, so we managed life support systems [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4814.0s)]
*  So okay, so then you're getting close to death. So yeah edge right there or t does deals with trauma [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4818.1s)]
*  You know, we're the airway in that regard so we're involved in in every traumatic death rt when you say respiratory [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4824.5s)]
*  Therapists are always in the er working for major codes and core accidents and things like that [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4831.6s)]
*  So you were around a lot of that? So yeah, I mean we've managed the life support system [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4837.06s)]
*  Sometimes we have to pull the plug or turn the machine off [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4840.740000000001s)]
*  And uh, that's what you say. You'd have to actually pull the plug. Yeah. Well you turn them you just turn the power off [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4844.34s)]
*  but yeah, um [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4848.900000000001s)]
*  You think you'd at least pull the plug like at least it's like eventually you do [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4851.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean you have to take the machine out but [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4854.179999999999s)]
*  You know terminating life support on somebody. Um [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4856.58s)]
*  By the time you're at that stage, they've done uh brain [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4860.58s)]
*  Tests to see if there's any brain activity and these people don't want to live [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4864.179999999999s)]
*  On a machine, you know, it's not like they're alive and talking to you at that stage. But again, we see all you know, we [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4869.379999999999s)]
*  We see a lot of trauma and i've always had this uh, i've always wanted to see I wonder what paramedics and police see [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4876.9s)]
*  Um, you know, I wonder what what people look like when they don't make it to the eor [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4884.179999999999s)]
*  um, I can remember having a [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4889.139999999999s)]
*  My brother was in the iraq war the first one a long time ago and he'd brought back some pictures [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4892.419999999999s)]
*  And he had some pictures of extremities and things and I was just fascinated to see that [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4897.46s)]
*  I don't know why I was born that way. I just I but I was really fascinated to see some of that [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4901.78s)]
*  And then a la carte, huh? Yeah, and so then later in health care and seeing trauma [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4906.74s)]
*  We don't you know for someone that's not in health care. Yeah, it's it's hard to see and imagine but [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4911.86s)]
*  I don't you know, I don't necessarily see [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4918.5s)]
*  My eyes or i'm looking at science and anatomy, you know, that's just a femur or that's just a brain [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4921.86s)]
*  This is parts of the anatomy that that you know, we've that we've you know studied and seen before [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4927.94s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not like i'm i'm seeing you, you know, i'm not seeing theo i'm seeing right, you know [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4933.62s)]
*  I just in general brain and [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4939.3s)]
*  Knees and whatever. Yeah, I mean people say how can you be a coroner because you see bad stuff [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4941.78s)]
*  Well an orthopedic surgeon [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4946.0199999999995s)]
*  Will take your arm off and they're dealing with blood and you know [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4948.18s)]
*  All kinds of things and they remove your arm and then put it back on, you know, so it's the same thing [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4952.1s)]
*  uh kinda [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4957.38s)]
*  It's just what we see [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4960.42s)]
*  Do you ever feel like so you determine the time of death? Yes [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4962.099999999999s)]
*  Wow, and how do you know if you get it right or whatever like does it buzz or go off or something? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4965.94s)]
*  Like how do you [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4969.62s)]
*  That's actually tricky, you know to the exact time of death. Okay [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4970.9s)]
*  There are things that can be done. You can do a [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4976.099999999999s)]
*  liver temperature [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4979.7s)]
*  um [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4981.3s)]
*  You can you know the the stage of decomposure if there are maggots and bugs on the body that can give you a window of how [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4982.42s)]
*  Long they've been down [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4989.46s)]
*  You know flies lay eggs and then you can even take the maggots and send them to a lab and they can tell you [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4990.9800000000005s)]
*  What their age is and that can help you determine time of death, but that's that's a bit extreme [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=4996.66s)]
*  We can there's other ways, you know, when was the last time you spoke to [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5001.9400000000005s)]
*  To so to to johnny, you know, when was the last time anybody saw him? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5005.46s)]
*  Um, what were his complaints when you saw him? When was his last facebook post? When was his last phone call? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5010.58s)]
*  So you can kind of get a window into that time of death even rigor mortis, you know [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5017.379999999999s)]
*  It comes on and then it lets go and there are certain time amounts on that so we can figure out [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5021.86s)]
*  You know an approximate time of death, you know [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5026.98s)]
*  Unless you're working in the eor and they stop breathing or the paramedics are there because maybe they're sluggish, but they're not completely deceased [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5029.86s)]
*  Um, you know, that's an exact time but other than that, it's a it's a it's a guess based on evidence [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5037.3s)]
*  Okay [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5044.34s)]
*  When they call us we issue a time of death. It's when they contact us so [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5045.78s)]
*  Uh, we get called on johnny by a nurse in the eor or a police officer and I immediately look at my watch and say [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5050.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay time of death is 10 15 [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5056.099999999999s)]
*  That's not the exact time they died, but that's when they notified us. So okay close enough. Yeah [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5058.74s)]
*  And if you get it right do you get you don't get like a notification on your phone like nobody no [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5063.14s)]
*  There's no reward or anything for getting it right. No, no, no [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5067.620000000001s)]
*  now it does help the attorneys and when there's lawsuits happening or [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5070.9800000000005s)]
*  You know [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5076.34s)]
*  They need to get as close to the time of death as they can for homicides because then it puts people in different places [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5076.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, where were you at 10 50? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5083.780000000001s)]
*  you know, um [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5086.18s)]
*  So it's that you know, that's why sometimes it's really important to know as close as you can get to that actual time of death [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5088.02s)]
*  And is there like a toe you guys do actually you always hear about toe tags, right? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5095.46s)]
*  People put a toe tag on a body. Is that true? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5098.9800000000005s)]
*  So we don't put it on the toe [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5101.3s)]
*  But you know labeling that body is very important [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5102.820000000001s)]
*  If i'm going to send you to autopsy, I don't want to mix you up with someone else or I don't want to send you [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5105.780000000001s)]
*  with nothing and then they [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5110.02s)]
*  I always type a report on my death everything I see I have to type and put into a report [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5112.34s)]
*  So when that pathologist is reading that report [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5118.18s)]
*  I'm painting a picture for him and that helps him in his in his autopsy [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5121.38s)]
*  In fact, I brought you one. I brought you a your own personal toe tag here. No, I hang that on the wall [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5125.3s)]
*  Uh gosh, this is uh, you can hang it on your toe if you want [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5132.580000000001s)]
*  But if I sitting I don't know if my mom would be happy if I accept this right now [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5135.860000000001s)]
*  Oh to be determined to be determined. Yeah. Yeah, you also put that under sex. Yeah. Well I have you I think I have you in nola [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5139.38s)]
*  That's good. Yeah, that's where I was born at. So yeah, I could see myself dying over there, bro [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5147.3s)]
*  That's a great conversation piece, you know, yeah it is actually that's not a bad dude. I thank you. Yeah, very sweet of you, bro [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5151.3s)]
*  Did you speaking of new orleans did during hurricane katrina? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5157.14s)]
*  Did they bring in a lot of corners to help out what happens when there's a natural disaster like that? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5159.54s)]
*  Yeah, we can you know, um, did you get called in? I didn't go to new orleans [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5164.18s)]
*  Actually, I volunteered for lafayette because there was a lot of not coroner but health care in general [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5168.82s)]
*  Oh, I see. So there's still yeah, there's a lot of other recurring deaths and even in the outlier areas [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5174.26s)]
*  Yeah, i'm just thinking of katrina because it was one of the more known hurricanes. I think what else was there ida? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5178.66s)]
*  I'm trying to think what else was over by you guys hurricanes. Yeah ida there was some in texas [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5183.62s)]
*  If there's a big natural disaster, is it like all hand we need all corners to this part of the country? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5188.34s)]
*  Does that ever happen? Um, well there we do have protocols, you know [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5192.9800000000005s)]
*  If a plane falls out the sky and there's you know, 100 people, uh, we do have protocols [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5196.5s)]
*  We can reserve a cooler truck. We can call walmart and say hey one of your big, you know freezer trucks [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5201.14s)]
*  Can we you know borrow one? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5206.02s)]
*  There's a whole team of people that were prepared for that mass shootings and whatnot. It's important to identify [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5208.42s)]
*  Who each person is? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5214.66s)]
*  Um, so we can contact their families and and and you know, um [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5216.5s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5221.46s)]
*  We had a um, you know, i've worked with the ntsb on an airplane [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5222.74s)]
*  We had a little little it wasn't a lot of bodies, but and what is ntsb? So that's the the the that's the [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5226.26s)]
*  When a plane goes down, it's the federal agency that investigates plane accidents [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5232.82s)]
*  Okay, and that one was unique because we had a little small sesna that fell out the sky [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5237.22s)]
*  And um, you know those guys come in and do their own autopsy and it's amazing from just wing damage of the plane [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5242.18s)]
*  They can tell you exactly where that plane was going in what direction to try to figure out what went wrong [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5248.42s)]
*  With that plane have you rolled up on a plane crash before so I was called to one. Yeah, and what was that that had to be? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5254.18s)]
*  From your own perspective probably interesting because that's not a common thing [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5260.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it was it was interesting to say the least it was you know two guys and it was actually a tough experience because [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5264.42s)]
*  Somebody was flying over [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5272.24s)]
*  In a in another plane and had taken a picture of that and posted it and then they took it down [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5274.639999999999s)]
*  So when something happens in a small town, everyone starts talking [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5280.16s)]
*  Hey, I heard there was a airplane accident or a motorcycle accident where everybody thinks of their loved ones [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5283.599999999999s)]
*  And in this case family was reaching out [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5288.96s)]
*  Yeah to the deceased and it's hard to watch that phone ring and just stare at it and know that you know [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5291.36s)]
*  This person, you know is trying to get a hold of their loved one that that can be tough [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5297.76s)]
*  um [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5303.4400000000005s)]
*  To see and you know, you just know that that mother or father is trying to get a hold of their son [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5304.72s)]
*  So that probably happens often then you're at a crash site and there's a ringing phone right or any yeah any site, you know [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5310.08s)]

*  You know people are trying to call him. I mean I lost my best friend and [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5323.280000000001s)]
*  We didn't have phones back then but trying to contact him [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5327.52s)]
*  So that's very common that phones will just ring and ring and you don't you don't want to make that notification over the phone [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5330.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't know you want to send an officer out there or sometimes we'll go with them [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5336.08s)]
*  But you will yeah, we we we don't have to but i've done several ride-alongs. It's not a not an easy thing to do [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5340.64s)]
*  You know when we when we go out to a scene we're often forgot and we're the the last responder right [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5350.08s)]
*  When we go out and and your loved one is deceased whether it's sudden or natural families are in a different mindset [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5355.44s)]
*  Uh, they you know rarely remember us, you know from that [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5362.48s)]
*  That case and I always give people my personal cell. It's like look you're gonna have questions later [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5366.64s)]
*  You know call me i'm gonna you know, i'll sit with your family and tell you exactly what went on [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5371.36s)]

*  Maybe you didn't look at this one right or not believe the cause of death and I can't share all that information [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5389.84s)]
*  You know, I can't share everything that I see and find [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5395.84s)]
*  Um with the public so i'm 100 right but some people maybe it's a suicide and they don't believe that this person would have [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5399.280000000001s)]
*  Done that and they're you know, did you did you investigate it for a homicide and it's like well believe you me [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5406.96s)]
*  That's the first thing I do [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5412.0s)]
*  You know, um, so we do get those calls from time to time [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5413.84s)]
*  um [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5418.08s)]
*  The hardest part and we were talking about suicides earlier, you know, the blood and guts don't bother me [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5419.44s)]
*  um [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5424.96s)]
*  But when for me anyway when I read a suicide note, that's what sticks with me. I can remember everyone I wrote I've read [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5426.4800000000005s)]
*  For some reason it's personal at that point not hey i'll be in the barn come find me in the barn [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5434.08s)]
*  You know, maybe a child emails their suicide report a note to their family. Can you imagine? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5439.04s)]
*  and [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5445.04s)]
*  And or just a long letter it it makes it more personal and that sticks with me longer than anything else [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5445.92s)]
*  And what is what are those entail a lot of times if you're looking through them notes, what are they putting in there? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5453.44s)]
*  Well, you know don't blame yourself kind of thing. Um, i'll always [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5459.36s)]
*  Be an an angel on your on your shoulder and just your real personal things, you know [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5463.28s)]
*  I didn't do this because of you or [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5468.639999999999s)]
*  You know, it's it's [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5470.96s)]
*  For some reason that sticks in my brain more than than than the actual scene [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5472.639999999999s)]
*  um [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5477.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's just hard to deal with sometimes, you know that that changes the the mood if you will [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5479.12s)]
*  Has there been a death that was really just blew your mind at how tough it was to deal with that's something that [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5484.08s)]
*  Maybe it attached to something you had personally in your life or an experience and learn about yourself [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5488.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's the that you know, those are when you'd ask me about personal ones. I guess when I see [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5493.68s)]
*  um, you know, I have children and when maybe like not that long ago, I had a [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5498.8s)]
*  22 year old loose his dad [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5505.04s)]
*  And to watch that 22 year old walk up to his father in an er, you know [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5507.4400000000005s)]
*  I could imagine my children coming to see me and and it you know, those hurt [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5512.56s)]
*  Same as with babies and you know, uh [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5517.68s)]
*  all those things are hard to see they really take a toll on us and [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5521.36s)]
*  You know, there is no out for us. We have to deal with it best we can [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5525.44s)]
*  They're not always easy, you know, my escape is music [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5530.72s)]
*  I listen to music on the way there and i'll listen to music on the way back [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5533.04s)]
*  And it's on the way home and it's two different types of music depending on what i've seen but we all need that escape [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5536.88s)]
*  Um, yeah, like what will you put on like some creedence clear water or what will you like? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5543.52s)]

*  You know they back in the the early windows 98 when you could set your screensaver to to just roll through your pictures on your computers [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5622.5s)]
*  every once in a while one would get away from me and it would just be this really this gory picture and i'd have [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5629.46s)]
*  to take it down but [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5634.42s)]
*  You know i've [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5637.46s)]
*  You know, yeah, my kids are just desensitized to say the least but they hear me telling stories about what i'm working with [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5640.18s)]
*  Yeah, and so they know how dangerous drugs or they know [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5646.1s)]

*  Yeah, that's a great question [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5655.62s)]
*  Like if you were a parent if you were or just a human being, you know [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5656.66s)]
*  You mentioned earlier like the holidays is kind of a time where you need to be a little bit more [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5660.099999999999s)]
*  Cognizant because things happen then you know things happen fast [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5664.08s)]
*  Um, yeah not to take a two-lane highway if you can a four-lane [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5667.78s)]
*  It's so funny after living in a bigger city and you get back to a smaller place two-lane roads like highways [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5671.219999999999s)]
*  Seems so dangerous you're like [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5677.54s)]
*  It's crazy to think that both of us are gonna pass each other safely with all the common accoutrements they have people having cell phones whistles [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5679.94s)]
*  You know perversion toys or whatever and somebody two people are gonna go by each other 70 miles an hour [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5688.66s)]
*  Say yeah those people those people are on fentanyl and heroin coke and and and mushrooms and you name it [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5693.86s)]

*  Um, i've had even seasoned farmers will die on four-wheelers and it's kind of a thing kids love to ride four-wheelers [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5711.14s)]
*  And they're just so dangerous if they flip on you [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5718.42s)]
*  You're gonna break they're gonna break your neck. There's a great possibility of that the same with [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5720.98s)]
*  You hear of polaris rangers and and other utv's a four-wheel golf cart like four-wheel drive things [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5726.42s)]
*  People don't consider the flip ratios on those things and i've had, you know several cases where [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5733.0599999999995s)]
*  Three or four children die on them, you know, you may go to tractor supply and get a get a cheaper [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5739.62s)]
*  You know eight thousand dollars for a you know, four a four by four that you four wheels and people think well that's safer [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5744.18s)]
*  But the flip ratios are are terrible on those cheaper ones. Yeah, uh, and they flip when kids are just riding them in the yard [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5750.5s)]
*  You know, so that's my big thing is four-wheelers. I'm scared to death [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5757.7s)]

*  Then that's what it is. You know that that's some of the risk of things [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5780.66s)]
*  um [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=5784.02s)]

*  Beautiful animals, but i've seen people that they've just reacted and grabbed their neck and killed them [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6098.5s)]
*  You know those animals can be [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6105.3s)]
*  Great and they can be dangerous. You know, what about some unique animal deaths you ever rolled up because louisiana bro? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6108.5s)]
*  You know i'm saying anything [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6113.54s)]
*  People some people you know [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6115.46s)]
*  You know that other than you know having a good pet having a pit bull as a pet and biting the owner [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6117.86s)]
*  And getting them in the right spot, you know that no alligators. No alligators [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6124.34s)]
*  Not yet now now bodies that have been chewed on by turtles and possums and other animals when they're dumped into the water [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6128.58s)]
*  That's uh, that's hard. You know, that's tough [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6135.3s)]
*  But again, that's you know, not a whole lot of animal deaths now riding horses and not knowing how to ride like I mentioned [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6138.26s)]
*  Horses can really mess you up. You know if you don't know what you're doing. It's a big animal. Oh, yeah [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6145.62s)]
*  At martygar once I saw two horses making love when the cops were still on their back. Oh, wow [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6151.7s)]
*  Yeah, well we see that and that's you know, somebody joins the martygar ride with a horse that hasn't been fixed the stud [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6156.82s)]
*  And they'll climb the back, you know [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6164.5s)]
*  Yeah, and you know that's oh that's harrowing as a kid seeing your stepdad, you know [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6167.62s)]
*  Yeah getting overtaken by some animal. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's a that's a thing. Um [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6173.54s)]
*  Other crazy cases are uh anal insertions. It's like what people and what are people doing it for for pleasure [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6179.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay, you know [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6186.74s)]
*  We would see that a lot in the eor but I had a case where the guy obviously didn't want to go to the eor [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6187.86s)]
*  And so he had had a hammer and was using the backside of a hammer to put in his buttocks [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6193.459999999999s)]
*  Right, right and that can perforate your colon and then you get really septic. Yeah [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6197.94s)]
*  So, you know things like that. Um [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6202.66s)]
*  Damn, I was you know [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6205.78s)]
*  Another interesting case would be um huffing where people use keyboard cleaner to get high [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6208.5s)]
*  And those deaths occur in [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6214.82s)]
*  parking lots of stores [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6217.7s)]
*  Most frequently you're going to find a huffer in the parking lot at walmart. Oh because they get out and get right into that can [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6219.86s)]
*  and and [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6225.78s)]
*  That's why I had one guy [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6227.22s)]
*  Um actually a veteran [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6228.66s)]
*  And that's how he would stop his nightmares [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6230.74s)]
*  It was the only thing that worked and so law enforcement's on scene and they're like we can't find any drugs [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6232.58s)]
*  But there's air cans everywhere [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6237.14s)]
*  You know and that's dangerous the worst is when you think you're doing like huffing like one of those things and you actually get [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6239.0599999999995s)]
*  One of those horns. Yeah, I can imagine [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6244.18s)]
*  That's a wake-up call. Oh, yeah, dude. That's a death. That's the lord trying to say hey look boba time to stop [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6247.7s)]
*  Yeah, i'm gonna rescue you real quick daddy, you know, that's the worst man the uh [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6252.66s)]
*  The synthetic drugs that you see so go next time you're in a gas station just look around [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6257.459999999999s)]
*  You know, they sell kratom they sell [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6262.259999999999s)]
*  Uh, oh, yeah, what is that all sorts of stuff? My nephew is zaza. So zaza is scourge or something [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6264.259999999999s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6272.259999999999s)]
*  Look up gas station dope or whatever gas station heroin. Yeah [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6273.7s)]
*  He was on [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6278.179999999999s)]
*  So there's kratom and you know, there's um [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6280.339999999999s)]
*  The the worst one that i'm seeing now is well that that's still for sale is t-aneptine it's t-aneptine right? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6284.02s)]
*  That's that's zaza [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6291.62s)]
*  So what that is, it's an antidepressant. It's actually a tricyclic antidepressant that [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6294.02s)]
*  Tags to the mu receptor, which is your opioid receptor [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6300.1s)]
*  So supposedly if you take one it gives you that opioid feeling [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6303.14s)]
*  But you're taking an antidepressant on and off and in large amounts and that's very dangerous [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6307.3s)]
*  Yeah, and and once so I mean you can take [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6314.099999999999s)]
*  Commonly prescribed lexapro for a week or two and when you try to stop you start having these [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6317.46s)]
*  Uh, you start detoxing on this medication so people that get on that stuff can't come off [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6322.9s)]
*  It's actually when I was reading on it, it's worse than heroin the withdrawals from that stuff [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6328.18s)]
*  And speaking to gas station owners, they said people come in here every day [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6333.379999999999s)]
*  They scrounge up 30 bucks to buy a bottle of this stuff and they do it every day every day [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6337.219999999999s)]
*  And kids can buy this kind of stuff. They can go to a gas station and buy some bullshit [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6342.5s)]
*  You know that you don't really know what it is [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6347.0599999999995s)]
*  when when [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6349.78s)]
*  The the synthetic bath salts and the synthetic marijuana came around [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6351.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah at first it was a synthetic marijuana and we didn't really get any uh, there wasn't anything bad happening [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6356.0199999999995s)]
*  But then they outlawed it and then it came back and that's when it got really bad [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6362.740000000001s)]
*  That's when people and i'd never seen this but people were chewing other people's faces off and it it it [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6368.18s)]
*  Completely changes their their psychopathology. They just go crazy on it [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6375.6s)]
*  And these companies they keep making them illegal [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6381.3s)]
*  But they keep adding a different chemical to it so they can sell it again. And this was this was really [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6383.3s)]
*  We would you know, we bad batches there's never a good batch [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6389.38s)]
*  But we could tell when there were bad batches because of the psych units [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6392.18s)]
*  We would get a lot of people that needed help being committed to bad batches of these fake of these guys [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6396.0199999999995s)]
*  Like we eat over those fake. Yeah fake marijuana or bath salts and we'd get calls where [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6402.099999999999s)]
*  You know jimmy's in his underwear holding a crawfish talking to god in the middle of a street [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6407.0599999999995s)]
*  And he was on that stuff [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6411.62s)]
*  I had one guy that was doing 60 miles an hour and jumped out his truck while driving [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6412.74s)]
*  Oh, and that's what he was on [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6417.3s)]

*  um [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6427.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's dark the things that can happen man. And so um, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6428.58s)]
*  Is there moments where like so say if you are because you're kind of like you determine if people are dead or not, right? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6432.1s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah, they're dead. I mean, yeah, have you ever had somebody and they're not dead? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6439.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's well in that one regard where they still had a heartbeat but okay, but yeah, no [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6444.259999999999s)]
*  It's never a are they dead? I mean even the law enforcement and people can tell [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6448.42s)]
*  You know when someone's not breathing you never showed up and be like this guy ain't this guy ain't dead. No, okay [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6453.3s)]

*  But there was a little party like a because we all have kind of twisted parts of our souls [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6469.86s)]
*  That felt a little bit of joy you think no [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6474.259999999999s)]
*  No, I uh [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6476.98s)]

*  Maybe one day but yeah because i'm i'm thinking of myself as a loving person [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6494.259999999999s)]
*  But I can't you know, we all have we're all very complex individuals and and uncomplex [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6497.7s)]

*  Do you get invited to a lot of the services and stuff? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6525.54s)]
*  Do you have to go to that thing or are you guys required to go to the funeral? No only no [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6527.46s)]
*  Not really only for friends. Um [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6530.9800000000005s)]
*  Really friends and and and maybe there's a few cases that were just really hard where the family was struggling and i'll go in there [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6534.26s)]
*  And give them a hug [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6540.740000000001s)]
*  Um, you know covid was a thing and uh covid was was really rough. Really? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6542.26s)]
*  my opinion on covid [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6548.02s)]
*  From what I dealt with [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6550.1s)]
*  When it started, you know, we like I said death is seasonal [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6552.18s)]
*  and [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6556.900000000001s)]
*  March april may it eases up. That's our slow time. Uh, we don't get as many deaths now [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6559.06s)]
*  You know ods and suicides and homicides [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6566.820000000001s)]
*  Or 24 7 now, I mean that happens every day [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6570.5s)]
*  but [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6573.46s)]
*  the the the end of spring early summer is when we don't get as many calls and I can remember training somebody and she would say [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6574.26s)]
*  When am I going to get something good? When am I going to get something good? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6581.7s)]
*  And I kept saying just be patient just be patient, you know, it's like bass fishing [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6584.1s)]
*  You might have just some normal everyday stuff and then boom you get a big one. Yeah [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6587.86s)]
*  Well, I used to work fast food too and I remember [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6591.94s)]
*  Everybody wants to do the fries or something like the first day you're there, you know, it's like dude. You can't just do that [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6594.74s)]
*  covid came [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6600.66s)]
*  and [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6602.34s)]
*  You know, we had heard rumors that there was this virus and we'd went my wife and I went to colorado and [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6603.3s)]
*  We were aware but it it wasn't out the box yet. And then shortly after we got home [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6610.1s)]
*  We just started getting phone calls and phone calls and phone calls. I mean, I still have ptsd from talking on the phone [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6616.74s)]
*  You know in health care. We didn't know what was going on. People were dying [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6623.78s)]
*  Left and right i'm talking I would have one hospital on the phone and i'd have to say can you please hold and I would answer [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6628.34s)]
*  The other one i'd have three calls coming in every hour [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6634.1s)]
*  And that stayed constant for [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6638.1s)]
*  You know three or four months [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6640.98s)]
*  Just the amount of deaths we had now, louisiana [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6643.3s)]
*  We have a lot of unhealthy people. Oh, yeah in general [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6646.26s)]
*  and when you know covid was the same same thing every time it was [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6649.3s)]
*  Before the nurse would tell me i'm like, well wait, let me guess the patient came into the eor wasn't breathing [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6654.66s)]
*  You'll put them on a cpap [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6659.86s)]
*  Y'all ventilated them a while. They failed that y'all put them on a ventilator in the family with drew care. Am I right? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6662.26s)]
*  And they were like, yep, you got it. It was the same [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6666.98s)]
*  Manner of death every time and it was rampant [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6670.0199999999995s)]
*  We didn't stop now. Some people say I don't believe covid and you're you're pronouncing these people and blaming it on covid [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6674.5s)]
*  Sure, they had diabetes. They they were obese. They had [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6682.0199999999995s)]
*  All kinds of problems, but the volume of deaths that took off at that time [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6685.379999999999s)]
*  Was unbelievable and it was a lot of my it made it awkward for my a lot of people I know my friends [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6691.7s)]
*  I've lost i've lost friends to that [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6697.62s)]
*  Friends parents, you know, it was just it made it awkward [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6700.339999999999s)]
*  I'd go hang out with my buddy and he knows, you know [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6703.379999999999s)]
*  He knew that I pronounced his father and there was a lot of that going on during covid [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6705.86s)]
*  People ever get mad at you for pronouncing their family deceased. No, no, no, but it just kind of makes it [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6710.98s)]
*  Blame it on you. Huh? No, it but it it does it made it awkward [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6716.0199999999995s)]
*  You know and so when you look back at that time, right because there's tons of things being said about covid right, right [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6720.26s)]
*  especially, you know things like um [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6725.54s)]
*  Oh, it's not real right, right, so you would dispute that totally. Absolutely. There's no doubt something came along [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6728.5s)]
*  Yeah, i've been up for four days answering the phone. I mean I went through [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6733.86s)]
*  I saved them. I went through [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6738.42s)]
*  Five five subject notebooks in a month, you know [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6740.9s)]
*  It was it was overwhelming [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6745.78s)]
*  Did you think that the [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6748.34s)]
*  Like the manner of like treatment like because a lot then there was a lot of rumors like oh people put people on ventilators [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6751.139999999999s)]
*  They shouldn't have that's what killed them. Do you think that there could have been some [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6756.74s)]
*  And we don't know, you know, I don't know a lot of this stuff, right? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6760.58s)]
*  You may have more insight than I do [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6763.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you think that as people as the medical profession was figuring out how to best handle people that they [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6764.66s)]
*  That that could have contributed to more deaths. I think we found better ways to treat them and make them manageable [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6771.0599999999995s)]
*  You know steroids were the first thing that popped into all of our heads because they couldn't breathe [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6777.46s)]
*  We need to shrink that soft tissue and give them steroids later. They said, you know laying prone or on your stomach made it easier to breathe [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6781.38s)]
*  Ventilators at coming from respiratory therapy when the lungs get stiff you have to go to a pressure ventilation [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6789.84s)]
*  And it's actually called aards a rds [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6796.9s)]
*  And it's a it's a acute respiratory [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6800.34s)]
*  Failure in adults where their lungs actually become stiff. So when we're ventilating someone we're using a volume based [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6802.5s)]
*  uh air to open and close their lungs, but when they had covid their lungs would stiffen up and the only way to [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6810.42s)]
*  To truly ventilate them to get their co2 down was to jack up that vent on pressure support [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6817.86s)]
*  On a pressure ventilation that is you're sending in a pretty uh, what a pretty high psi you mean? Yeah [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6824.74s)]
*  We yeah, we we were ventilating them with air pressure [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6831.219999999999s)]
*  Instead of just that volume flow based and we had to that was the only way you could get their lungs to open and close [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6834.98s)]
*  And then eventually they wouldn't they would stiffen up [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6840.58s)]
*  so when people were saying covid's not real and you know, it was [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6842.98s)]
*  You know, I knew [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6847.0599999999995s)]
*  The treatment and I knew what was going on and we've never had a stretch where everybody needed pressure ventilation [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6849.0599999999995s)]
*  Right was like what is going on with this and that's what happened with everybody. We just couldn't ventilate them [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6855.54s)]
*  Sure diabetes played a factor sure [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6860.66s)]
*  Congestive heart failure played a factor, you know, we didn't get many young healthy people that died of covid. Yeah, but [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6863.12s)]
*  The the the rate and the amount was overwhelming. So I knew it was real and it was scary. Yeah, you got to understand that [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6871.38s)]
*  Again, I told you I had a can of off and a badge [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6879.06s)]

*  And you know when you find a large amount of money on a scene and you're in that moment [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6909.46s)]
*  And you you open a duffel bag and there's you know [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6914.099999999999s)]

*  Offshore or something and you know when we're trying to figure out why this 50 year old guy or 40 year old guy is dead [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6935.94s)]
*  opened his bag and [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6942.74s)]
*  You know, sometimes we'll find drugs and other things but in his bag he had some true 3m [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6945.3s)]
*  Masks and I can remember that and we were all just [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6951.46s)]
*  Salivating over it like wow, you know, he'd probably taken them from offshore [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6955.92s)]
*  But we didn't even have wow that protective gear and just to see him with a case of those it would be like man [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6959.9400000000005s)]
*  I would love a box of those right about now [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6966.26s)]
*  We were scary, you know, because we didn't know what covet was and what it could cause and family and children and getting home [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6968.42s)]
*  I'd sit outside every night and [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6973.9400000000005s)]
*  Watch tv and stay away from my family because we were so exposed to that, you know [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6976.42s)]
*  Vaccinations that's a whole nother story. But you know the I took one because I was just seeing too many deaths [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6982.32s)]
*  Um, yeah, I can imagine from your perspective that that had to be crazy. Yeah, it was like here's this new thing [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6988.9s)]
*  We don't know what's going on [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6993.54s)]
*  a lot of people are saying that it doesn't exist a lot of people are saying that it's [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6994.82s)]
*  You know that it's man-made a lot of people are saying these things that like whatever methods we're using to [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=6999.14s)]
*  Treat people or what's killing them, you know [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7005.06s)]
*  Yeah, there were people on social media friends of ours that were going out of their way to tell people that it was all a [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7009.54s)]
*  Bunch of bullshit then, you know, don't wear a mask and don't do this and and here i'm sitting with [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7015.54s)]
*  Compositions in every part of the house with deaths and i'm thinking why are you going out your way? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7022.4s)]
*  To tell people this isn't real or it's a political hoax or what? You know [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7028.5s)]
*  Just it was tough. Yeah, well I can certainly from here come follow me around and let me show you how real this is [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7032.66s)]
*  You know it was it was uh [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7039.7s)]
*  People had their own opinions about it. So I I never got involved into the you know, who said or why it's here [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7042.1s)]
*  Yeah, I just well I think at first I didn't know if it was real. I don't know [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7048.02s)]
*  I've always been super untrustworthy of a lot of stuff. So [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7051.14s)]
*  but um [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7054.18s)]
*  But also I never got different people's experiences are different too. Some people never got sick [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7056.1s)]
*  So they never had any you know, and then they never knew anybody that got sick, right? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7061.14s)]
*  So then to some people it's like what is even going on, you know, and that's their reality, you know [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7066.1s)]
*  Um, so and you can't blame them, right? Yeah, that's what i'm saying. You can't blame some people you can't blame their reality. I think some [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7071.54s)]
*  Because that's their truth that how could they know anything else? Right, but then I think there was a lot of uncertainty [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7079.06s)]
*  Um, and also just people not trusting the news anymore. There used to be a time where you trusted the news, right? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7085.240000000001s)]
*  You felt like it was genuine it at least had some [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7091.320000000001s)]
*  Similance of the best interest for humanity and that was kind of eroding right then right [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7094.120000000001s)]
*  So I think at that point when both those things happened at the same time [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7098.6s)]
*  You know a lot of conspiracy theories are [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7102.04s)]
*  Or sometimes what can later be seen as truthful, you know a lot of stuff that was conspiracy then now people are saying [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7104.68s)]
*  It was correct so it's just you know, a lot of that's kind of um, absolutely and there were there were there were alternate [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7110.599999999999s)]
*  Ways to treat yourself joe rogan was you know [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7116.679999999999s)]
*  right about some of the medications and therapies he encouraged as well as [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7120.04s)]
*  Uh talking about obese versus healthy people and all that was spot on. Yeah, you know, um [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7124.04s)]
*  But it was tough to witness and see and pronounce a lot of friends and I knew it was real [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7130.5199999999995s)]
*  Right, especially right where you are. I mean you standing right there at the finish line, dude [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7135.639999999999s)]
*  Absolutely [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7140.1s)]
*  Do you ever feel like you were like [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7141.4800000000005s)]
*  When people died is it feel like they're going somewhere else. Do you feel like [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7144.44s)]
*  Do you think like all right this person's going to heaven or this person's going to hell or do you ever have any little thoughts [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7149.64s)]
*  like that or [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7155.4s)]
*  Um, yeah, I have opinions, you know on some people that I know that I might know but me too. I'm saying nothing but me too [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7157.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7164.04s)]
*  um [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7164.92s)]
*  No, my you know [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7165.88s)]
*  You know, they're in a better place [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7168.12s)]
*  I often think you know, god it's going to be hard to to lose my father or or my wife [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7170.84s)]
*  And then I I witnessed my father-in-law die of cancer and he was struggling there at the end [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7177.56s)]
*  And uh to know that he was no longer struggling and when he finally passed it was there was a peace [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7183.08s)]
*  You know, so I I think you can I can accept that in some regards later in life because you know you see [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7188.4400000000005s)]
*  you see the the the [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7195.4800000000005s)]
*  Really bad deaths and you see people that struggle and sometimes it's you know, i'm glad they were god took them [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7197.48s)]
*  You know away from this pain and suffering. So yeah [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7204.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, do you feel like um, do you ever feel like people are going like do you get any insight? [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7208.679999999999s)]
*  I guess into just being around death so much right? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7214.28s)]
*  Because a lot of us aren't around it, right? We can't even go, you know [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7217.959999999999s)]
*  We people want to find a dead body they can't you know people are but you get to be around it kind of [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7221.08s)]
*  do you ever feel like [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7227.719999999999s)]
*  That people are like do you ever get any insight if people are leaving to a better place or if they're [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7230.28s)]
*  Like do you feel anything like that? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7236.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you think you get any more insight than just the regular person sitting around wondering what the afterlife is like or anything? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7238.12s)]
*  No [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7244.28s)]
*  um [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7245.16s)]
*  but in those instances i'm i'm so [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7246.12s)]
*  Overwhelmed with evidence and looking at things that i'm not really [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7249.78s)]
*  Again when I see someone that was suffering or maybe they're 80 pounds and they were once 200 pounds i'm [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7253.879999999999s)]
*  i'm, you know somewhat relieved that they're gone, but um as far as for [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7259.4s)]
*  The afterlife, I you know, I know in my faith [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7264.5199999999995s)]
*  That you know, they're they're going to a better place [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7267.639999999999s)]
*  so [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7270.92s)]
*  But I have you know back to your question I've I've you know, I guess i've joked and said well this guy's going straight to hell [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7273.879999999999s)]
*  You know, uh, yeah, sometimes you gotta but yeah [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7278.92s)]
*  He's going straight down. Yeah, but um again, that's just personal joking [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7282.68s)]
*  Stuff like that. Yeah [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7287.8s)]
*  um [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7290.360000000001s)]
*  you know, um [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7291.320000000001s)]
*  So crystal meth came and [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7293.400000000001s)]
*  That drug is is really rough on people it turns people into monsters. Really? It really does these people [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7296.120000000001s)]
*  I mean they just turn into demons. They do things that most normal people wouldn't do [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7303.320000000001s)]
*  But it's interesting when I have someone that abuses meth and I go into their home [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7308.120000000001s)]
*  Because these people are up all night fidgeting. They can't sit still right? Yeah, they do electrical. Yeah [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7313.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they do electrical sometimes they want to i've had people take electrical wires and try to create things and they shock themselves [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7317.72s)]
*  Um, but what's interesting sometimes is the things they make like drone deflectors [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7325.080000000001s)]
*  I went into a house once and they had all these weird things hanging and I actually went home and built one just [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7329.8s)]
*  as a memorabilia, but [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7335.240000000001s)]
*  you'll take they'll take a [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7337.8s)]
*  electrical cord or rope and then they'll they'll [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7339.860000000001s)]
*  Sew or wrap a barbecue spatula on the end of it. It makes no sense [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7343.400000000001s)]
*  But they would put them in all the corners of their houses and i'd ask families like hey, what's that? [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7348.360000000001s)]
*  What's going on with all this and dream catcher to arby's? Yeah. Yeah, and it's like hey that's drone [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7352.68s)]

*  You know, so it's kind of kind of cool like oh man, you know the paranoia would set in and [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7360.120000000001s)]
*  It's interesting, you know, it's sad and it's terrible and [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7366.12s)]
*  All of the above but it was interesting to see some of that. It is some of the creativity [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7370.04s)]
*  There's a lot of like odd creativity in myth [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7373.96s)]
*  You know, you can tell when you go into a house when there's calculators taken apart and just things that you know [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7376.36s)]

*  As we work we get faster at things we do, you know, we learn how to do them faster [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7485.400000000001s)]
*  and uh [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7489.72s)]

*  In the situation because yeah, the only opposite to such a dark moment is some levity, you know [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7533.4s)]
*  We'll tease the officers joke around with the officers on scene not so much the person playing there but um, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7541.16s)]
*  You try to pick up their spirits [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7548.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, um [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7551.48s)]
*  In all sorts of ways, you know [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7553.4s)]
*  Sometimes you can ask them to to hold something and they think they're actually doing something that needs to be done [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7555.96s)]
*  And they're just holding a needle. Yeah, you know an hour later. They're still standing there holding that needle [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7561.0s)]
*  It's like you can let that go now, you know [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7565.64s)]
*  But yeah, we you know, you you have to have a a bit of humor [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7569.4s)]

*  But when we get called out to a homicide [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7603.080000000001s)]
*  A shooting, you know in one of the cities close to us. They're rated the number one [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7606.52s)]

*  It was a block away, but you know when you're in scrubs and shots are fired, you know, it's pretty tough [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7657.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, um, yeah because somebody's already dead [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7663.080000000001s)]

*  Yeah, well there was a case in north louisiana where the guy had uh [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7668.92s)]
*  Was shot and the paramedics were working on him a friend of mine was actually on on this scene [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7673.08s)]
*  And so they're working on him and a guy walks up [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7677.8s)]
*  And says uh, hey man, is he gonna make it? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7681.0s)]

*  Puts three more rounds in him [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7688.4400000000005s)]
*  You know so scene control can be tough when there's you know, two officers and 300 people [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7690.4400000000005s)]

*  The whole crowd was telling him about time when he all died [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7717.8s)]
*  You know and and just saying things that you know, y'all all need to die and you know, you have guns [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7721.32s)]
*  But we have bigger guns [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7725.8s)]
*  When you buy yourself [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7727.8s)]
*  You know at 10 o'clock at night with 300 people [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7729.64s)]

*  They don't they don't at all. They really don't nobody would and a lot of these young officers haven't been through health care [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7740.76s)]
*  And they see things that I see [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7746.28s)]
*  We see them more frequently but still those young officers that are 22 23 [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7748.360000000001s)]
*  They're looking at things that they've never seen before, you know [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7753.08s)]
*  And like you mean victims and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah, just well every death that I see, you know [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7756.84s)]

*  I have a [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7770.84s)]
*  Partners in a company where we do psychological evaluations for law enforcement. Oh, that's wonderful [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7772.2s)]
*  Yeah, so we have a team of psychologists that review they take them through different tests and instruments [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7777.0s)]
*  And determine if they're suitable for law enforcement [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7783.24s)]
*  And right now the only people that are that are applying for law enforcement are high risk [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7786.6s)]
*  And that's what makes it tough for [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7791.64s)]
*  City police, you know, you got to hire somebody who was shoplifting two months ago, right? [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7794.28s)]

*  Very you know, and then it's like if you want to move away from places like that people say [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=7841.96s)]

*  You know my kids even when they were they were scared of them [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8590.1s)]
*  But I had a crazy aunt who had mannequins as company and she was living in new york covington [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8592.820000000002s)]
*  If not, if i'm not mistaken and when we moved her back [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8597.78s)]
*  She had all these mannequins and I was a young kid and every time we would go to her retirement home [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8600.9s)]
*  They were in different positions wearing different clothes and that was her company. She was really had some psych issues. Yeah, so [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8605.3s)]
*  When we had kids i'm like, you know what? I need to carry that family tradition. We need a mannequin in here [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8612.42s)]
*  So, uh, we had one we took it to on orcansall vacation with us and the the camp next to us [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8617.06s)]
*  Just wasn't quite sure about us. Yeah, because I pointed face in their cabin, right? [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8622.9s)]
*  And then uh, I found a willie nelson mannequin in a place that the guy sold it to me and [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8627.06s)]
*  It's just a lot of fun. It's pretty cool. It's weird. Yeah, it's cool [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8633.86s)]
*  Uh, we took him to new orleans in a wheelchair and pushed him around but most people didn't even notice him, you know [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8637.06s)]
*  Yeah, but I would set him somewhere and just watch people walk by and say, excuse me, you know [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8641.78s)]
*  So, uh, yeah, we're different people. We you know [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8646.34s)]
*  But well, yeah if you play in a man if you're taking mannequins running wheelchairs, I think that that is a [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8649.54s)]
*  I understand. I think it all makes perfect sense now, but yeah, I think you gotta have some fun [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8654.98s)]
*  Louisiana's always been like that. Absolutely people always having fun. My mother loved willie nelson [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8659.22s)]
*  um [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8664.58s)]

*  They was making processes over at this joint and they'd throw a lot of them out the ones that didn't come out good [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8668.34s)]
*  Oh, wow, so we're always beating the shit out of each other with fucking [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8673.06s)]

*  I think it's it's not a place where there's a lot going on [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8688.18s)]
*  You know, there's not a lot of big businesses [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8690.98s)]
*  I don't think there's any fortune 500 companies in louisiana except maybe entergy and I feel like they probably I think that they moved out [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8692.58s)]
*  But so it's a lot. It's just about people when having fun. Yeah, that's louisiana. Have a good time [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mChobj2i0M&t=8699.3s)]
