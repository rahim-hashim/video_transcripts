*  I don't want him to just fall out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=238.0s)]
*  Just go AWOL. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=240.0s)]

*  I'm very thirsty for the woods. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah, fucking I'll take a shit anywhere. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=267.0s)]
*  I think in the future of people, shitting will be a thing of the past. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=269.0s)]
*  Actually defecating as a human. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=272.0s)]
*  Like if you see somebody go in a room by themselves to have... [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=274.0s)]
*  Desecration or whatever it's called. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=278.0s)]
*  Desecration. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=280.0s)]
*  Leave their body. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=281.0s)]
*  Defecation, isn't it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=282.0s)]
*  Defecation, yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=283.0s)]
*  Yeah, desecration I think is when you put your turtleneck on backwards. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=284.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what it is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=290.0s)]
*  But damn, dog. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=292.0s)]
*  No, the future is going to be like eye toilets or something. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=296.0s)]
*  Or it's like Apple will drop like some new thing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what's going to happen in the future. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=302.0s)]
*  It's exciting to think about. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=304.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah, I hope Apple is listening. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=307.0s)]
*  If Steve Jobs' ghost is here, we got to get out of fucking Ouija board. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=309.0s)]
*  Wake that motherfucker up, dude. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=313.0s)]
*  Where's your eye toilet, you fucking dead guy? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=315.0s)]
*  You just press a button and the meal leaves your stomach. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah, you put your phone, like just put it right against your stomach and it just fucking absorbs it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=321.0s)]
*  And then it sends it right to Brendan Schaub's mouth. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=326.0s)]
*  It just appears. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=330.0s)]
*  Brendan Schaub will be like, eating at some fucking stupid restaurant. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=331.0s)]
*  And then just shit just fills his mouth like a fucking Italian chipmunk just harboring nuts for the letter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=336.0s)]
*  Oh, and he gets back in his leopard skin, me out of it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=345.0s)]
*  He bought for eight million dollars because he didn't doesn't know how to buy things. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=349.0s)]
*  You want your child when you every time you floor it in there, you can hear endangered species die. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=353.0s)]
*  You can hear many special animals kill themselves. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it runs on Ebola. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=364.0s)]
*  Ebola auto. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=369.0s)]
*  That's the new fucking car Brendan drives. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=370.0s)]
*  No, but I think in the future, everyone will wear like a colostomy bag. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=372.0s)]
*  It was empty. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=376.0s)]
*  I think actually having to go to a room to like because it's crazy when you think about it, I'm going to go off to a private room and get like liquids or solids out of my body. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=377.0s)]
*  It almost seems like you're like a bad magician. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=387.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=390.0s)]
*  But it's a trick that everybody knows and the trick smells. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=392.0s)]
*  Yeah, like if you pull a rabbit out of a hat, doesn't smell unless the rabbit's dead. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=396.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's true. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=401.0s)]
*  Would that make sense? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=404.0s)]
*  Bad magic and it's just some guys pulling dead rabbits out of a hat. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=406.0s)]
*  How is that not a show? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=410.0s)]
*  There's every other fucking show on the air. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=412.0s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=414.0s)]
*  I was like quarantining and shit back in the day. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=416.0s)]
*  I can't even say that, which is weird. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=419.0s)]
*  So yeah, you left out of Columbus and what? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=420.0s)]
*  I left out of Columbus and I didn't know what was happening like everybody else. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=422.0s)]
*  I was like, what is happening? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=425.0s)]
*  And, you know, people were just it was up in the air. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=427.0s)]
*  And then I went and just they're like, you got to quarantine. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=430.0s)]
*  So I came back to L.A. and got my shit. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=435.0s)]
*  And then I went back to Minnesota where I'm from and quarantined in my sister's basement, which is a house that I bought her. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=436.0s)]
*  So your basement? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=445.0s)]
*  My basement. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=447.0s)]
*  She I remind her of that every time I step foot in that fucking place. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=448.0s)]
*  Anyway, I'll digress on that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=451.0s)]
*  But it was just weird because then it was like there were murder hornets and like all this weird shit kept dropping. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=454.0s)]
*  And then I love that the Pentagon revealed that they're aliens. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=461.0s)]
*  They're like, no, there's proof there's aliens. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=465.0s)]
*  People are like, yeah, yeah, cool. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=467.0s)]
*  Anyway, what's going on with this disease? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=468.0s)]
*  Like nobody cared about anything. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=470.0s)]
*  Yeah, they drop murder hornets on us. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=472.0s)]
*  I don't even know what the fuck that is. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=474.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like they kind of like it was a time where like they're going to slip other things out while people are. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=475.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=480.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, they're looking that way. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=481.0s)]
*  There's a lot of like distraction going on. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=483.0s)]
*  Well, that comes to my point. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=486.0s)]
*  So I was in quarantine and I got a Minnesota. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=488.0s)]
*  And what are you doing there? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=492.0s)]
*  You working during the day? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=493.0s)]
*  Are you doing anything? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=494.0s)]
*  Are you doing email? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=495.0s)]
*  I use my fucking mind. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=496.0s)]
*  OK, so I just sat there and I read books and I caught up on Netflix shows and I journaled. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=497.0s)]
*  And I caught up with a lot of friends and I did some podcasts and shit or like phone owners and stuff. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=504.0s)]
*  But I just sat there and like really thought about my life and you know what I wanted to accomplish in my next chapter. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=509.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=517.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I didn't drink or anything. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=518.0s)]
*  I was fucking sober. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=519.0s)]

*  Wow. Yeah, I didn't fucking. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=521.0s)]
*  You were living clean out there. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=523.0s)]
*  Now, were you doing a gym? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=524.0s)]
*  Were you elliptical or anything? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=525.0s)]
*  No, I just did push ups. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=527.0s)]
*  It was like a kind of it was like a prison. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=528.0s)]
*  It's not like you're incarcerated. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=531.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a prison with Netflix. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=532.0s)]
*  Your sister's upstairs. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=533.0s)]
*  She's upstairs and my nieces and nephews and stuff. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=535.0s)]
*  And I was like, just don't even don't come in this sanctuary. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=538.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I took shots. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=543.0s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=544.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=545.0s)]
*  And the dog would run in and he would watch me poop and then he would be like, all right, this is like the third time in like half hour. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=546.0s)]
*  He's like rerun. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=554.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=555.0s)]
*  And so then I got a message from Expedia and they were like, are you ready for your trip to Key West? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=557.0s)]
*  I had fucking forgot that I booked a trip to Key West that December before Covid or anything. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=564.0s)]
*  I was like, I've always wanted to go to Key West. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=570.0s)]

*  So I went to Key West, Florida. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=577.0s)]
*  I left there and then I went to South Carolina and hung out with Danny McBride for like a week. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=579.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=583.0s)]

*  He's like, you got to move here, dude. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=586.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I almost did. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=588.0s)]
*  But I went down to Key West and I was going to go back up to South Carolina. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=589.0s)]
*  But I stayed in Key West. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=594.0s)]
*  I was supposed to be there for 10 days. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=595.0s)]
*  I stayed for a year and a half in fucking Key West. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=597.0s)]
*  I was there a year and a half. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=601.0s)]
*  That's not a joke. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=603.0s)]
*  And what did you start like a not a farm, but you do like a job or something that you know, hired anywhere. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=604.0s)]
*  No. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=610.0s)]

*  So I just stayed down there and it was so removed from everything. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=618.0s)]
*  Like nobody gave a fuck. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=622.0s)]
*  I had no idea what day it was after a while when I just stayed. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=624.0s)]
*  I just kicked it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=627.0s)]

*  Sailing takes me away and suck my own dick. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=642.0s)]
*  But no, but it was awesome though. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=648.0s)]
*  Like nobody was on Twitter. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=651.0s)]
*  Nobody was like, yeah, everybody was just like Island Life and I just fell in love with it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=652.0s)]

*  Like after a year I didn't even own clothes. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=679.0s)]
*  I just wore like butterflies. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=682.0s)]
*  Is there government down there? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=684.0s)]
*  I feel like it's just like basically people down there just like obviously these people hate Native Americans and everybody because they're trying to get out of America. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=685.0s)]

*  You know, it's a lot of people driving from Florida and is a lot of fishing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=704.0s)]
*  There's a lot of fishing and there's a lot of like snowbirds. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=708.0s)]
*  But it's funny because when I landed, my buddy picked me up and he goes, welcome to the island of misfit toys. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=711.0s)]

*  And I didn't know what that meant. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=721.0s)]
*  And then after a little bit, I was like, oh, yeah, like everybody's just going right. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=722.0s)]
*  Like everyone's got a story. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=726.0s)]

*  Yeah, I was flying over Key West and then I decided, fuck, I'm just going to parachute out of this shit and just open the door. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=743.0s)]
*  But it was awesome. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=750.0s)]

*  Isn't that unbelievable? The way that they're starting to want to just get a cat. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2136.0s)]
*  They don't want that. They have to have an armadillo. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2142.0s)]
*  Fucking idiots. What are these people? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2145.0s)]
*  I don't know. Rich people, probably people making your movie. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2148.0s)]
*  Probably a fucking kennel of fucking Dillo's. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2151.0s)]

*  Who's more fun to work with? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2175.0s)]
*  Jennifer Aniston or David Spade? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2177.0s)]
*  To me, they're kind of both equal on the looks. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2181.0s)]
*  Both pretty good looking. Yeah. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2184.0s)]
*  Anderson seems sneaky, funny, though. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2186.0s)]
*  Spade's obvious funny. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2188.0s)]
*  OK, that's depending on the mood you're in. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2191.0s)]
*  But there we go. That's good. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2194.0s)]
*  Swartie. Thanks, dude. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2195.0s)]
*  I love that you call me Swartie. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2197.0s)]
*  That's my nickname. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2199.0s)]
*  Dude, I love that guy. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2200.0s)]
*  A looks like me if I were a little handsomer. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2202.0s)]
*  Right. And that guy moved to Arizona. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2205.0s)]
*  Very. He's living kind of a geodirt existence kind of. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2209.0s)]
*  Did you catch that at all? Yeah, I caught a little bit of dirt there. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2213.0s)]
*  Moved to Arizona. He for sure has a. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2216.0s)]
*  Which is where Spade is from. He's got a Dillo necklace. Oh. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2219.0s)]
*  Spade and Anderson. Interesting question. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2222.0s)]
*  They're both very different. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2226.0s)]
*  You're accurate on Anderson being sneaky, funny. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2227.0s)]
*  She's very funny. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2230.0s)]
*  She's got better hair than David. Oh, yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2233.0s)]
*  And hers is very majestic. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2235.0s)]
*  David smells like Funyuns. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2239.0s)]
*  Yeah. But David is very funny. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2243.0s)]
*  Yeah. But I'm going to give Aniston the edge because you will. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2246.0s)]
*  When you're in a scene with Aniston, your eye to eye, when you look at David, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2250.0s)]
*  you've got to look down. And he's kind of like a lawn gnome. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2253.0s)]
*  Oh, he's got that downhill vibe. Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2256.0s)]
*  But in a nice way, like a nice, funny little lawn gnome. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2259.0s)]
*  What about were you down there when Norm passed away? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2263.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was awful. Norm was one of my best friends. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2267.0s)]
*  That was awful. Really? Yeah. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2271.0s)]
*  That was my buddy Todd calling. I woke up from a nap and I look at my phone. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2274.0s)]
*  It's my friend, Todd. I'm like, hey, what's up? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2277.0s)]
*  He goes, we're just taking a nap. And I go, yeah, what's up? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2280.0s)]
*  He goes, you haven't checked your phone, have you? And I go, no. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2284.0s)]
*  And he goes, Norm MacDonald died. And I go, what? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2288.0s)]
*  No. And he goes, yeah. And it was one of the few times in my life [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2292.0s)]
*  I just hung up the phone and immediately started sobbing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2296.0s)]
*  And I sobbed for like a half hour. I just completely lost it. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2300.0s)]
*  He was like really like one of my close friends and it was... [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2303.0s)]
*  Like cutting weight for a fight, huh? It was awful, dude. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2306.0s)]
*  It was just... And then I found out he had cancer for a long time. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2309.0s)]
*  Didn't tell anybody and it was hard. It's still really hard. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2312.0s)]
*  Everyone's pretty shook by it. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2315.0s)]
*  Do you remember the last time that you had seen him? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2317.0s)]
*  I hadn't seen him for a while. But the last time I saw him [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2320.0s)]
*  was at a bar by our place. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2324.0s)]
*  And he would watch. He was a big gambler. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2327.0s)]
*  But the last time I talked to him, when I was quarantined in Minnesota, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2330.0s)]
*  I'd text him and I'd go, hey, what's up, dude? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2336.0s)]
*  And he goes, what? Who's this? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2340.0s)]
*  And he would do this all the time. I go, it's fucking Nick, dude. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2343.0s)]
*  He goes, hey, Nicky! What are you doing? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2347.0s)]
*  And I'm like, nothing. I'm quarantined. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2352.0s)]
*  And he goes, you didn't stand up? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2354.0s)]
*  And I'm like, no. What the fuck? No one's doing stand up. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2356.0s)]
*  And he goes, what's your plan? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2360.0s)]
*  And I go, I don't know. I'm going to kick it here. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2362.0s)]
*  And then I think I'm going to go to Key West. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2364.0s)]
*  And I go, I might just retire, though, and just move to Reno [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2366.0s)]
*  and just get like a residency. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2370.0s)]
*  And then I'll just live in Reno and just work there, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2372.0s)]
*  just be like an old comic. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2375.0s)]
*  And he goes, I swear to God, he goes, ah, that's a good idea. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2377.0s)]
*  And I go, yeah, I don't know. Whatever. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2382.0s)]
*  He goes, ah, maybe I'll join you. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2384.0s)]
*  We'll both headline Reno. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2387.0s)]
*  And I go, dude, Reno's fucking a mess. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2389.0s)]
*  I go, no, I don't want to do that. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2392.0s)]
*  So I go to Key West. A month later, he calls me and he goes, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2394.0s)]
*  hey, what are you doing? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2398.0s)]
*  And I go, I don't know. I'm in Key West. What's up with you? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2400.0s)]
*  And he goes, when are you going to Reno? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2402.0s)]
*  And I go, dude, that was a joke. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2405.0s)]
*  I'm not moving to fucking Reno and retiring as like a comic. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2408.0s)]
*  And he goes, ah, fuck. I thought it was a good idea. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2412.0s)]
*  And I'm like, no. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2416.0s)]
*  And so that's the last time I talked to him. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2417.0s)]
*  And then his close, close friends, closest friend, Lori Joe, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2420.0s)]
*  I hit her up after Norman passed and I was like, hey, are you doing OK? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2425.0s)]
*  And she goes, one of the last things before Norm died, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2429.0s)]
*  one of the last things he talked about was moving to Reno with you. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2433.0s)]
*  No. Yeah. And I go, are you serious? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2436.0s)]
*  She goes, yeah. He was like he really wanted to do that. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2438.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, and then they made me cry again. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2442.0s)]
*  And yeah, it was just that was Norm. It was really it was awful. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2444.0s)]
*  Damn. I'll tell you, I have so many Norm stories, but this is one of my favorites. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2449.0s)]
*  And I was on tour, me, Sandler Spade, Rob Schneider, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2454.0s)]
*  and Norm was kind of like the wild card. He would pop in for certain dates. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2458.0s)]
*  So we're and believe Mohican Son in Connecticut. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2462.0s)]
*  We're backstage. Everyone's in Sandler's green room talking, shooting shit. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2465.0s)]
*  And me and Norm are in the hallway hanging out. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2469.0s)]
*  And I don't know why did this this long hallway and this guy walks in [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2471.0s)]
*  way down the hallway, walks in the door. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2477.0s)]
*  And I'm like looking and you know, we're always kind of suspicious about people come backstage. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2479.0s)]
*  And I go, I think that guy's a gun. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2483.0s)]
*  And Norm goes, what? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2487.0s)]
*  And I go, I think that guy's a fucking gun, dude. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2490.0s)]
*  And he's like, oh, my God. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2493.0s)]
*  And he runs into Sandler's room and he goes, there's a gun. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2495.0s)]
*  There's a man with a gun. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2498.0s)]
*  I was like, no, no, no, there's not. There's not. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2500.0s)]

*  But I don't know if that's true. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2731.0s)]
*  Some people say he never did any drugs. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2733.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2735.0s)]

*  Whoever the teacher was, he was always at odds with. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2856.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, Miss Crabapple or whatever it was. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2858.0s)]
*  But anyway, so I get up there. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2861.0s)]
*  Oh, in the morning. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2866.0s)]
*  Oh, so Mathers is there, right? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2868.0s)]
*  And I said to him, I was like, he's like, I was just talking. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2870.0s)]
*  I was a huge fan. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2873.0s)]
*  I had signed. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2874.0s)]
*  I bought an autographed picture of him when I was a kid. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2875.0s)]
*  I had it on my wall at home. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2877.0s)]
*  I had a Jerry Mathers autographed picture on my wall at home. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2879.0s)]
*  That is gross. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2881.0s)]
*  Because his name was Theodore and my name Theodore. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2882.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2885.0s)]
*  So I was just keyed in, right? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2886.0s)]
*  Anyway, I wish this story would end. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2888.0s)]
*  You were like, leave it to Sleezer, dude. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2893.0s)]
*  He had a picture on fucking thrown on your fucking eggnog. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2895.0s)]
*  He goes, where do you live? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2898.0s)]
*  I said, I live in Santa Monica. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2900.0s)]
*  He goes, I used to get some pussy in Santa Monica. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2902.0s)]
*  That's exactly what he said, bro. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2905.0s)]
*  So right there, I'm a little shook. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2908.0s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2910.0s)]
*  You know, I'm still excited that it's him, but I'm a little shook. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2911.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2913.0s)]
*  But anyway, in the morning, Norm's downstairs. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2914.0s)]
*  It's a poker tournament. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2916.0s)]
*  That's part of the weekend deal, the package. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2917.0s)]
*  And Norm's like, man, a lot of hot chicks here, huh? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2920.0s)]
*  And I'm looking around. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2922.0s)]
*  It's like nobody's that nobody's hot in this area. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2923.0s)]
*  Right. There hasn't been anybody hot here. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2927.0s)]
*  If somebody here were hot, you would know about it immediately. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2928.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2932.0s)]
*  They'd be on a calendar. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2933.0s)]
*  They would be on the news. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2934.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2935.0s)]
*  Dead Earl. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2936.0s)]
*  Yeah, they would be on the news, bro. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2937.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2941.0s)]
*  If a decent strand of jeans passed through this town, the fucking fire alarms would go [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2942.0s)]
*  off, right? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2948.0s)]
*  There has not been. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2949.0s)]
*  They would be up from the news to a milk carton in like a week. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2950.0s)]
*  There has not been a unique strand of GTAC to roll through this area in fucking since [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2953.0s)]
*  fucking what? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2961.0s)]
*  Norm was definitely on pills. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2962.0s)]
*  If he was like looking around, right? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2963.0s)]
*  I have some tail hair. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2965.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2967.0s)]
*  So I thought he was serious, right? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2968.0s)]
*  Because I don't really know him. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2970.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, man, there definitely is. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2971.0s)]
*  And then he goes, fuck, no, there is. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2973.0s)]
*  That's that's so him. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2976.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2980.0s)]
*  He like baited me into believing that he was fucking pulled the rug out. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2981.0s)]
*  Did he was like, no, there isn't. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2987.0s)]
*  It's so hard because you never I mean, I was one of his good friends for a long time. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2990.0s)]
*  I'm talking like 15 years. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2994.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2996.0s)]
*  And I still was like I could kind of gauge. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=2997.0s)]
*  But sometimes I was like, what is he saying? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3000.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3003.0s)]
*  But he he was out of his out of this world. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3004.0s)]
*  And did he chase a lot of women? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3007.0s)]
*  Did he have a wife or anything? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3008.0s)]
*  No, I never met a wife. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3009.0s)]
*  He has a son, Dylan, who's really cool. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3011.0s)]
*  So he must have did sex once at least. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3013.0s)]
*  I mean, I never saw he was addicted. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3016.0s)]
*  He was a big gambler. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3018.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3020.0s)]
*  I love to gamble. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3021.0s)]
*  And he he had a bit. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3022.0s)]
*  He always had so many gay jokes, but I never knew him to be gay or anything. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3025.0s)]
*  But he had a joke. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3029.0s)]
*  It was on Letterman and I know it was Conan. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3030.0s)]
*  And he goes, he is promoting his book. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3033.0s)]
*  And he says, it's not a memoir, but it's just it's a book. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3036.0s)]
*  He goes, you know, I don't talk about being deeply, deeply closeted gay man. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3041.0s)]
*  And Conan goes, what? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3047.0s)]
*  You're gay. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3049.0s)]
*  And he goes, what? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3050.0s)]
*  No, I just say that. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3051.0s)]
*  He goes, we just said he goes, no, I'm I'm deeply closeted. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3052.0s)]
*  And he goes, so you're not gay. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3056.0s)]
*  He's like, no, no, straight as an arrow. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3057.0s)]
*  He goes, and I'm paraphrasing. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3059.0s)]
*  Forgive me. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3062.0s)]
*  But he goes, you know, deeply closeted means the guy who's gay, but he's so gay, he won't admit it. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3063.0s)]
*  He hides it. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3068.0s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, no, I'm straight. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3069.0s)]
*  It was such a fucking good bit. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3072.0s)]
*  Again, I fucking paraphrase it, but it's on YouTube. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3074.0s)]
*  That's funny, man. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3078.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was great. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3079.0s)]
*  Yeah, I watched one of his clips and he was on I think the view. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3080.0s)]
*  Did you see that clip? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3083.0s)]
*  No, when they're trying to get him to like he's trying to be very realistic. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3084.0s)]
*  The show is like ultra liberal and he's just trying to be just a realist like. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3088.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's how he was. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3092.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3093.0s)]
*  And they're like, they won't. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3094.0s)]
*  They're like, you'll never be back on this show. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3095.0s)]
*  They're all joking about it and stuff. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3097.0s)]
*  And he well, he wouldn't because he wasn't like just kind of conforming to whatever. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3098.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know, just some ridiculous story. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3102.0s)]
*  They have him on. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3104.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3106.0s)]
*  That's so weird. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3107.0s)]
*  Like, he's so not I can see him doing it like if they offered it to him, but I can't. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3108.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3113.0s)]
*  Let's get a little bit of it. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3114.0s)]
*  That the Democrats don't steal the election from the winner, you know, but who knows? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3115.0s)]
*  You like George Bush. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3121.0s)]
*  I love George Bush, man. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3125.0s)]
*  He's a good man, decent, you know, none of this. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3127.0s)]
*  He's a, you know, he's not a liar, a crook, murderer or anything like that. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3130.0s)]
*  So it'd be good to get the see, I think we should get the homicide out of the White House and get like a fresh start because we don't want any more murderers. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3138.0s)]
*  I think we should just go on to the next question. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3147.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3150.0s)]
*  Oh, Clint, he murdered a guy. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3151.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you're not. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3153.0s)]
*  You're not. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3154.0s)]
*  No accusations without that's a little too far. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3155.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is not my week. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3157.0s)]
*  What can I tell you? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3162.0s)]
*  Oh, it's not mine either. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3163.0s)]
*  I'm being very nice. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3165.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3166.0s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3167.0s)]
*  Now, Norm, do you know? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3170.0s)]
*  No, no, I don't want to get into this and I don't want to hear it. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3172.0s)]
*  And this is not the place to make those accusations. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3175.0s)]
*  And you're supposed to be funny. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3178.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3180.0s)]
*  This is a live show. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3183.0s)]
*  This is a live show. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3185.0s)]
*  But you have been properly chastised by Barclay. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3186.0s)]
*  So I'm not going to ask the next question. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3189.0s)]
*  I thought it was a matter of record. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3192.0s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3193.0s)]

*  going against the grain. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3407.0s)]
*  Like when I was in school, when I was a kid, I just would go rogue to make people laugh. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3408.0s)]

*  And some, you know, I think a lot of comedians, even if they don't do it on stage, they, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3418.0s)]

*  That's where like the big thing is. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3582.0s)]
*  And you go out to sandbars and there's beaches out there. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3583.0s)]
*  And so like boating is a big thing. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3586.0s)]
*  Everybody's got a boat and they got a golf cart to travel by golf carts. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3588.0s)]

*  Is there some of that? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3597.0s)]
*  No, it's not a nudist colony. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3598.0s)]
*  Could you do it? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3601.0s)]
*  One of my sisters did drugs one time and climbed up to a nudist colony on accident. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3602.0s)]
*  She was mountain climbing with a friend. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3606.0s)]
*  She said she was. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3607.0s)]
*  She was on drugs. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3608.0s)]
*  But those should not go together. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3609.0s)]
*  Drugs and mountain climbing. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3611.0s)]
*  And they climbed up to some place. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3613.0s)]
*  What drug was it? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3615.0s)]

*  She's like, we went climbing and next, you know, we had to have lunch at that nudist colony. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3631.0s)]
*  Apparently they got to like a some place where they had like some nudes up there, some, you know, on top of a mountain or like at a flat area that's along like by a mountain. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3634.0s)]

*  I was supposed to do those shows. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3815.0s)]
*  And I was at the bar at the hotel and I'm watching the Vikings play the Saints in the [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3817.0s)]
*  playoffs. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3822.0s)]
*  I'm a Vikings fan. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3823.0s)]
*  I'm Minnesota. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3824.0s)]

*  Casey Keenum to Stefan Diggs. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3828.0s)]
*  And the bar was full and nobody's watching the game because it's Denver. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3831.0s)]
*  So I'm watching it and I'm like, oh, my God. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3835.0s)]
*  And I I've rarely done this. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3839.0s)]
*  I just started screaming and I fell down on my knees and I put my hand over my head and [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3841.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3846.0s)]
*  And I started to tear up. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3847.0s)]
*  And then everybody thought that I was having like a problem, like a heart attack, like [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3848.0s)]
*  an aneurysm. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3854.0s)]

*  Hey, hey, hey. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3858.0s)]
*  And then the bartender who I know, I've stayed there for fucking ever. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3859.0s)]
*  And he was like, no, no, no, he's from Minnesota. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3862.0s)]
*  They just scored like a crazy fucking play, like all time insane. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3864.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, oh, Jesus. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3868.0s)]
*  And I was like, I just lost my shit. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3870.0s)]
*  I really lost it. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3874.0s)]
*  That's one of the biggest I've lost. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3875.0s)]
*  What about you? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3876.0s)]
*  You're a Saints fan, aren't you? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3877.0s)]

*  I can't hear you. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3891.0s)]
*  My other favorite was against the Saints and Kyle Rudolph called it touchdown. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3895.0s)]
*  And so I'm the only one. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3899.0s)]

*  Um, I you know what? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3914.0s)]
*  I was pretty burned. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3918.0s)]
*  That was one of the worst moments ever as a Saints fan, for sure. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3919.0s)]
*  But yeah, that had to be awful. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3922.0s)]
*  I paused the game for the fourth quarter for like it was later, I think, three and a half [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3923.0s)]
*  minutes left and I stopped him because I had to do my podcast because I had to get it out for the next day. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3927.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3932.0s)]
*  So towards the end of the I figure I'm just going to watch the end of the game when I get done. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3933.0s)]
*  We're up by, you know, we're up by and you guys had the ball. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3936.0s)]
*  So I was like, oh, we got this. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3941.0s)]
*  We're going to move on to the next round. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3942.0s)]
*  And then my brother called. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3944.0s)]
*  I saw him kept calling. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3946.0s)]
*  So I actually put the call into the episode and I was like, what's going on? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3948.0s)]
*  He's like, man, you just you're not going to believe this. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3952.0s)]
*  And we might even be able to maybe we can put the clip in if we do, it'll be right here. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3956.0s)]
*  But he's like, they did some type of play in the angle that offensive guys had. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3959.0s)]
*  It just and we lost the game. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3964.0s)]
*  And I'm like, how did we fucking it was impossible. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3966.0s)]
*  And you went to your DVR and we're like, hello, dark. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3970.0s)]
*  Well, we didn't even do a crazy play. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3975.0s)]
*  Everybody hurts like he just went low and Stefan jumped over him or he should have just gone in full body. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3977.0s)]
*  Yeah. He just tried to do like a little I think it's called a Falcon crest. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3984.0s)]
*  Yeah. And yeah, I felt bad for the defenders. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3989.0s)]
*  I did too. That shit was horrible. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3993.0s)]
*  But the best play I've ever seen, I was there when Kobe scored 81 points. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3995.0s)]
*  I remember that was kind of an interesting time. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=3998.0s)]
*  That's the only Laker game I've ever been to, actually. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4001.0s)]
*  And what else, dude? Oh, you know, Sam was making a movie about Sean Payton. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4004.0s)]
*  Kevin James is playing Sean Payton. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4009.0s)]
*  I almost auditioned to be in it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4011.0s)]
*  You should have gone in for that shit and played Sean Payton's wife or something. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4013.0s)]
*  I should have. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4016.0s)]
*  Or his concubine. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4017.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if he has a concubine. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4018.0s)]
*  I could have played Alvin Kamara maybe or. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4020.0s)]
*  You could have. Yeah. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4022.0s)]
*  Drew Brees if I'd have been in a freaking wheelchair. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4024.0s)]
*  What? Drew Brees is dope. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4027.0s)]
*  No, Drew Brees. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4029.0s)]
*  Say if Drew Brees got hit by like a car or something. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4031.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4034.0s)]
*  Like in an alternate universe. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4035.0s)]
*  He's just going to change the whole storyline. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4036.0s)]
*  Yeah, an alternate universe. There's a guy named Drew Brees. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4038.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he still plays. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4040.0s)]
*  I mean, he's like they want him to play, but he can't, you know. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4042.0s)]
*  But he still does. He's Drew Brees. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4046.0s)]
*  He's like the Stephen Hawking of footballers kind of. Right. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4048.0s)]
*  You know, he's like left blue 50, blue 50. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4051.0s)]
*  And he just has like a T-shirt cannon instead of like an arm. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4054.0s)]
*  So he's just like, and just shoots the ball every place. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4060.0s)]
*  Hail Mary. That would be a fucking amazing movie. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4063.0s)]
*  Did we just wrote a fucking hit movie? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4068.0s)]
*  Oh, we're good. Yeah, I actually I got a pretty good and I didn't go in. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4070.0s)]
*  I should have probably canceled it. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4073.0s)]
*  You had a podcast. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4075.0s)]
*  Probably because podcast is in my control. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4077.0s)]
*  It's like I like to do stuff that's in my control. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4080.0s)]
*  You know, I actually might start a podcast. Really? Yeah. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4082.0s)]
*  Everybody's just been telling me, they're like, why don't you do one? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4085.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know, because I just it's hard doing the road and filming. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4088.0s)]
*  And so it'd be nice to just do a pod. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4091.0s)]
*  Did you get plastic surgery while you were down there? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4094.0s)]
*  No, why? Your eyes look more like magnetic. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4096.0s)]
*  Kind of. I got magnets in my eyes. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4099.0s)]
*  Is that what you mean? Oh, that could have been it. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4101.0s)]
*  Yeah, they injected magnetism. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4103.0s)]
*  Really? Are you a bell? Oh, Avalon. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4105.0s)]

*  And then also I have magnets in my eyes. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4123.0s)]
*  So if there's somebody's a robot near me, my eyes go right on their dick or jeans. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4125.0s)]
*  And yeah, it's exciting. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4131.0s)]
*  Do you think we'll still have comedy in the future? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4135.0s)]
*  Nick, do you think that this is something that's going to be around for a while? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4137.0s)]
*  You know, you start to see a comedian died the other day. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4140.0s)]
*  This guy, Matt Billin, Matt Bylin, Bylin, I think. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4145.0s)]
*  Matt Bylin. What prompted do you think comedy will be around in the future? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4150.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4155.0s)]
*  When are people going to not like laughing? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4156.0s)]
*  Well, because here's what's happening. Robots. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4158.0s)]
*  Well, they can they have so much they can create everything now. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4161.0s)]
*  So it's like at a certain point, you still going to need people when they can just create a bot of a human. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4166.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like comedy bot or what do you mean? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4170.0s)]
*  Well, like they're just starting to create like. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4174.0s)]
*  So anyway, this comedian that passed away, Matt Bealon, Bylin, Billon, Billon, maybe Billon. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4176.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4183.0s)]
*  I looked the other day. I went on Facebook. I put Matt Billon death. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4184.0s)]
*  Right. So I was just trying to find out what had happened. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4188.0s)]
*  I didn't. I just heard. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4191.0s)]
*  And there were all these articles that were written, but they were written by bots. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4192.0s)]
*  So it's like, oh, that's interesting. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4196.0s)]
*  Now, like because some of it didn't make sense, it would have like some information and then like a ad for like Zales, like written right into the typing. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4198.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Right. It's gross. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4205.0s)]
*  But it's like five of the six things I even found about him passing away were written by bots. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4207.0s)]
*  Why don't you just call somebody that's a comic? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4215.0s)]
*  Right. I agree. But I just started stand up comic. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4217.0s)]
*  But it's just interesting that inform like bots are writing articles now and some of the articles they it was you got the you under you. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4219.0s)]
*  You know, it was information without information. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4230.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4233.0s)]
*  No. Well, that's like a discount. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4234.0s)]
*  But you got the information. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4236.0s)]
*  But that's like thing about Instagram, too, is like I would meet people or friends of mine that are like whatever personalities. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4237.0s)]
*  But I would look on their Instagram and like they have two hundred thousand followers. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4246.0s)]
*  Mike, that's fucking crazy. I didn't know they were fucking crushing it that hard. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4251.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then I would like click on a photo. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4254.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, it's cool photo. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4256.0s)]
*  And there'll be all these comments. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4257.0s)]
*  I would like click on them like they would be like, hey, awesome picture. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4259.0s)]
*  Have a great day. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4265.0s)]
*  Yeah. Bubble and all these comments from like, who the fuck is this? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4266.0s)]
*  And click on it. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4269.0s)]
*  And then a couple of my friends I called out and Mike, bro, there's who is Z Bob Zozo Z like somebody. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4271.0s)]
*  And they'd be like, oh, like you're not even using my holes. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4279.0s)]
*  That's what it'll say. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4283.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4284.0s)]
*  That would be amazing if there was like a system that would sell you like bot comments, but it was just they could say whatever they want. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4286.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's a lot of bots out there. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4293.0s)]
*  I just fucked your mom. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4295.0s)]
*  What do you think comedy will be like in the future? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4296.0s)]
*  I mean, where do you see it? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4298.0s)]
*  Do you think it'll always be around or do you think stand up comedy or it too could get bought it out? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4299.0s)]
*  Stand up comedy. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4304.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course, because there's nothing like seeing a live show. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4306.0s)]
*  There's just nothing like it. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4309.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4310.0s)]
*  When you see a comic live, you know, you don't know what's what's going to happen. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4311.0s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4315.0s)]
*  But they what about all those people that died at that one event recently? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4317.0s)]
*  You see that thing that Travis Scott thing? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4319.0s)]
*  Was he doing stand up? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4322.0s)]
*  No, he's just singing. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4323.0s)]
*  But no, yeah, that was awful. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4324.0s)]
*  Those people got crushed. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4326.0s)]
*  I saw a video of like that a soccer match in England and it's one of the worst. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4328.0s)]
*  I wish I could unsee it. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4332.0s)]
*  And it was a fucking mob pushing against the gate. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4334.0s)]
*  And it was like a fucking almost like a cheese grater. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4337.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4603.160000000001s)]
*  How long you been sober for? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4604.160000000001s)]
*  Um, two months. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4605.160000000001s)]

*  You have one more question. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4611.200000000001s)]
*  Since that, I know one of the questions that came in that was good. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4612.200000000001s)]
*  Let's get it in. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4615.200000000001s)]
*  What's up, Theo? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4618.84s)]
*  What's up, Nick? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4619.84s)]
*  I'm Theo from Virginia. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4621.12s)]
*  I know both you guys in the past have struggled with drugs and alcohol. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4623.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4629.56s)]
*  And myself as well fell victim to the dark arts recently. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4630.56s)]
*  And I'm going into residential rehab here in a couple days. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4638.72s)]
*  So I was just curious if you guys had any advice for someone trying to achieve long-term [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4643.56s)]
*  sobriety. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4649.32s)]

*  Okay. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4653.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, do you want to take it or do you want me to jump in first? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4654.799999999999s)]
*  I think whatever. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4656.599999999999s)]
*  And we can also, I mean, I just felt like this is we could try to just share anything or [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4657.599999999999s)]
*  experience, you know? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4661.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's tricky. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4664.4s)]
*  It depends upon, A, is it drugs and alcohol? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4665.4s)]
*  Drugs, which drug? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4669.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4671.32s)]
*  I've done every drug. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4672.32s)]
*  You've probably done every drug. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4673.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think I have. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4674.32s)]
*  I never smoked crack. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4675.32s)]
*  I've smoked crack. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4676.32s)]
*  You have? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4677.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4678.32s)]
*  I've never smoked crack. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4679.32s)]
*  Me neither. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4680.32s)]
*  I always wanted to smoke crack. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4681.32s)]
*  I did it like kind of on accident. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4682.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4683.32s)]
*  I only did it once and I was like, oh, it's this. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4684.32s)]
*  And then I was like, what are you? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4685.32s)]
*  And they're like, that's crack. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4686.32s)]
*  And I'm like, why? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4687.32s)]
*  I can't feel my lips. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4688.32s)]
*  You can hear the train it coming. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4689.88s)]
*  That's what I hear. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4691.08s)]
*  I hear if I, I just hear it's all aboard, dude. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4692.08s)]
*  That crack train, boy. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4694.32s)]
*  I know. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4695.88s)]
*  Fucking spray hound too, dude. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4696.88s)]
*  Welcome all aboard the spray hound. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4698.24s)]
*  You will just start. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4700.48s)]
*  I mean, I heard you can't even stop just the E jack from coming out of you. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4701.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4705.04s)]
*  I just, I did it. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4706.04s)]
*  I was like, I don't want to do that. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4707.76s)]
*  Accidental crack? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4709.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4710.76s)]
*  I was like, I already fucked up and somebody handed me a pipe. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4711.76s)]
*  It was fucking glass. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4713.44s)]
*  And I thought it was fucking, there was some white shit in it. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4714.44s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, what's this thing? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4717.36s)]
*  I want to smoke till my fucking wife and kids are gone. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4720.32s)]
*  That's what I want to do. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4723.4s)]
*  I mean, yeah, why not? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4724.4s)]
*  But yeah, it was a crack accident. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4725.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4726.4s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4727.4s)]
*  Well, no, I should take this seriously. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4728.4s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4729.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4730.96s)]
*  It really depends upon you and you know, I'm not a fucking doctor, but in my experience, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4732.88s)]
*  which is kind of what you asked, it's tricky. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4740.36s)]
*  I mean, that's an understatement, but you've got to just really, I had to pull back a lot [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4743.56s)]
*  because I, I've been hospitalized a couple of times for alcohol and I had to really get [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4749.92s)]
*  what I wanted out of my life and really take time for myself. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4757.12s)]
*  And you know, it sounds corny, but love yourself and appreciate yourself and the people that [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4761.8s)]
*  care about you and just look at the big picture. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4765.48s)]
*  And it's, you know, I've seen a lot of people go the opposite and not make it out. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4768.32s)]
*  You really have to figure out what you want to do. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4773.28s)]
*  I mean, do you, I don't know. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4777.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4780.4s)]
*  But really messy answer. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4781.4s)]
*  But no, I think it's a good point. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4782.84s)]
*  That's a great, that's a great answer. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4785.04s)]
*  I think because that really determines it. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4786.28s)]
*  It's not up to any invisible power. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4788.48s)]
*  I mean, it could be up to God if you need to find a higher power to help you. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4790.28s)]
*  But yeah, I think trying to have some semblance of what your goal is for yourself, because [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4794.24s)]
*  a lot of times I find if I'm not, if I'm goalless and I don't have any real intention, then [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4799.52s)]
*  I'm much more likely to fall into the dark arts really for me. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4804.96s)]
*  You know, if I'm just letting the world affect me, however, and I don't have a plan every [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4809.0s)]
*  day when I kind of wake up, then of course I'm gonna fall prey to whatever. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4812.6s)]
*  And there's a lot of dark forces out there, man. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4817.04s)]
*  You know, fricking everything, man. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4819.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4821.76s)]
*  Anything will pull you in. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4822.76s)]
*  It's really, I mean, in my experience, I've gone back and forth to talk all and I've been [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4823.96s)]
*  on podcasts and talked about it. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4830.76s)]
*  I've been hospitalized and whatnot. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4831.92s)]
*  And I finally just had to find a reason and goals like Theo said, or I'm like, you know, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4834.320000000001s)]
*  this is what I want to do. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4841.6s)]
*  You got to like care about yourself and stuff like that. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4842.6s)]
*  And drugs are different. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4846.040000000001s)]
*  So I don't know what drugs you're into. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4847.040000000001s)]
*  But in my experience, it was alcohol and drugs, drugs just that just made me feel like shit. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4849.120000000001s)]
*  Like when I would, I did coke, you know, a handful of times you've had the for a handful. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4854.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4860.040000000001s)]
*  A handful many times. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4861.040000000001s)]
*  But yeah, it's a while. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4864.280000000001s)]
*  Eat a squirrel from the backside on coke, dude. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4866.400000000001s)]
*  That stuff will really my God. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4868.8s)]
*  You can do that. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4871.0s)]
*  You will start at the back of an animal, Sonny, and get to know it. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4872.0s)]
*  But you've got to want to help yourself. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4875.96s)]
*  You really do. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4877.56s)]
*  Like if if you will, you know, just reach out, seek help if you need it. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4878.56s)]
*  And but you really, really, really it comes down to you and wanting to to get help and [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4884.16s)]
*  get off that shit, man. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4890.92s)]
*  And it's easier said than done. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4892.16s)]
*  But I've been down that road and sometimes it takes a wake up call. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4893.36s)]
*  And I had a couple and sometimes you fucking don't wake up. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4898.32s)]
*  A lot of my friends, you know, I mean, you've had friends who have died. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4901.5599999999995s)]
*  I've had half of the comedian friends I know. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4904.44s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's just sad. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4907.16s)]
*  You know, especially in the pandemic has been a tough time for a lot of people. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4909.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think, look, yeah, I mean, I find that 12 step has helped me. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4913.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, I struggle. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4918.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm thinking about going to a place in January for a couple of weeks just to even [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4919.84s)]
*  just get I'm not even struggling or anything right now, but just to have some time for [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_NQiLghl4&t=4924.24s)]
