*  Today's guest is a singer-songwriter out of Ireland. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=63.04s)]
*  And Ireland is one of the most beautiful and complex and simple places all at the same [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=68.76s)]
*  time. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=77.64s)]
*  Wonderful time that I had there recently. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=78.64s)]
*  I'm really grateful to spend time with them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=80.6s)]
*  I've been a fan for years and we've been in touch for years and glad to make this happen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=82.64s)]
*  He has had hits like Paradise and Kiss Me amongst many others. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=88.76s)]
*  I got to see him play last night here in Nashville, Tennessee. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=94.12s)]
*  Today's guest is my friend, Dermot Kennedy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=99.12s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=112.64s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=125.24s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=128.04s)]
*  I didn't mean I meant that for me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=134.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=137.4s)]
*  I like that you did it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=138.4s)]
*  Dude, yeah, listen, I think after like the first song last night, I leaned over to your [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=142.68s)]
*  I was like, God, I might be gay, dude. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=146.96s)]
*  I was like, this is really awesome, man. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=149.52s)]
*  It felt so serious. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=154.28s)]
*  Like I was saying to you afterwards, it felt like a very serious show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=156.64s)]
*  When I play headline show, we've got moments that are down and somber and the moments that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=159.0s)]
*  are fun and up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=162.96s)]
*  When I do a show like that, like The Bluebird last night, it stays serious and I haven't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=164.68s)]
*  done that in a long time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=169.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=170.08s)]
*  I think crowds sometimes want both. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=171.16000000000003s)]
*  So I would worry while I'm doing it if people are kind of like, this is a lot of seriousness, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=173.28s)]
*  you know? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Like it feels serious here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, which it should be. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  I take it seriously, but it's just like, I think sometimes you need relief. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  But I think then as well, I like having funny moments in between songs talking to people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=184.52s)]
*  because I don't take life very seriously, but I take the songs very seriously. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=193.0s)]
*  When you got into the songs, you were at Bluebird Cafe last night for our listeners and that's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  a small venue in Nashville and it's probably, I mean, it may seat 60. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=198.24s)]
*  Yeah, if even. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=203.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=204.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=205.96s)]
*  And I mean, we were sitting, I was in the second row and I was five feet from Gabe Simon, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=206.96s)]
*  who was playing with you, accompanying you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=213.0s)]
*  And like I could have done a couple of notes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  I could have. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=218.44s)]
*  You could have. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=219.44s)]
*  You should have. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=220.44s)]
*  Yeah, I could have chimed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=221.44s)]
*  Literally, I could have chimed in. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=222.44s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been nice. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=223.44s)]
*  It would have been a very welcome thing, I think. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=224.44s)]
*  But yeah, it was captivating, man. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=226.84s)]
*  It was so incredible. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=228.56s)]
*  I was like, yeah, it felt so intense in there at moments. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=229.56s)]
*  You could see everybody going through like, I mean, I was going through the history of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  relationships and I felt bad. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  After one song, I was like, I got to text this one gal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=239.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, we spend so little, I think we kind of, in daily life, we go through the motions [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  and I think I would like to think moments like that maybe put you in a spot where you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  think about life and just assess things a little bit. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  So, like, that's what it does for me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=256.04s)]
*  I don't know who I'd be without it, you know what I mean? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=258.56s)]
*  I think sometimes in terms of the therapy and catharsis I get from it, I think I'd take [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=260.72s)]
*  it for granted 100%. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't know who I'd be without that outlet, you know what I mean? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  And I find it difficult. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Sometimes it's tricky. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=270.6s)]
*  Like last night, start of the show, I loved it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=271.6s)]
*  End of the show, I was feeling good. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  In the middle of the show, I kind of went within myself for some reason. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=275.8s)]
*  But yeah, I think I'd be a much worse person if I had all that emotion kind of bottled [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=278.56s)]
*  up, you know? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  Are the Irish notorious for, like, struggling to show emotion or something? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  I think there's definitely issues in terms of, like, men in particular, I think in terms [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=291.44s)]
*  of not opening up to people. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=297.2s)]
*  I think it's something that's improving constantly. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=299.24s)]
*  But definitely. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=302.44s)]
*  And I think, I mean, it's no surprise that Ireland has a rich history in the arts because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=303.44s)]
*  that's how it comes out, you know what I mean? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=307.76s)]
*  Authors, actors, musicians, everything. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=309.56s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=311.96s)]
*  It was crazy, dude. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=312.96s)]
*  It was like, I went through it all. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=314.56s)]
*  I was sitting there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=316.48s)]
*  I was like, I got home and I texted an ex-girlfriend. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=317.96s)]
*  I was like, I think I owe you a call, you know? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=320.8s)]
*  That's a nice thing, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=323.32s)]
*  No, it's good. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=324.32s)]
*  And yeah, I'm glad I did. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=325.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of ballads there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=327.12s)]
*  I know, yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=329.88s)]
*  I was thinking where you... [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=330.88s)]
*  And it's because you don't have all the instrumental. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=332.12s)]
*  Like I've listened to your albums where it's like you have the whole, and some of those [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=334.32s)]
*  are upbeat songs and it's different. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=336.92s)]
*  When you're playing them, just right there for everybody. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=339.32s)]
*  Totally. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=341.52s)]
*  How you frame something is so important. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=342.76s)]
*  I even laughed when you were singing Kiss Me There a minute ago because that to me is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=344.32s)]
*  one of the best songs I've made lyrically in terms of how it's put together. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  But if I could do it again, it would just be me and a guitar. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=353.08s)]
*  It'd be like last night, you know what I mean? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think you frame things in a certain way for certain goals and stuff. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=358.44s)]
*  But when I play that song by itself, I'm like, oh, it should be this way. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=363.64s)]
*  I think it takes courage to take everything away from a song. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=367.0s)]
*  And it's only recently I've kind of got that back. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=371.72s)]
*  Because like I said last night, when I would play shows like that when I was younger, I [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  felt so confident, you know what I mean? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  Because I loved that no one knew who I was and I loved that I had something to bring [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=379.36s)]
*  to the table and people might be excited. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=382.88000000000005s)]
*  And I felt, like I said last night, I felt borderline kind of arrogant about it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=384.6s)]
*  But now when I'm doing it, I got quite nervous for last night. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=388.8s)]
*  But if it's like 10,000 people, I don't get nervous at all. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  But things like last night, I do get a bit nervous, yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=394.12s)]
*  Yeah, just now when you said like, it used to be nice to be a surprise. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=400.32000000000005s)]
*  That was the best. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=401.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=404.0s)]
*  That's one thing I miss the most about, you know, I'm grateful for having like people [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=405.0s)]
*  come out and people get to know you and stuff. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=410.8s)]
*  But it was awesome when only you knew you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=412.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=416.4s)]
*  In a way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=417.4s)]
*  And you got to be this like, you were like, were always your secret because you're you, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=418.4s)]
*  right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=422.96s)]
*  And you build up this, especially as a comedian, you build up this sort of rapport with how [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=423.96s)]
*  to interact with the world and to surprise people like, what, how did, what is this guy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=428.04s)]
*  talking? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=432.92s)]
*  Like that always seemed interesting to me. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=433.92s)]
*  And then people get to know how your instrument works or it's just the surprise isn't there [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=436.44s)]
*  anymore and it's different. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  Totally. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=444.76s)]
*  I mean, that moment, I'm sure you feel this, like that moment where you feel like you've [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=445.76s)]
*  arrived and people know who you are and yet no longer do you surprise people. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  And so you kind of feel like you have to change or deviate from what you're doing and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=454.2s)]
*  to try and keep that feeling. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=458.44s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=459.64s)]
*  I find it difficult. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=460.64s)]
*  I know, like, I know for myself, like, I remember seeing a thing, an interview with Drake years [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=461.64s)]
*  ago and he was just saying that moment where people are sharing your music and kind of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=466.4s)]
*  say, you got to listen to this, you'll never get that back again, no matter how successful [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=469.44s)]
*  you get. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  Because that's the most exciting part. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=476.12s)]
*  I think like for what you do, for what I do, for anyone involved in the arts, I think the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=477.12s)]
*  work is the only thing that's exciting. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  It's the only thing. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=483.72s)]
*  And of course you play big shows and you have ambition and you try and grow your career [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=484.72s)]
*  and all those things are lovely. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=489.6s)]
*  But at the root of it, if you're not, like I always say, you could be miserable playing [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=490.72s)]
*  in stadiums, you know what I mean? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=494.24s)]
*  Or you could be completely content playing shows like last night. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=495.72s)]
*  So I think it's very important to keep that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I noticed when I have some new stuff and that is the most exciting time when I'm [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  ready, when I'm like, wait till I get to this new part of the show and it's going to be [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=504.72s)]
*  fun for me and it's going to be fun for them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=509.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=511.92s)]
*  I'm sure you could play to like 40,000 people and it can go either way. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=512.92s)]
*  It can be completely euphoric or it can kind of feel hollow either way. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=516.7199999999999s)]
*  But it like nothing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=520.64s)]
*  The work is the only thing, I think. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=523.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=525.7199999999999s)]
*  And especially these days, there's so much surrounding things that you have to do to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  kind of manage yourself, you know, like social media and just, I mean, specifically, I guess [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=530.5999999999999s)]
*  social media probably. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  It's such a big world of it all. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you get involved with that side of things? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=540.04s)]
*  Do you run your own stuff and all that? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=541.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=543.52s)]
*  No, I split it with my producers and stuff, you know, but you know, I'm particular kind [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=544.52s)]
*  of about what we put out and like try to be sensitive or try to think, okay, this feels [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=548.28s)]
*  like me. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=553.28s)]
*  Sometimes they're like, no, this is good and I don't have an idea. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=554.28s)]
*  Of course. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=557.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=558.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=559.56s)]
*  So trusting other people sometimes that's with your own voice, you know? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=560.56s)]
*  Totally. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=563.24s)]
*  I think I find it hard sometimes I spend way too much time worrying about how I'm perceived, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=564.24s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=569.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=570.56s)]
*  I think things like social media only make that more kind of inflamed and then yeah, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  you just get closer to forgetting what you're actually truly about. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=576.92s)]
*  So I try and stay away. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  But it's healthy sometimes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, before this conversation gets any gayer, dude, and no offense if it does, dude, I think [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=582.5999999999999s)]
*  Irish people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=588.16s)]
*  No offense to me. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=589.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sorry. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=590.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=591.16s)]
*  No, and probably me, dude. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=592.16s)]
*  I mean, look, who knows what will happen with us. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=593.16s)]
*  But I think, yeah, dude, the Irish are, I couldn't believe what the Irish were. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=596.28s)]
*  I always had an idea. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=602.36s)]
*  That wasn't your first time there though recently, was it? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=604.04s)]
*  It wasn't, but it was my first time really with my eyes open. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=605.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  I saw you in a field with a lot of cows. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  Where was that? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=610.92s)]
*  It was down in Court County. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=611.92s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=613.52s)]
*  Oh, you'll milk anything down there, people. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=614.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=616.52s)]
*  And there's no women. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=617.52s)]
*  This is the thing about how people are always like, oh, the girls are coming. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=618.52s)]
*  They're going to be here. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=620.92s)]
*  And you'll be, you'll go to the next place and the otter are coming. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=622.24s)]
*  The lasses are coming. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=624.28s)]
*  It's a false promise. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=625.28s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=626.28s)]
*  They never come. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=627.28s)]
*  Who made all the men? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=628.28s)]
*  Who, how did they, what did they fall out of? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=629.28s)]
*  Yeah, they're the ones that stuck around, I guess. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=631.8s)]
*  I guess. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=633.8s)]
*  I mean, here I am. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=634.8s)]
*  This is some women we met. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=635.8s)]
*  It was like unbelievable, dude. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=636.8s)]
*  Actually, these are some drunken mixed fellows that we met out there, dude. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=637.8s)]
*  These are the blackest guys I saw in Ireland right here. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=642.8s)]
*  Were you invited to this field? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=645.92s)]
*  No, we got there and we wanted to like just drive out into the distance. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  So we stopped at a farm and a man took us and showed us all about the dairy and gave [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=651.4s)]
*  us fresh milk or whatever. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=657.76s)]
*  And you drank the milk straight from the cow? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  We drank it straight out. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=662.12s)]
*  I mean, it felt, I don't know how old the cow was. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=663.72s)]
*  It felt a little illegal. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=665.64s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=666.64s)]
*  I mean, the first sip, yeah, that's normal. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=667.64s)]
*  But if you, you know, I had a couple of sips and I'm like, you definitely peek around for [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=670.48s)]
*  the police after a bit. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=675.92s)]
*  But it was, yeah, it was just unbelievable. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=678.68s)]
*  We just wanted to see the countryside. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=679.68s)]
*  We wanted to feel something that felt normal. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=681.24s)]
*  A farmer took us into his home and sat at his table. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  No way. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=685.88s)]
*  I'm glad you got around the country. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=686.88s)]
*  I think a lot of people go to Dublin for two or three days and they just experienced that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=687.88s)]
*  But Ireland is a beautiful place and you can see so much of it in like a couple hours. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=691.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=695.88s)]
*  It's a small country. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=696.88s)]
*  So yeah, and you have to see it because if you ask somebody something, you can't understand [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=697.88s)]
*  what they're saying. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=701.48s)]
*  And so you just, you have to just believe that they're going to be okay when you meet [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=702.48s)]
*  a lot of Irish people. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=706.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they love you too. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=707.16s)]
*  Did you like, you had good shows? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=708.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I felt a lot of love and support. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=710.52s)]
*  And it was awesome, you know, I think. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=713.56s)]
*  And it's just such a unique culture. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=716.24s)]
*  Like they just, they have a good time. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  They know how to have a good time. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=721.88s)]
*  They're not as overly concerned with a lot of other bullshit like as we are in the States, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=723.52s)]
*  you know? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=729.16s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=730.16s)]
*  Like if I go on tour in Australia, I feel a similar thing. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=731.16s)]
*  People just don't take it too seriously. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=732.64s)]
*  You've been down there, yeah? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=733.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, Australia is so great, man. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=735.36s)]
*  Yeah, similar thing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=737.12s)]
*  People just, there's no bullshit. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=738.12s)]
*  You feel good energy from people. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=739.36s)]
*  But I have a comedian friend, Mark Hayes, and he's Irish. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=741.12s)]
*  And so he's always queuing me in on just like the shame of the Irish and the, you know, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=744.32s)]
*  the dark, you know, I guess there's a lot of shame over there. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=748.92s)]
*  I guess there is, but also, I don't know if you heard this phrase earlier there about [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=753.28s)]
*  notions, this idea that when you start doing well at anything, you get notions. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=758.2s)]
*  Like you kind of start feeling yourself a bit and you have to be very careful of that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=762.42s)]
*  I think humility, like you see Irish people who just won medals at the Olympics, they [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=765.36s)]
*  just kind of, in the interviews, they're just like, nah, I don't know. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  I stink. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=772.6400000000001s)]
*  They're so mean to themselves. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=773.6400000000001s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=775.5200000000001s)]
*  But yeah, happy medium would be good. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=776.5200000000001s)]
*  I think sometimes you kind of are constantly downplaying what you do. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=778.96s)]
*  And I think it would be nice if people celebrated themselves a bit more. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=782.4000000000001s)]
*  But notions is a real thing. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=786.0s)]
*  I know, like people have said about me, you get to a certain point and some people just [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=787.32s)]
*  don't like you for no reason. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=790.72s)]
*  Yeah, I could maybe see that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=792.0400000000001s)]
*  Because there's this more unity of us as a group. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=793.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=796.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=797.24s)]
*  I remember there was a thing years ago. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=798.24s)]
*  I think it was Damien Rice told the story. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=799.24s)]
*  They were like in a restaurant and there was lobsters. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=801.76s)]
*  And who is Damien Rice? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=803.64s)]
*  He's a brilliant musician from Ireland. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=805.36s)]
*  He had a song called Cannonball and an album called Oh, it's like a classic. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=806.88s)]
*  And he was talking about lobsters in a tank. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it was him. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=813.24s)]
*  I don't mean to attribute this quote to him if it's not him, but he was apparently there [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=814.24s)]
*  was like a lobster trying to get out and another one. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  He was kind of like, oh, careful, it's going to get out. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  And someone's like, no, they're Irish lobsters. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=822.52s)]
*  So the other ones are like, drag it back down. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=823.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=825.28s)]
*  Apparently the shellfish. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=826.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=827.6s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=828.6s)]
*  You feel massive support, too. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=829.72s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=831.0s)]
*  Like, oh, it was the best place in the world for doing anything because people just were [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=832.0s)]
*  so quick to celebrate our own. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=835.8s)]
*  And I love that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=837.48s)]
*  Oh, that's beautiful. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=838.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=839.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=840.48s)]
*  What's that article right there? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=841.48s)]
*  It was about an Olympian Irish rowers brilliant response to winning an Olympic gold medal [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=842.48s)]
*  goes viral. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=843.96s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=844.96s)]
*  Yeah, I can't complain. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=845.96s)]
*  In a BBC interview following the win, the pair were asked Paul O'Donovan, Fenton McCarthy [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=846.96s)]
*  gold medal winning athletes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  How does it sound? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=852.2800000000001s)]
*  How does that sound? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=853.2800000000001s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=854.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  You can't complain about it, really. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=856.2800000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't go around introducing myself. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=857.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's everything. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=858.9200000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't talk about it. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=859.9200000000001s)]
*  But I love that, too, because we do take care of business, but don't talk about it too much. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=860.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a bit more humility. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=865.32s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=866.6s)]
*  Yeah, man, there was so much like there was something you said last night that I really [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=867.6s)]
*  resonated with. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm crap at it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=876.28s)]
*  What about you? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=887.9599999999999s)]
*  I can't like I when things are good. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=891.8399999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm sometimes I feel as if I'm waiting for something bad to happen. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=892.8399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=897.76s)]
*  Like you're almost like just sort of waiting for bad news or bad phone call or something. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=898.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=903.32s)]
*  Instead of just enjoying the fact that it's good right now, I feel very bad at that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=904.32s)]
*  And again, music puts me in a better place. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=907.68s)]
*  But yeah, I feel that way. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=910.4s)]
*  I find it very difficult to settle into a good feeling. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=912.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's hard. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=915.16s)]
*  I mean, the moment it's hard to have the moment you used to I've talked about this before, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=917.16s)]
*  but you used to with the moment, the moment used to be like a real thing because we couldn't [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=920.84s)]
*  record it all the time. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=925.2s)]
*  We couldn't capture it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=926.96s)]
*  So the moment it was like it had so much value. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=929.2s)]
*  The only way you were going to learn about what had happened was through someone else, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=932.24s)]
*  through a storyteller. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=935.84s)]
*  So it promoted so much more storytelling. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=936.84s)]
*  Cameras have taken all that away from us. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=940.9200000000001s)]
*  Not all the time and not all of it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=942.76s)]
*  But it's definitely it's like squashed a lot of that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=944.6s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=950.64s)]
*  The moment if you got to see a girl like at school, you couldn't go home and look at pictures [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=951.64s)]
*  of her. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=955.0s)]
*  You had to imagine. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=956.0s)]
*  Oh, so you would wait till tomorrow. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=957.0s)]
*  And what she was doing and mostly in your mind, you imagine, oh, she's thinking to me. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=958.34s)]
*  She's drawing pictures of me in the walls and everything. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=961.5s)]
*  And then you got to school the next day and she still didn't care about you. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=964.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=967.74s)]
*  Or like you would see that they're online and they're not texting you. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=968.74s)]
*  That type of thing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=971.34s)]
*  Yeah, squashed. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=972.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=973.34s)]
*  So I think like there's like stuff like that I miss because your imagination became so [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=974.34s)]
*  much more of a it did its natural work. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=979.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=982.7s)]
*  I think about it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=983.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=984.7s)]
*  My livelihood comes from my imagination. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=986.1800000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=987.6600000000001s)]
*  That's all I have. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=988.6600000000001s)]
*  And so yeah, you got to be careful. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=989.6600000000001s)]
*  I think what you put in is very important. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=991.3000000000001s)]
*  Like if I read, I can feel it sort of I can feel ideas start to generate. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=993.86s)]
*  If I walk around just all day and stay just literally looking at the most boring stuff, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=998.26s)]
*  I can feel ideas start to come. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1002.82s)]
*  But I got to be careful and not let it get squashed all the time. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1004.34s)]
*  Like what do you mean? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1007.1s)]
*  Like by like get squashed by what? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1008.1s)]
*  As in like if I look at my phone too much, it's just sludge in my brain. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1010.5s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1013.1400000000001s)]
*  It's just bad thoughts and stupid stuff. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1014.22s)]
*  And so like no good song is going to come out of that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1016.34s)]
*  But also I spend so much time traveling by myself and all that kind of thing. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1018.66s)]
*  So it's a yeah, it's a creative. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1021.42s)]
*  I find it difficult. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1023.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1024.74s)]
*  Like I know like we were in your car last week and you were kind of say you thought [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1025.74s)]
*  of something and you were like, oh, I need to write that down. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1028.26s)]
*  And it's that constantly, right? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1030.48s)]
*  You're constantly trying to grab that thing and that moment of inspiration or something [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1031.78s)]
*  that can translate to part of your show. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1034.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1036.86s)]
*  You notice especially like a phrase or a thing like, oh, I've never said that or I never [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1037.86s)]
*  thought about that. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1043.1399999999999s)]
*  After a while, I noticed it's like if it makes me laugh, then it might make somebody else [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1044.8999999999999s)]
*  laugh. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1049.2199999999998s)]
*  So I have to like, you know, because at this point you have to think maybe you and your [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1050.2199999999998s)]
*  audience have some like symbiosis or similar people. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1053.32s)]
*  Yeah, similar. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1058.4599999999998s)]
*  And so yeah, if they told you a song, if they told you a, you know, this thing you just [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1059.6599999999999s)]
*  heard or, you know, she like, oh, this will probably this will probably play. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1063.74s)]
*  Do you base songs like do you kind of start with like a nugget of a line? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1068.62s)]
*  Definitely. Yeah, I find it hard when someone's kind of like what you want to write about [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1072.22s)]
*  is like, I don't know yet. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1074.98s)]
*  Like I have I'll have a lyric in a song last night. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1075.98s)]
*  So the first song I played is called An Evening I'll Not Forget. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1078.9s)]
*  And I know there's a lot of lyrics in that from the best days of my life and from the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1082.0600000000002s)]
*  worst days of my life. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1084.6200000000001s)]
*  And they just mix together. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  So I struggle sometimes when someone's like, what's this song about or what you want to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1086.7s)]
*  write about? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1089.46s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1090.46s)]
*  You know, like, there'll be one lyric about like hanging out with my friends and one lyric [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1091.46s)]
*  about someone passing away and difficult things all mixed in together. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1094.3400000000001s)]
*  But at all, kind of, I think sometimes when I and this is overly serious, but I think [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1098.08s)]
*  like the one lasting message through my music, hopefully, is like a hopeful thing. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1102.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? So if a song seems down, it's never all the way down. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1106.8s)]
*  There's always a hopeful moment. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1110.32s)]
*  And if it's up, it just I'm trying to lift people up a little bit. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1111.44s)]
*  I would like if I could have a goal from people coming to my show is just they feel a bit [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  better about where they're at and how their life is and not in a corny way, but just that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1118.56s)]
*  they kind of think about things and realize that life is good a little bit. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1123.6399999999999s)]
*  I would love that. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1126.56s)]
*  Even a down moment in Ireland is pretty good, probably, I think. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1128.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like I said, I was like, oh, yeah, we'll take it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1131.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, definitely. Yeah. People are good. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1133.8s)]
*  We kind of. Yeah. Like I even I don't know. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1135.28s)]
*  I just when I get too far from home, I kind of miss that feeling. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1137.76s)]
*  I don't know. There's so many people that are happy go lucky. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1140.8s)]
*  Good people. I'm sure you saw tons of them. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1143.0s)]
*  But just yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1145.2s)]
*  So that's what I mean is between songs, I don't feel serious. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1146.84s)]
*  Like we're all on in your monitors on stage and in between songs when we're on tour, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1149.6399999999999s)]
*  it's relentless. Like people shouting at each other. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1155.8s)]
*  And we're all just communicating on stage. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1157.8s)]
*  It's just people like taking the piss out of me while I'm doing something. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1159.36s)]
*  I'll like, yeah. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1162.56s)]
*  So I'm trying to sing through all of that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1164.04s)]
*  Like everybody on stage will be slagging me in some way. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1166.24s)]
*  Am I as well? I'm trying to say something really sincere and then I laugh [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  and the whole crowd will kind of cheer because I look happy. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1172.44s)]
*  But it's really because someone's like slagging me about something. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1175.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1177.36s)]
*  That's there's nobody likes to laugh more, I think, than the Irish, maybe. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1179.04s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Maybe that's something that I realized. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  I was just so. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1186.36s)]
*  Yeah, people just love to fucking laugh. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1188.84s)]
*  It's very sarcastic. Yes. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1191.52s)]
*  In a way, they love to rip on each other. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1192.9599999999998s)]
*  And it's OK. They don't take things as personally. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1194.8s)]
*  No. You know. Yeah. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1197.24s)]
*  In a way that sometimes I'll say something sarcastic over here [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1198.24s)]
*  and it doesn't necessarily land and people think I'm quite serious about it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1202.24s)]
*  So you have to be careful. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1204.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Some of the songs last night, it was like, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1206.8s)]
*  yeah, a lot of them felt like kind of relationship based or trying to like capture [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1210.6s)]
*  a moment from a relationship or relive a relationship or where does some of that [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1215.16s)]
*  energy come from? Does it just do you feel like that that's like been something [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1220.92s)]
*  that's been very important in your life? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1224.12s)]
*  I mean, it's important in a lot of people's lives. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1225.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think like. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1227.76s)]
*  I think even the relationships, you know, sometimes on the bachelor or something. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1229.8799999999999s)]
*  No, I was meant to sing. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1233.28s)]
*  What was I meant to sing on? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1235.0s)]
*  I was meant to sing on the bachelorette years ago and it fell through. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1235.92s)]
*  Thank God. Yeah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1238.72s)]
*  I. But I was. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1239.76s)]
*  Yeah, because after some of the songs, I'm like, Jesus, how many. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1241.84s)]
*  How many? No, you think like this guy's been. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1244.12s)]
*  Yeah, like this guy's been on a lot of dates. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1248.0s)]
*  No, that couldn't be further from the truth. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1251.48s)]
*  But I think sometimes I'll sing a song and it'll be from the perspective of anybody, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1253.8s)]
*  you know, like a family member. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1259.36s)]
*  Sometimes I'll just embody someone else in my life. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1261.48s)]
*  I think it's an interesting thought, right, to think that my community, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1263.72s)]
*  say my close friends and my family at home, we all have the same feelings and emotions. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1267.68s)]
*  It's just icing about it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1271.68s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? And so sometimes I feel like a mouthpiece for them. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1273.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, and that puts me in a good place because I'm not thinking about my own life all the time. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1275.92s)]
*  So that's where all the dates come from. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1281.12s)]
*  I've been on very few. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1283.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's oh, were you not were you not a big data growing up, really? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1284.36s)]
*  No. Oh, man. I was like, I said, I said, these people went to school with me. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1288.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was supply and demand. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1293.24s)]
*  Yeah, I was. That's not your issue. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1296.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1298.16s)]
*  I'd say there's a lot of people went to school with me who have like [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1299.8s)]
*  if they watch this would hear me speak for the first time. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1303.12s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1305.92s)]
*  Would you hate like the public speaking of it or something? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1308.16s)]
*  Public not even public speaking, but just I just felt so awkward in school. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1310.2s)]
*  You know, like we used to. Oh, yeah. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1314.72s)]
*  We used to like go to, you know, the way to have your locker at school [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1316.52s)]
*  and you would get your books for the first half of the day and then get your books for the second [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1319.56s)]
*  and like drop them off. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1322.68s)]
*  I would walk around with every book for the whole day in my bag. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1323.64s)]
*  So I didn't have to go to the lockers for that potential interaction. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1327.08s)]
*  I hated it, man. Yeah, not good. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1330.12s)]
*  God. And is that a kind of a general Irish thing? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1332.44s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't know what it was in me, but I just felt quiet. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1335.72s)]
*  I didn't even nowadays. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1338.8s)]
*  I kind of feel that way. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1340.68s)]
*  I think it's lovely. Like, I'll talk to you and I know we can talk about things [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  and get into it, but just general socializing. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1345.72s)]
*  I suck at it. And I, you know, you get to an age where you don't apologize for it [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1348.44s)]
*  and you don't care anymore. But when I was a kid, yeah, I hated it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1351.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I got so nervous around girls. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1355.0s)]
*  I just remember well on the school bus, I would get so like, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1358.48s)]
*  I would get like erections all the time, I guess, because like the motor going [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1362.3600000000001s)]
*  and they would play like music that we weren't allowed to listen to at home. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1366.0800000000002s)]
*  It was like kind of not sexy music, but just rate pop music or whatever. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1370.48s)]
*  And so I would just have to like, I just would turn my whole body, just like facing [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1375.48s)]
*  just and like, oh, there's a constant state of arrest. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1380.5600000000002s)]
*  In school, you mean? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1384.8400000000001s)]
*  That was just on the bus, dude. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1386.0s)]
*  When I got to school, I think there was so much kind of like violence [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1387.52s)]
*  and stuff at our school that it was hard to stay erect around a lot of violence. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1391.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1394.1200000000001s)]

*  And I saved up as much saliva in my mouth as I could one day. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1423.28s)]
*  And I just spit it right into her hair. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1426.6399999999999s)]

*  Fancy me, I guess, and it got to the point where I like stop putting gel on my hair [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1449.6000000000001s)]
*  and stuff, because I was like, I need to look scruffier for school, so no one pays attention. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1453.96s)]

*  Oh, I thought it was kind of is it in my mind? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1470.1200000000001s)]
*  I would think of a Misty Moore. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1472.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a swamp in the middle of nowhere. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1473.68s)]
*  It makes me think of Jack the Ripper. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1476.24s)]

*  He we don't claim Jack. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1481.44s)]
*  Who's your most famous serial killer over there? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1483.2s)]
*  Well, besides alcoholism, I'm going to say. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1486.16s)]
*  If you if you look at [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1488.92s)]
*  there's a great podcast called West Cork, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1492.16s)]
*  and you could think it's fiction, but it's a true story. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1494.64s)]
*  Now, it's not a serial killer. It's one standalone murder. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1496.6s)]
*  There's very few things like that. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1498.92s)]
*  But but it's an amazing story. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1500.04s)]
*  And it's about this lady that was killed in Cork in West Cork [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1502.72s)]
*  out by the ocean. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1506.68s)]
*  Horrific thing years and years ago, but they still haven't found the person that did it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1508.52s)]
*  And you know how Ireland is like there's a lot of talk in the town about who did it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1512.44s)]
*  And even up until recently, the fellow that they thought did it [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1515.72s)]
*  was like selling pizzas on the market and stuff. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1518.56s)]
*  And everyone will go just to see him and all that kind of stuff. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1520.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But no, I mean, I know I'm wrong, but I don't think there's many serial killers. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1522.92s)]
*  I know here you've got classics, but [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1527.84s)]
*  yeah, yeah, I guess. Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1529.92s)]
*  People is definitely we kill. There's a lot more we kill over here. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1531.44s)]
*  Yeah. Who's your favorite? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1534.96s)]
*  My favorite serial killer. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1536.96s)]
*  That's a great question, man. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1538.28s)]
*  You know. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1541.04s)]
*  There was the BTK serial killer. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1543.76s)]
*  Who's that? He was out of Wichita. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1547.4s)]
*  Mizz Wichita, Kansas, and. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1551.4s)]
*  Yeah, he was like an electrician. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1555.8400000000001s)]
*  He ran. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1557.56s)]
*  He ran like his community church and he was just killing people. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1560.32s)]
*  They're all like weirdly handsome as well, I think. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1565.8799999999999s)]
*  Not him. Not him. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1568.2s)]
*  Well, we've had some of the handsome ones. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1570.6399999999999s)]
*  Ted Bundy, I believe, was the handsome guy. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1571.72s)]
*  You know, Dahmer was a famous one. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1573.8s)]
*  That show is pretty great. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1575.84s)]
*  But yeah, I guess I don't know. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1578.2s)]
*  I should think about that a little bit more. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1580.44s)]
*  Who my favorite one is. Yeah, no, no, there's there's very few things like that in Ireland. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1582.72s)]
*  It's like a small country. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1586.28s)]
*  When you also, yeah, you'd rather if you kill somebody, they're not going to be able to drink anymore. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1588.2s)]
*  Yeah, true. So true. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1592.84s)]
*  It's like, hey, we got to keep this guy alive. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1594.72s)]

*  like trying a new type of milk. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1689.92s)]
*  Sometimes you see this say, oh, Debbie's milk or Randy's milk, and you try it, you know. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1691.6s)]
*  Sometimes it's rolling the dice on a new workout class and seeing if you like it [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1698.8s)]
*  or mixing it up with a new takeout spot, maybe Chinese, maybe Korean. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1704.3999999999999s)]

*  Yeah. Like I even I remember my friend had 50 cents for a album and that was just [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1799.0800000000002s)]
*  huge for me. And it's funny because I listen to it all the time and I never try and [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1804.8000000000002s)]
*  let it influence my music too much because I just be pretending to be a rapper and [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1808.92s)]
*  that would be ridiculous. But it does influence the way I write. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1811.68s)]
*  Like I write verses in a hip hop type way and no one really knows or acknowledges it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1814.0800000000002s)]
*  But to me, I can feel the flow. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1818.72s)]

*  Did you you're here working in Nashville right now on music? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1842.48s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1845.44s)]
*  Have you met up with other artists while you've been here? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1846.3200000000002s)]
*  A little bit. Yeah, it's funny, you know, because like you said, Gabe Simon and [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1848.6000000000001s)]
*  Joshua were with me at the show last night in the Bluebird. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1851.96s)]
*  But also the idea is you kind of you kind of have your friends with you playing [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  songs and it's like you go back and forth. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1859.96s)]
*  I'll do a song. You do a song. They do a song. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1861.8000000000002s)]
*  But like I don't have friends like that. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1864.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? I kind of feel quite solitary when I go to these places. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1867.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, like sometimes, you know, sometimes people have tons of features and have [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1871.2s)]
*  tons of friends on songs. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1875.0400000000002s)]
*  I feel quite. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1876.44s)]
*  Content in this way, but like a bit of a loner in the music biz, I feel like I kind [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1878.5600000000002s)]
*  of go about my business in a in a in a loner way, which is fine. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1882.4s)]
*  I'm OK with that. And I love people. I think they're incredible. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1885.88s)]
*  I think the other artists in my genre and that are doing well, I absolutely love them. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1887.8400000000001s)]
*  But I oftentimes if I'm doing the thing like last night, I'm just like, I'll do it by [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1892.64s)]
*  myself. It'll be fine. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1895.7600000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, definitely. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1896.8000000000002s)]
*  Is it just and it's not really a choice that you don't want to work with other [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1897.88s)]
*  people. It's just kind of like this has been going fine. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1900.8s)]
*  This is how I'm doing. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1903.84s)]
*  Do you think you don't want to bother other people ever? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1905.24s)]
*  Yes, definitely. And I also I don't want to be kind of I don't want to seem as [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1907.76s)]
*  though I'm reaching out to somebody for their clout or whatever. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1913.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1915.6s)]
*  I don't think you could seem like that. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1916.6s)]
*  Nice one. Yeah, I appreciate it. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1918.08s)]
*  I'd be honest with you. I don't think just, you know, I don't know you super well. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1919.28s)]
*  We've gotten hung out a few times. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1922.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think that you could seem like that. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1924.52s)]
*  OK. Yeah. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1926.2s)]
*  It doesn't help anything. But no, no, no. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1927.6s)]
*  But you know, when you can work on with J. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1928.9199999999998s)]
*  Cole, but I think you easily could. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1930.32s)]
*  I mean, we went out the other night and Zach Brown saw you and he was like, I, you [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1933.32s)]
*  know, immediately he brought you on to his show. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1936.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Thank you for that. He said that immediately. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1938.96s)]
*  He didn't think at all. It was cool. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1940.6399999999999s)]
*  He just was like so excited to see you. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1942.32s)]
*  Yeah, we we randomly ran in and we're at the Red Clay Strays and yeah, there you [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1945.28s)]
*  are now. That's crazy. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1949.4399999999998s)]
*  I saw that video. It gave me chills, dude. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1950.84s)]
*  It was nuts. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1954.0s)]
*  We had it was funny. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1955.32s)]
*  I lingered for so long because we [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1956.36s)]
*  he said we rehearsed it beforehand and he was like, I'll sing the outro verse. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1959.36s)]
*  He said, you sing the first half of the outro verse, I'll sing the second half. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  I was like, perfect. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1965.52s)]
*  So I sang my bit, then went and hit away with the bongo player for a while. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1966.44s)]
*  And then the outro verse came along and I walked back out to the walkway and I was [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1970.28s)]
*  like, all right, sweet, here we go. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1974.56s)]
*  And then he started singing the outro verse. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1975.72s)]
*  I was like, oh, no, now I'm just standing here. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1977.08s)]
*  So into like being an awkward person, I was like, I'm just standing here in front [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1979.16s)]
*  of 70,000 people with nothing to do. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1982.52s)]
*  I should have been gone ages ago. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1984.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1986.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1987.8000000000002s)]
*  He was lovely, though. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1988.88s)]
*  God, that's so cool looking, dude. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1990.2800000000002s)]
*  It's nice. It's the best thing. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1992.44s)]
*  I don't get nervous for that, which is weird. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1994.24s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, man. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1996.5200000000002s)]
*  That karaoke makes me so sad. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=1997.68s)]
*  I could not even imagine having to sing in front of people. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2000.16s)]
*  So when did you start to learn that you had singing talent? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2004.4s)]
*  I mean, I know that some of this will be like elementary stuff to you. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2006.48s)]
*  But for some audience that doesn't know you, you know, so. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2009.5600000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2011.7600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. When did you start to learn that? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2013.08s)]
*  Because how do you go from being like this sort of like it like. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2014.4s)]
*  Like not recluse, but sort of this like quiet kid shadow lurking. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2018.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2023.92s)]
*  Good guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2025.64s)]
*  We don't want to make it sound like a villain. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2029.0s)]
*  No, but sort of this [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2030.4s)]
*  this guy who is this patient person. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  How do you go from that to like being able to like express yourself? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2035.56s)]
*  Because, dude, yeah, when you start, it's like there's a lot of levels to what you do. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2038.96s)]
*  Like sometimes I feel like there's like some Mac Miller. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2042.6399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like there's like this Dr. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2045.0s)]
*  Seuss of like Irish funerals going on. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2047.32s)]
*  There's so many. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2050.12s)]
*  And then sometimes it's just like this. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2051.64s)]
*  You almost feel like you're at a opera or something. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2053.88s)]
*  Right. You know, yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2056.88s)]
*  So it's really impressive. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2058.2s)]
*  Nice one, man. Thank you. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2059.64s)]
*  Yeah. I try and do a few different things. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2060.68s)]
*  But I remember my sister played piano and she still does when we were kids. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2062.08s)]
*  And classic thing, I would just sing in the back of the car. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2065.68s)]
*  And I remember my mom, I was just loud. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2067.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, I'm still loud. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2069.4s)]
*  And so, yeah, I just started figuring out. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2070.32s)]
*  I played soccer quite seriously when I was a kid, seriously in my head. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2072.6800000000003s)]
*  And so music was like a secondary thing. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  So I never worried about playing to people because I was thinking about playing football. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2079.6800000000003s)]
*  So I would always it came quite easy to me to play to people because I didn't see [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2083.32s)]
*  it as being that important the first few times, you know? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2089.1600000000003s)]
*  And so, yeah, it just gradually became a thing. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2091.52s)]
*  I started realizing I wanted to write music. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2094.2000000000003s)]
*  I go into town and like do open mics and stuff. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2096.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, you would? Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2098.1600000000003s)]
*  Like Dublin's so supportive. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2099.0400000000004s)]
*  That's what I mean. It's like I know I was talking about notions and all that kind of stuff, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2100.04s)]
*  but it's just like it's a nice place. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2103.2799999999997s)]
*  I was 15, 16 playing in these pubs and people would do anything to help you. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2105.72s)]
*  You know, I don't know what it's like. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2110.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2111.36s)]
*  No, that Irish will do anything. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2112.16s)]
*  Yeah. And they just if they see some potential in you, they're just going to say, I know this person, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2113.48s)]
*  I know that person, be careful with this and da da da and lots of advice and all that kind of thing. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2117.08s)]
*  So, yeah, just gradually. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2121.16s)]
*  I mean, like I'm 32 now. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2123.2s)]
*  So like I've been doing this since I was 19, I guess. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2124.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2129.16s)]
*  So it's a long road. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2129.84s)]
*  And I know we were talking about the Red Clays to Rays and how they've put time in. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2130.76s)]
*  And I think if you get to a certain level, there's very few people haven't had that journey. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2133.36s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2137.76s)]
*  I know you had Luke Combs on here. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2138.44s)]
*  I know everybody's got their journey in music, but like there's so much time you spend knowing you're good [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2139.7200000000003s)]
*  and being frustrated that you don't have a career. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2144.1200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2145.92s)]
*  So I think you just have to be patient. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2146.48s)]
*  It's so like it's so silly to me. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2149.0s)]
*  It's so kind of arbitrary in a way, because it's like it's this thing where you're like you said, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2150.8s)]
*  like you're lurking in the shadows knowing you're good and but no one's paying attention. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2157.6s)]
*  And then out of nowhere, people decide you're just really good. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2162.2s)]
*  And it's like, I knew that before. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2164.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2165.92s)]
*  But it just takes time. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2166.36s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2167.88s)]
*  That is such a fine line. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2168.56s)]
*  There's a like what's it like for you? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2170.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2172.2s)]
*  Like when you knew you had this potential, but we thought that I was funny. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2172.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I was sitting on a porch one day at school in college and this kid's like, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2177.2s)]
*  you should do stand up comedy, man. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2181.44s)]
*  And I was like, fuck you, dude. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2182.88s)]
*  You're an idiot. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2184.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2184.68s)]
*  And the guy was an idiot. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2185.04s)]
*  So I was right. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2186.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2187.7999999999997s)]
*  But but yeah, I eventually I started doing comedy, you know. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2188.08s)]
*  But was it that classic thing? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2193.92s)]
*  Yeah, there were times you start to do good. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2194.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2195.8799999999997s)]
*  And then you're like, why? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2196.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2197.6s)]
*  What? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2198.0s)]
*  You know, you see other people like I'm doing. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  But I think a lot of it's just time. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2200.72s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, like weathering that storm and then weathering that storm of like other [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2202.68s)]
*  people's careers have been going. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2210.16s)]
*  They have to have their successes. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2211.6s)]
*  And so that's just the way that time works. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2214.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you do you find that hard sometimes when you see people like having massive moments? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2216.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know you are, too. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2221.64s)]
*  So it's probably made easier by that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2222.8399999999997s)]
*  I definitely did earlier on, you know, and then now it's like, you know, we're able to [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2224.16s)]
*  sell out a club and able to sell out some spots. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2229.8399999999997s)]
*  So once you can kind of do that, you start to feel a little bit more like in control. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2231.68s)]
*  That like at least OK, at least I'm doing my job. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that's part of it, too. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2238.56s)]
*  It's like, hell, it's hard to admit to somebody that you're a comedian. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2239.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, because everybody's funny and everybody has good stories, especially [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2243.36s)]
*  being from Louisiana. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2247.32s)]
*  So like they don't even have any comedy clubs in Louisiana because people are so funny [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2248.84s)]
*  just talking to them. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2255.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2256.84s)]
*  So it's like, I'm not going to go pay seven dollars and go win that, you know, booze. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2257.5600000000004s)]
*  My friend is funnier than. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2262.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2263.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, fucking Randy out here. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2265.0400000000004s)]
*  Did you spend a lot of time sort of doing sets and clubs or just oh, yeah, tough ones? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2267.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for years, man. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2271.92s)]
*  Yeah, I would drive and do all the sets. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2273.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think there was a part of me that wanted to be good at it. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2275.52s)]
*  Of course. And then I think after a while, I think the art chooses you because I didn't [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2278.2000000000003s)]
*  end up getting married. I didn't have a child. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2284.0400000000004s)]
*  So those things didn't kind of like start to take up my time. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2286.0800000000004s)]
*  So I was still available for it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2289.76s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2291.4s)]
*  So, yeah, I think there's there's a moment kind of where some of the art chooses you. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2292.8s)]
*  I keep thinking about you spitting on that girl's head. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2297.44s)]
*  Oh, terrible times. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2299.5600000000004s)]
*  God, if she only knew and I tried to, I think, draw a heart when I spit or something. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2302.28s)]
*  I tried to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2305.84s)]
*  I tried to save it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2307.1200000000003s)]
*  I tried to do something. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2308.48s)]
*  You know, I remember just doing like that a little or something. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2309.36s)]
*  I I don't know. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2311.32s)]
*  I wanted to be kind of artistic. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2313.0400000000004s)]
*  I don't fucking do it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2314.6000000000004s)]
*  But it was that was the only way I could express myself. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2316.36s)]
*  I know what you mean about the saliva. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2320.0400000000004s)]
*  I find it even when I'm doing this, you know. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2321.5600000000004s)]
*  So I don't know, man. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2328.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we're we talking about. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2331.88s)]
*  But it's been good. I love being here, honestly. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2333.0s)]
*  Have you? It's a good place making music. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2335.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good place. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2336.76s)]
*  Definitely. I think. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2337.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And I think if you don't you have to kind of like put yourself out there some here. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2339.1200000000003s)]
*  And if you like to do kind of your own thing, your music does feel very. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2342.76s)]
*  Important to you, like you said, right? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2348.92s)]
*  Like the stuff you're you know, you're not trying to go for like it doesn't seem like [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2350.84s)]
*  some pop thing or trying to like read a bunch of other people's songs that they've written. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2356.28s)]
*  No, it seems like you're trying to make your your voice. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2360.8s)]
*  Yeah. If it was like someone else, you know, there'd be no point. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2364.0s)]
*  There's people I'm a fan of and there's people I'm inspired by. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2366.84s)]
*  But you've got to take a mix of all that and make your own thing. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2368.84s)]
*  Yeah. Otherwise, it's boring. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2370.96s)]
*  Because that's a big part of the culture here is like all the big songwriter groups. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2372.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then they service the musicians, you know. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2375.1600000000003s)]
*  Totally. And you got to be careful because you find like I've written songs where I'm like, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2377.44s)]
*  oh, no, that's too like this person. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2381.32s)]
*  There's no place in the world for that. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2382.6400000000003s)]
*  I think it's funny. Sometimes you'll have people kind of. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2384.44s)]
*  So I remember we were talking about Lewis Capaldi the other day. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2388.44s)]
*  I remember for. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2390.44s)]
*  For a long time, I was kind of pushing to do just piano and vocal and it never really worked out. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2393.0800000000004s)]
*  And then he had his massive song. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2398.6800000000003s)]
*  I was getting kind of used to being someone you loved. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2402.88s)]
*  And then I remember someone in my team that I worked with was kind of like, oh, I was thinking like maybe piano and vocal. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  And I was like, this is so obvious. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2409.76s)]
*  Like he did that already. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2411.0s)]
*  So like it's so senseless that I would go and do that unless it felt right. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2412.5600000000004s)]
*  But this idea of just like copying something else that did well is weird. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2415.96s)]
*  And we'll never get the right results, I think. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2420.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you see a lot of that with music. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2422.96s)]
*  You see like someone breaks out of the pack. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2425.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And then there's a lot of other people that start to sound just like them. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2429.28s)]
*  Oh, totally. You see it now, like St. Noah Cannon, like Brian, like having these huge moments. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2432.4s)]
*  I'm inspired by it, but I have to make sure I do my own thing and don't sort of what's the word, try and replicate it, I guess. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2436.6s)]
*  Yeah. Because you'll just end up on your ass. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2441.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think. Yeah, because then you're just like, oh, he sounds like this person. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2444.28s)]
*  Totally. And the reason it works for them is because they are them and they're uniquely them. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2448.0s)]
*  And people are drawn to that, definitely. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2452.2s)]
*  I think even like the attitude that's contained within your music, like you see Zach Brian, like the recordings and everything, they're quite, what's the word? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2453.84s)]
*  Like they're so rough and ready, but people are drawn to that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2461.68s)]
*  Everything's so perfect nowadays. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2464.64s)]
*  So people just like that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2466.12s)]
*  If he's literally just pressing record and that take is that take. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2467.08s)]
*  I think it's incredible. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2470.72s)]
*  Again, I heard Luke Combs kind of say they'll go in and do five songs in an evening. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2471.76s)]
*  I think that's beautiful. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2476.44s)]
*  I've been in situations now where things can get quite fragmented and you're kind of like, OK, we'll do piano, then do vocal. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2477.28s)]
*  It's all quite polished and put together. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2485.0400000000004s)]
*  So I want to get back to that side of things. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2486.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that feels like a challenge. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2488.44s)]
*  I think it's a challenge in any art. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2491.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, how do I stay me? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2493.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And then how do I stay me as I change? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2495.6000000000004s)]
*  And then am I is it OK to still be me? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2500.28s)]
*  This changed me at the risk of that. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2505.24s)]
*  My the people who are paying attention to me won't will understand. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2508.64s)]
*  Totally. And I like I get to hide behind the music like in your line of work. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2513.3199999999997s)]
*  I think you are your brand. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2516.64s)]
*  Right. So like changing has got to be a whole different thing. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2519.2s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2521.4399999999996s)]
*  Like I can change my music all I like and I'll still be me underneath it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2522.04s)]
*  But like I find for comedians or people that do what you do, it's tough because because your name is the whole thing. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2525.04s)]
*  Right. You know, like like if you change your name, you're going to be like, OK, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2531.8399999999997s)]
*  if you change as a person, people will kind of could criticize, could enjoy it, whatever. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2534.64s)]
*  Yeah. But to not even evolve, I think. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2538.48s)]
*  Right. Like I think that's kind of the thing that I'm thinking of is like like a guy told me one time he's a manager. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2541.12s)]
*  He's worked at a fancy management company in Los Angeles. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2548.24s)]
*  And he said, you know, your audience will grow up with you. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2552.56s)]
*  So you have to grow up as well or it can get kind of stale. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2555.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, and I thought that was just interesting. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2560.8799999999997s)]
*  Just like, yeah, that's kind of true. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2563.92s)]
*  Like if I, you know, be afraid to change or don't grow up or, you know, then they're going to grow up past me. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2565.92s)]
*  Of course. Yeah, I got that with music, too. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2574.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, you try and like you try and sort of think about what age you were when people first started listening to your music and then change with that 50 Cent's a Good Example. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2576.5600000000004s)]
*  He always he stopped making music sometimes because he was just like, it's not relevant to those people anymore. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2584.48s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2589.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2591.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's some like there's a little bit of Zach Brian. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2592.8s)]
*  I want to hear there's a little bit of James Blake, but there's it's you. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2594.8s)]
*  It definitely felt like this guy at the shipyard who's just going to fucking show you what's going on. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2597.76s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2605.52s)]
*  You know, I hope so. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2606.88s)]
*  My voice is blown out. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2607.84s)]
*  Girl, she better pay attention. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2608.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2611.12s)]
*  Like that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2612.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's stories. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2613.2000000000003s)]
*  And if he goes out on the boat with you to fish or crab or whatever, he's going to be a little loud sometimes. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2614.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2620.4s)]
*  I got told I even talk too loud. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2621.28s)]
*  A speech therapist recently was like, you need to relax constantly. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2622.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2625.92s)]
*  Yeah, they said like because I have trouble with my voice sometimes. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2626.5600000000004s)]
*  Even last night, my voice kind of went about halfway through and I don't know how to not go full beans constantly. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2628.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2635.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, you must get so many dude. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2636.2400000000002s)]
*  Every girl I know, my brother's wife, my ex girlfriend, they every woman is looking for you. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2638.7200000000003s)]
*  So I don't know if you I'm sure you have how many ring cameras do you have? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2647.68s)]
*  Here we got the cameras on those at home. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2652.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2655.04s)]
*  Nah, it's just people can connect to real feelings. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2656.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's okay. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2659.9199999999996s)]
*  I saw you. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2661.12s)]
*  You were nodding along. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I was. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2662.72s)]
*  I had one song that had rhythm in it last night. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2663.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2666.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, no, there was a couple moments you hit some. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2667.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2669.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, yeah, when it's not like the whole band and it's just you, that's a lot of pressure. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2669.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, you had the you had the boys with you there. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2673.52s)]
*  The poet Joshua. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2676.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was great. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2677.28s)]
*  Dude, he was at my show in Halifax. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2678.4s)]
*  I'll tell you that was he at the show. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2679.76s)]
*  Yeah, because he said he bumped into you on the flight. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2681.44s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know he was at the show. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2682.8s)]
*  Yeah, he came to the show in Halifax in the morning. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2683.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm on the plane. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2685.44s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2686.2400000000002s)]
*  He said, hey, I was at your show last night. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2686.7200000000003s)]
*  I was like, oh, you're heading to the US. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2687.84s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I'm going to play with Dermot Kennedy. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2689.28s)]
*  I said, oh, I'm actually going to his show. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2691.2000000000003s)]
*  And so I'll see you there tomorrow. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2693.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's a nice guy. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2694.96s)]
*  He was so much more confident than me. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2695.84s)]
*  He he was funny. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2697.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's 22 as well. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2699.76s)]
*  So it's just like, I don't know, I think I think that's a difficult gig when it's just spoken, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2701.52s)]
*  you know, the music you can hide behind it and stuff. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2707.36s)]
*  But when it's just spoken word, that's not easy. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2709.2s)]
*  Yeah, but it added this element of like, because last night, so just for the listeners, so there [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2711.04s)]
*  was Dermot, there was Gabe Simon accompanying him on guitar and mandolin and some different [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2716.4s)]
*  instruments. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2721.6s)]
*  And there was Joshua de Schutter, and he's a poet, and he was like kind of reading lines at certain [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2722.56s)]
*  points. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2732.96s)]
*  Yeah, and he had sort of tailored his poetry to fit around the songs. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2733.44s)]
*  It was just cool. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2736.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2737.52s)]
*  Like, I was cool. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2737.84s)]
*  I know when I was that age, I kind of was dying to do things like that. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2738.72s)]
*  So I was excited to work with him. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2741.36s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that was super cool. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2742.8s)]
*  How did you find him? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2743.92s)]
*  Instagram. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2745.68s)]
*  I saw him doing it. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2746.32s)]
*  He had a really cool poem. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2746.96s)]
*  I couldn't even point it out now, but he had a really cool poem about [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2748.72s)]
*  two people who every night in a cemetery, they come up out of the graves, and one guy was really [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2751.8399999999997s)]
*  rich and one guy was really poor. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2755.68s)]
*  And just it's this beautiful poem about like, not forgetting what's important in life. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2756.96s)]
*  So I thought it was cool. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2762.16s)]
*  I think there's a lot of bullshit poetry on Instagram, and I think he's not that. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2763.04s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2767.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2767.68s)]
*  Yeah, I liked even just having a younger person, it like added this element of like, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2768.48s)]
*  nervous energy and approach to the world, which was like such a dichotomy to kind of some of your [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2773.12s)]
*  music, you know, some of it's like, you know, it's more like, I don't think a young person [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2778.4s)]
*  could even write something, you know, you know, I think you have to have some experience, you know. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2783.6800000000003s)]
*  I definitely think about that now, even like having any degree of success. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2787.84s)]
*  I feel better equipped now. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2791.12s)]
*  You know, I used to be annoyed that I wasn't getting gigs and stuff, but [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2793.04s)]
*  I guess I'm glad it happened the way it did because now I even as a person just in society, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2797.12s)]
*  I try not to, you know, you learn how to not take shit from people and you learn who you are in the [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2802.32s)]
*  world a little bit. I'd be scared if I was 22 doing this, you know what I mean? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2807.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, having like a lot of success at that age. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2810.4s)]
*  Any kind of traction. Yeah. And someone was like, I feel like I'm easily led or gullible even at [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2813.2799999999997s)]
*  this age. So I don't know what I'd be like if I was younger. Yeah. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2818.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It seemed kind of risque out there. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2820.48s)]
*  I want to think more about Ireland, dude. Do they have, oh, somebody said the Irish [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2824.08s)]
*  started Halloween. Is that true? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2827.84s)]
*  Sound? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because what is it? It sort of translates like the [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2830.0s)]
*  the night of the lost souls or something like that. I'm not sure, but yeah, Irish people, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2834.48s)]
*  Ireland's very pagan and sort of a lot of things like that. The dead are very important. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2838.48s)]
*  The dead are very important. You know the way like Coco, like, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2843.6800000000003s)]
*  in those movies, like it's like, that's the Mexican dead, right? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2847.28s)]
*  Yeah. It feels like the similarities in that sense. There's like the Celtic sound festival. Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2849.6s)]
*  Wow. My, actually, I was talking about it last night, the gig, the island my auntie lives on, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2855.04s)]
*  Halloween's really important and it's all the lost souls and stuff. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2860.88s)]
*  What is it called? Inishmore. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2863.84s)]
*  Inishmore. I thought her name's Deirdre. I thought you were about to say her name. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2865.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like, you know my auntie Deirdre. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2867.92s)]
*  But they have these traditions, you know, where there's very few people live on the [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2872.56s)]
*  island. It's like, I'd be bullshit, maybe a few hundred people kind of thing. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2876.4s)]
*  And there's this tradition where someone, someone you know will knock on your door and they're kind [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2882.0s)]
*  of allowed walk around your house in silence and open drawers and closed drawers and, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2887.92s)]
*  and then leave. And then later on everyone's in the pub and you don't know who is in your house. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2892.88s)]
*  So it's just kind of, there's all these creepy traditions. Yeah. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2897.52s)]
*  Oh, that's fun. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2899.92s)]
*  But Ireland started Halloween. Yeah. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2900.4s)]
*  Oh, that's guessing. Yeah. Halloween was invented in Ireland. The roots of Halloween can be traced [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2902.0s)]
*  back 2000 years to the Celtic Samhain. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2905.6s)]
*  Samhain. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2908.4s)]
*  Samhain festival. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2909.36s)]
*  Yeah. I think those things are important in Ireland, like ghosts and all that kind of thing. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2909.76s)]
*  Do you believe in ghosts? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2913.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, for sure, dude. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2913.76s)]
*  From Louisiana, we got fucking ghosts over there. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2916.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, true. Yeah. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2918.64s)]
*  Everybody's, yeah. Everybody's eating trout or something, you know, even you'll hear a ghost [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2919.3599999999997s)]
*  eating something. Like a lot of, we have fat ghosts down there. Like you'll be at the hospital [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2924.16s)]
*  and be like, yeah, there's a ghost in the other. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2930.16s)]
*  The other ward. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2932.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. He broke his legs. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2933.2s)]
*  New Orleans is Louisiana, right? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2936.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2938.24s)]
*  Ghosts are like, that's a ghost town, right? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2938.64s)]
*  It's a ghost town. Yeah. There's ghost tours. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2940.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And the crazy thing, you'll be on a ghost tour, somebody will get murdered because it's [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2943.52s)]
*  so dangerous there. Then another ghost will show up. You're like, oh damn, that's Reginald. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2946.48s)]
*  Yeah. I knew him. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2952.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. They just, he just got here. He's fresh. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2953.52s)]
*  But yeah, there's a lot of like that sort of energy there. There's tons of ghost tours [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2957.92s)]
*  and stuff like that. We had a dude in our town who got busted by the cops for being a ghost, dude. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2961.52s)]
*  So this family owned, they bought like a Ramada and it was like a small, it's a small motel. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2968.8s)]
*  And it used to be nice and now it's still nice, but it's not like, it's not like swanky. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2977.76s)]
*  And they were trying to make it on the, get on the, on the ghost tour. So when people came to [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2983.28s)]
*  America to go learn about ghosts and everything, it would show up on like the ghost, like, oh, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2989.44s)]
*  you got to stop here, right? So they wanted to make it haunted. So they did like some like, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2993.36s)]
*  low key, haughty shit, like the wiring and stuff. And it was getting a little bit of a buzz, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=2999.2s)]
*  but then they're like, oh, we're not getting enough people that love ghosts, you know? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3004.08s)]
*  And so they would have somebody would dress up upstairs and they had hotel room doors that were [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3008.08s)]
*  across the hallway from each other. So they would open a door on each side. And when you go walked [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3014.24s)]
*  up the stairs, the person would just walk across. So you'd see something like just, what was that? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3018.64s)]
*  And yeah. And so it was getting some heat and people were like, holy shit, there's ghosts. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3025.6s)]
*  And people were outside fucking hanging out and drinking Dr. Pepper and fucking sometimes even [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3030.08s)]
*  people, because they're people get real excited. And then they busted the guy, the guy forgot to [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3035.12s)]
*  take off his ghost sheet or whatever. He was driving home and was like the owner's son. And [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3040.56s)]
*  they fucking busted him. Yeah. Have you had any like encounters properly with ghosts? Oh yeah. A [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3044.72s)]
*  friend of mine died and like I was laying in his living room the day after and I felt him. He was [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3052.08s)]
*  right outside. Wow. No way. And I just, it felt as if he was right there. I mean, it just, I don't [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  know. I never felt like he was standing around me before or since, but it just felt real. And I just [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3062.96s)]
*  started like crying. It was like just super intense, you know? Wow. I've never had, I believe in all [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3067.84s)]
*  that stuff so strongly, but never anything like that. Yeah. Ireland, you guys have like the Giants [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3072.72s)]
*  Causeway? Causeway. Yeah. And it's supposedly made by Giants. Yeah. But did you go there? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3077.52s)]
*  Did we go to Giants Causeway? We didn't. No, I haven't been there. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3083.36s)]
*  But is that good? Is that helpful? But it's like, but the story is that [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3087.04s)]
*  there was a giant from there and a giant from Scotland and they weren't getting along. Is that [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3094.56s)]
*  right? I feel like you know more about it than I do. Yeah, I think so. Oh, Finn McCool. That was [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3098.08s)]
*  one of the Giants. And there was another giant. Legend has it that an Irish giant named Finn [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3102.08s)]
*  McCool created and everybody's going to think this is extremely exciting. Yeah. An Irish giant, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3107.52s)]
*  Finn McCool, yeah, to cross the Irish sea and fight his rival, the Scottish giant Ben and Donner. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So they like, and so it just looks like these like, there's these big square [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3120.24s)]
*  stones heading out into the water from each side. Yeah. Beautiful thing. So there's one of them [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3127.2s)]
*  in Scotland as well. That's a good question. Hopefully there is. If not, you made it up. Yeah. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3131.04s)]
*  Fuck it. Scotland Giants Causeway. We'll say that there is. Let's keep the lore alive. But yeah, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3136.8s)]
*  there's a lot of stuff like that in Ireland. Like a lot of like, well, there's leprechauns, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3145.84s)]
*  there's mystery, you know, ancient things. Yeah. A lot of that. There's a lot of like, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3149.68s)]
*  lore. Definitely. Absolutely. There's a lot of myths and stuff. It's kind of, it's romantic in a way. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3155.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I think like I love Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and all that stuff purely because [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3160.64s)]
*  I think being Irish, you kind of grow up loving those things. Yeah. Definitely. I would hate to [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3164.48s)]
*  be without that. I think to be honest, like I, in my songs, like I had a song last night because [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3168.48s)]
*  called The Killer Was a Coward and it's just made up story. I love it. It's just about a king and [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3173.92s)]
*  a person that kind of like finds his way through this castle and kills him. And to me, I was just [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3178.96s)]
*  like, fuck it. Why not make a song like that? Yeah. What is the songwriting experience been like in [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3183.92s)]
*  Nashville? Has it been inspired by like any like country vibes or is like, is it just, this is a [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3190.08s)]
*  place that you feel is good to write and be? I think it's a good place. You know, like I think [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3195.68s)]
*  you can't downplay how talented people are. Sometimes if I'm writing somewhere else, I can [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3199.84s)]
*  get stuck and kind of come away with like half a verse or half a chorus or something. Whereas here [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3204.7999999999997s)]
*  you come away with full songs because people do not stop. It's like Gabe, who was there last night, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3208.88s)]
*  he just, he's relentless. You know what I mean? He can kind of just, he never runs out of ideas. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3212.96s)]
*  So people here are just so talented. Plus it's just a better place to write. Yeah. I don't know. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3217.92s)]
*  I like being here. It feels like it's not the be all and end all the music business, even though [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3223.12s)]
*  it's here and it's based here. And there's so many people here that are working on music. It doesn't [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3228.0s)]
*  feel like people are writing to try and be successful. It feels like people are trying to [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3232.32s)]
*  just make music and see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. There's a nice sense of like just being [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3235.92s)]
*  alive here. Definitely. And you just take time and people are nice and you'd be playing a song and [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3240.32s)]
*  someone will kind of invite their friend over and play guitar. Whereas in LA, that'd be kind of like [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3245.12s)]
*  what's in for me. Why would I do that? You know what I mean? Whereas here it's just supportive. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3248.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's really true, man. I mean, we went out and saw some great music and [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3252.3199999999997s)]
*  then you met up with Zach Brown and you're playing with, yeah, I think it's definitely people, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3256.64s)]
*  it's more of a sharing culture here for sure. And it, yeah, it feels like it's, it's its own place [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3261.52s)]
*  outside of just the possibility of making music. Totally. I think sometimes when I write, I [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3267.2799999999997s)]
*  question how important it is. Do you know what I mean? That's why, like I've had moments in the [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3274.8799999999997s)]
*  past where I struggle with getting music over the line because I'm just like, who cares? And I [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3279.04s)]
*  completely forget about the fact that people listen to it. You know what I mean? I kind of, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3284.0s)]
*  I have dismissed that and I don't mean who cares. Like it's always important to me, but also [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3288.16s)]
*  in the past, I've kind of been like, oh, I don't know. You get so caught up in it. You're just like, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3293.3599999999997s)]
*  does it really matter? Really? Like, and, and, and I don't know. Yeah. So it's nice to be back [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3297.2799999999997s)]
*  at a place where music is the most important thing. It's lovely. I think when you kind of go [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3302.96s)]
*  chasing a career, it can be a tricky thing and it can get in the way of doing the right stuff [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3306.64s)]
*  creatively. So I'm glad to be here. Oh yeah. That's a good point. Yeah. Well, do you feel like, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3310.0s)]
*  I mean, you've had such a great career already. Do you feel like, yeah, does it, does a new [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3313.84s)]
*  like desire arise in you once you're already doing well kind of, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3321.12s)]
*  is it like a maintaining desire? Is it? No, I think it's a returning, for me, it's returning [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3325.36s)]
*  to who I was before doing any of it. You know what I mean? Like you being funny on the porch, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3333.52s)]
*  cause it just makes you feel good. You know what I mean? Me playing music at home, just cause it's [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3337.44s)]
*  the thing I love. I have yet to play a show where I come away being like, oh wow, that was perfect. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3342.0s)]
*  I'm so happy now. Do you know what I mean? Like when I'm on the tour bus after a gig, like I keep [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3347.76s)]
*  an even keel constantly. I don't come off stage wired or I don't come off stage really sad. I just [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3352.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of like, yeah, it was good. And if it was good, I'm happy with it. And if it was bad, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3357.9199999999996s)]
*  it's okay, cause I'll do it again tomorrow. But yeah, like getting back, I said that last night, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3360.7999999999997s)]
*  like I want to be able to play music like I don't care. Do you know what I mean? I just, there's no [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3366.7999999999997s)]
*  thought about like whether it's good or bad. I'm just doing it cause it feels right. Yeah. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3372.08s)]
*  Like I blow my voice out cause I'm just trying so fucking hard all the time. Do you know what I mean? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3376.56s)]
*  I need to get to a place where I don't feel very confident doing it. You know what I mean? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3380.4s)]
*  Not at all. Doing what? Just performing for people. Like I, I self-analyze constantly [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3384.08s)]
*  to the point that it's detrimental. But then I like, I think a lot of musicians do that, right? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3390.48s)]
*  Like you're hard on yourself, you're hard on yourself. You want to do your best. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3396.1600000000003s)]
*  Totally. Yeah. That's part, that's something I got out of your stuff too. It's like, I felt like, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3399.6800000000003s)]
*  I felt like am I, I want to give everything that I'm capable of while I'm here. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3405.4399999999996s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, of course. Yeah. It's only last night. Like you talked about- [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3412.7999999999997s)]
*  While I exist even, while I exist, I want to get everything that is possible out of me. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3416.16s)]
*  Definitely. You know, like having played sport for such a long time when I was a kid, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3423.6s)]
*  that felt like such a powerful feeling. And I think sometimes I'm trying to get that feeling [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3428.08s)]

*  Is that like a latchkey kid in Ireland? The term refrigerator mother was coined by Austrian physicist [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3948.0s)]
*  Leo Kanner in the 1940s to describe a mother whose cold uncaring style so traumatized her child [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3952.4s)]
*  that they were treated into autism. So they thought maybe if he was left-handed, he was autistic. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3957.36s)]
*  We had a fellow with Down syndrome in our town and his mom just thought he was Irish his whole life. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3962.64s)]
*  And it was just crazy, man. Yeah. And he might've been actually, he would dress him up in all these [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3970.8s)]
*  Boston Celtics shit all the time. Oh, it's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Just different. Yeah. Different, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3974.8s)]

*  and he called me a leprechaun within five minutes. I had never met him before and he called me a [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3984.7999999999997s)]
*  leprechaun. It's terrible. Yeah. He was kind of outgoing like that. Yeah, he was. Yeah. He kind of, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3989.3599999999997s)]
*  he had a couple of pops. Oh, do people get married young in Ireland? What's that like? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=3994.0s)]
*  Not so much. I don't know. What's it like here? I feel like it used to be, but not anymore. Yeah. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4000.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Like I would say thirties, early thirties, maybe nowadays. I know my parents got married [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4005.44s)]
*  when they were like 23, so I was just gradually growing up. Yeah. I guess I just wonder like how [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4012.32s)]
*  the cultures are super different. Oh yeah. In a lot of ways I'd imagine. I mean, that guy, Joshua, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4016.16s)]
*  the poet last night, he couldn't drink. He was 20 years old. I mean, in Ireland, that is not the [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4023.28s)]
*  case. People can drink that early, eh? Well, 18, but you know. Well, they let him in the pubs as well, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4027.28s)]
*  some. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Especially down the country. Like after the road ball and everyone's getting [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4032.56s)]
*  in, I'd imagine it. Yeah, dude. Yeah. Cork was something else. I couldn't even believe when we [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4036.7999999999997s)]
*  got there. I was like, this is so wild. You played the marquee too. That's great. Yeah. And the tent [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4041.04s)]
*  there. I played there one time. Yeah. It was, it was totally different. The acoustics were a little [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4044.7999999999997s)]
*  bit different in there. Do you have to change your set on in a cultural way? Probably not. Right. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4049.92s)]
*  Oh, I tell, I learned stuff about like Belfast when I first got there. Yeah. Like the NRA, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4054.4s)]
*  the IRA. Yeah. And the IRA. Yeah. Yes. And we learned about the IRA and like, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4060.64s)]
*  yeah, like, ooh, up the raw. We learned about that. Yeah. And then we learned fuck England was the [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4067.52s)]
*  big thing. We were saying you could just lean on that whenever you want to do things got bad. Yeah. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4072.96s)]
*  You just yell it out. Yes. People go, some guy pulled out a sword. I'm like, who has a sword? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4076.32s)]
*  And I think he worked there. Yeah. Well, that seems it's just security. Yeah. He's a bit out [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4082.08s)]
*  of sorts, but yeah. Yeah. Is pornography causing a problem in your life? That's a good question. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4087.84s)]
*  It's a real question. It has in mind. It has at certain periods in my life, uh, watching porno [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4094.7200000000003s)]
*  and everything and watching porno was making me, it was ruining my life. It was ruining my life, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4102.56s)]
*  man. Made me feel just so much shame. That's what it did. Well, I'm watching pornography has become [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4108.08s)]
*  commonplace today. And oftentimes men will use porno to numb the pain of loneliness, boredom, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4114.32s)]
*  anxiety, and depression. That's all I want to introduce you to my friend, Steven Wolt. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4121.759999999999s)]

*  Thank you. What are some musicians that you really admire? I know that's kind of like... [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4191.44s)]
*  No, no, no. Hosea is a big one for me. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4195.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He's playing here coming up at the Pilgrimage Festival. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4197.12s)]
*  Oh, I saw that. Yeah. I was sad because I'll be gone. But he... Yeah, he just... [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4200.32s)]
*  He's Irish? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4205.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4206.4s)]
*  Yeah. I think sometimes people don't know that. I think I remember someone, I was talking to [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4207.599999999999s)]
*  someone recently, they thought he was from here, but he... It's just cool. He kind of blew up way [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4211.919999999999s)]
*  before me. And it's just a nice to see... It's kind of a cool role model to have. He just carries [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4218.080000000001s)]
*  himself very well, I think. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4224.88s)]
*  Will you keep in touch or hit him up if you have any thoughts or something? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4225.92s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. Not even thoughts, but just to talk. I think artists don't talk to each other [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4228.96s)]
*  enough. I find it hard to talk to other artists sometimes because I feel like it's very... [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4232.0s)]
*  We're all quite selfish and we're all so locked into our own existence that it's tricky sometimes. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4236.160000000001s)]
*  I find it much easier to connect with people who are involved in the music industry. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4241.120000000001s)]
*  I think that's easier sometimes, but he's... I don't know, it's just cool for me to see him. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  He's got this huge career where he's got so many followers and supporters of his music, but [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4249.76s)]
*  it's always just about the music. You know what I mean? It's just he's inherently him, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4255.599999999999s)]
*  and I think that's a pretty cool thing. It's good for me to kind of just see that and follow it. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4258.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4263.44s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4264.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of some other Irish musicians. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4264.64s)]
*  You two are obviously probably the biggest ever, but... [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4268.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4270.08s)]
*  Of course. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4271.12s)]
*  Dude, one time I went to the MTV Movie Awards or something. It might have been Music Awards. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4271.62s)]
*  I think it was Music Awards actually. I got dropped off there. I'm walking up, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4278.26s)]
*  and all these people start cheering, right? I got a pass, through the artist pass, whatever. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4282.66s)]
*  I'm walking up, all these people are cheering, and I just in my head, I was like, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4288.26s)]
*  these people are cheering for me? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4291.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4292.42s)]
*  I was like, what? Then I looked next to me and it was Bono. He's like, what? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4292.98s)]
*  I was like, what? Then I looked next to me and it was Bono. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4297.94s)]
*  Bono? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4301.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4302.099999999999s)]
*  Who are you talking to? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4302.42s)]
*  I said, nice glasses. That's what I said. Because I didn't know who he was. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4304.0199999999995s)]
*  At the time, I was just kind of like, I was 19, and I was like, I didn't have a clue. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4308.82s)]
*  He's the best. You know, sometimes when you're talking to somebody that's [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4312.42s)]
*  so famous and has been for such a long time, you kind of feel like you're not getting it. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4317.0599999999995s)]
*  There's nothing beneath the surface. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4320.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4322.34s)]
*  With him, it's the complete opposite. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4323.219999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4324.66s)]
*  You can tell. If you were talking to me, it's just full, undivided attention. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4324.98s)]
*  Oh, it's so cool. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4328.0199999999995s)]

*  Did you ever struggle with any of the gear or whatever they call it over there? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4406.58s)]
*  Nah, man. I find it... I don't know. Again, not to harp on about it, but I think sport was crucial [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4409.62s)]
*  for me. It was just kind of... I always... Like a tour, when I tour, I'll often do kind of... I feel [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4415.38s)]
*  like it's not sustainable nowadays in music. It was different back then. I don't know how heavily [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4421.86s)]
*  they toured and stuff, but nowadays touring is so key. I don't know. Personally, I wouldn't be able [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4425.62s)]
*  to sustain it at all. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4430.42s)]
*  No. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4431.38s)]

*  Even drinking, I've got to be careful. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4432.18s)]
*  Yeah. I just think it'd just be impossible to be hung. And then to the response, what is getting [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4434.42s)]
*  to the next place? It just seems like... [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4438.34s)]
*  It's not worth it yet. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4440.66s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know how people do it. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4442.02s)]
*  No, I know. Yeah. Sometimes... I don't know how some artists do it, but I wouldn't be able. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4444.18s)]
*  Even last night. I'm tired today from just playing an acoustic set in a cafe last night. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4450.66s)]
*  I'm very pedestrian. Definitely. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4453.860000000001s)]
*  What about the love life, man? How does that look for you? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4457.38s)]

*  Do people know that? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4471.78s)]
*  That's my experience. Yeah, kind of. I don't talk about it much, but I think if people wanted to [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4472.339999999999s)]
*  know, they would know. Yeah. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4477.0599999999995s)]

*  career. Do you know what I mean? I don't see it as something to promote. She definitely doesn't. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4486.58s)]
*  So it's just our existence outside of my career. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4490.98s)]
*  Does it feel... Does that inspire some of your music with some of the emo stuff or no? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4494.58s)]
*  What do you mean the emo stuff? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4499.94s)]
*  Like some of the loving type stuff. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4501.14s)]
*  Definitely. All of it. All of it. That's where it all comes from. And yeah, yeah. I never talk [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4502.82s)]

*  Yeah, dude. I've had it like... Yeah, I mean, I date, you know, it's just hard. You're in town, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4536.98s)]

*  like, oh, well, I had so much trouble staying in relationships and being committed in relationships. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4549.7s)]

*  how to do it. Yeah. It was like a foreign practice. Trusting somebody. Yeah. Really? Anybody? Only [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4593.3s)]
*  romantically? Friends? Oh, no, it even goes over into work and everything a lot of times. Right. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4601.219999999999s)]

*  I think it's just a tough go of it. Yeah, of course. Um, do you own any animals, Dermot? I have a dog [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4635.54s)]

*  Yeah. And this one right here is not anything, but I'll read it. B-L-A-T-H-N-A-I-D. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4975.38s)]
*  Blot. Blottenide. Blot. Blottenide. Blottenide. Blottenide. Yeah, you're doing all right. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4984.82s)]
*  All right. Here's one right here. C-A-O-I-L-F-H-I-O-N-N. Kevin. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=4992.66s)]
*  That one is even weird for me. I would say, I would say Quailin. Quailin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5003.62s)]
*  There's just everybody you meet over there. You're like, I'm Quailin Madonna Gargay, you know. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5008.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But I see that here too. Oh, yes. You know what I mean? Everyone. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5013.0599999999995s)]
*  I was in the boot barn last weekend and there was a guy called Loughlin. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5017.22s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And he was like, I'm Irish. You know, he just claims it, but doesn't know. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5021.54s)]
*  You're like, no shit. Yeah. What about the new album? So are you working on a new album? What [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5025.0599999999995s)]
*  is it like for you right now? Yes, I am. I have written, I would say, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5030.9s)]
*  25 to 30 songs. Wow. Yeah, but it goes crazy. It's kind of like, you can do as many as you want. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5038.66s)]
*  You can do hundreds. And like, I know, do you remember that song that Rihanna had? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5044.34s)]
*  I want you to stay. Not really sure how I feel about it. That song. No, I was with the fella [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5049.14s)]
*  that featured on that song and huge success. And then the second album, he wrote 250 songs. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5056.1s)]
*  So it's just like, at what point do you kind of call it? You know what I mean? And then I've [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5061.9400000000005s)]
*  heard Billy Irish do interviews where she says, if the album is 12 songs, I've written 12 songs and [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5065.46s)]
*  that's it. So I'd rather be like that. It's crazy to me, the idea of throwing songs out, you know, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5070.1s)]
*  I don't know why I would do that. So I got a bunch now and I feel good about them. I never know. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5074.34s)]
*  That's what I'm saying is like, I analyze myself too much and I think sometimes I lose perspective [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5078.900000000001s)]
*  and I could have the best song in the world, but I can't see it, you know? And do you, is there [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5083.14s)]
*  certain people you go to to get really clear perspective? No, no, I don't play music to anyone. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5086.58s)]
*  Anybody. Yeah. Cause if it's good feedback, I'll be like, yeah, I know. And if it's bad, then I'll be [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5092.42s)]
*  Wow. So what about a management or an agent or anything? Yes, some of that. But then [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5099.54s)]
*  that's hard too, right? Because you kind of question like, what are people's criteria? You [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5103.14s)]
*  know, to me, I only care that it's good, but then they might be like, oh, this song could be [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5109.3s)]
*  successful. And it's like, what does that mean? Right. You know, it could stink, but it could, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5112.660000000001s)]
*  like it could send me down the wrong path musically, but it could make money on the radio. I don't know. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5117.38s)]
*  So you got to do the right thing. And do you, will you choose a certain number out of those? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5122.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I like 10. I know, like I've seen like Morgan Wallen's album with like 37 songs and stuff. I don't [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5128.5s)]
*  know if I'm able for that kind of thing. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, different people have different [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5136.1s)]
*  stuff. Definitely. Hmm. Yeah. I wonder like, yeah, would I be scared? God, it's just got to be so [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5140.5s)]
*  scary putting an album out. It's going to define your life for two or three years, you know? It's [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5147.9400000000005s)]
*  almost like throwing a stick of dynamite into a room or something. Definitely. And then what if [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5153.3s)]
*  you don't hear anything? It may not go off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. You never know. I think [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5156.98s)]
*  like, yeah, that definitely scares me sometimes. And it might not happen. You know, what's almost [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5161.94s)]
*  even worse is that middle of the road kind of just like some people like boring. Yeah. For me, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5168.419999999999s)]
*  what's funny is like, I've never had a song go crazy. Do you know what I mean? Like I've never [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5173.62s)]
*  had a song like I play big venues in most places, but like I can walk around all day and no one [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5177.299999999999s)]
*  knows who I am. So I think I kind of exist in a sweet spot to some degree. You know what I mean? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5185.94s)]
*  Yeah. I think for me, it's like a careful what I wish for scenario sometimes because my life is [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5190.259999999999s)]
*  still very normal, but then I get to go on stage and do very abnormal things. You know, like if I [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5194.099999999999s)]
*  had to stay in my hotel room all day, cause I can't, that would make me sad. Definitely. Yeah. You're [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5199.7s)]
*  almost like Clark Kent kind of, you know, or Claire. Yeah. Quail and Quail and Kinship. Yeah. Yeah. I [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5204.0199999999995s)]
*  just, because you have some anonymity still. Definitely. There was one time you do have a chip [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5214.26s)]
*  on your shoulder sometimes though. I do. Like I was playing for a football team in New York [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5220.34s)]
*  and we were at training one night and one guy was like, are you playing shows or whatever? And I was [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5225.7s)]
*  like, yeah, I'm playing a show at the garden. And he was like, oh cool. Are you like part of a bigger [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5228.9800000000005s)]
*  bill? Are you supporting somebody? And I'm constantly just like, no, it's my show. Like people will be [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5233.38s)]
*  there hopefully. So I think people are constantly surprised how big the shows are. Cause my, I don't [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5237.78s)]
*  feel like a very famous person, which is lovely. Yeah. That's the way you don't. Yeah. I think you [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5244.82s)]
*  keep like a, you seem like a pretty regular demeanor. Nice one, man. Which I think is probably one of [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5249.219999999999s)]
*  the best compliments you can get. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But then to go and have that many people show off [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5255.0599999999995s)]
*  or something. Yeah. That's pretty fricking unbelievable. It's not. It's, you know, I think like if I, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5259.54s)]
*  I feel lucky in the sense that before I did all this, if I had a checklist of what I wanted, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5264.34s)]
*  I feel quite lucky. I feel like I've ticked most boxes, which is nice. You know, my life hasn't [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5269.3s)]
*  changed. I get to play to lots of people. I get to decide what music I put out. That feels good to [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5273.14s)]
*  me. Yeah. Yeah. How long do you think till your album will come out? Or do you have a plan on it? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5279.38s)]
*  Does it matter? I don't, I'm trying not to care. It matters, but I don't know how it works to people. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5285.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. You do? Yeah. Like, will people stick around? You know what I mean? Like I think [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5292.34s)]
*  music, you kind of have to stay relevant and stay present and release music all the time. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5297.860000000001s)]
*  You know, I think it's, I think you have to kind of do stuff constantly and constantly bring stuff [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5304.02s)]
*  out, but you got to be careful too. Cause if people just get bored, you know what I mean? I would love [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5309.38s)]
*  to, I'd love to bring out an album definitely in less than a year, but I'm not in a hurry to do it [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5314.34s)]
*  either. I would rather have a good one. You know what I mean? I don't think it needs to be just [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5319.38s)]
*  constantly doing it. And the tour off of it. Yeah. Like we've been doing touring very slow. We'll do [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5323.9400000000005s)]
*  like chunks. Yeah. It's taken three years now to do the tour. Oh man. But it's fine. Yeah. People don't [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5328.34s)]
*  care. As long as you show up, people don't care. Yeah. It's like, and it's been good and I couldn't [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5334.42s)]
*  handle doing like a seven month tour or something. I've seen like, who did I see? I saw Matt McCusker's [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5337.86s)]
*  tour and it was just every weekend, like a couple of shows. I was just, that must be so sweet to do [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5343.06s)]
*  shows and go home. Music, you can't do that because you got like abandoned crew on the road and you're [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5346.74s)]
*  paying everyone every day. So you just, you'd be bankrupt immediately. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5350.98s)]
*  Definitely. When you have such a squad, how much, do you have a big band supporting you when you go [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5355.46s)]
*  out? There's what is it? There's like six of us on stage. Oh Irish? No, two of us Irish. And then [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5360.66s)]
*  everyone else is from Australia, Switzerland and the UK. Yeah. Pretty diverse. Yes, indeed. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5369.86s)]
*  It's important. Like you kind of, even though it's a solo project, I think it has to feel like, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5377.0599999999995s)]
*  I hate when a songwriter, it looks like it's them and their employees. I think that's crap. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5381.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think it makes for a bad musical connection. I think you want to feel like a band. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5386.34s)]
*  What makes that happen? I think, I mean, bottom line, the way you treat people, you know, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5391.0599999999995s)]
*  and you give people creative freedom, you let them play the way they want to play. I think if you [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5398.82s)]
*  stifle it and sort of restrict people too much, it stops being fun. Do you know what I mean? I [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5402.66s)]
*  think people come to see my show, to see that musical interaction. It's not just me playing. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5409.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? I think it's weird sometimes when you see a solo artist and their band is just [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5414.66s)]
*  kind of in the background and not really part of the show. That's weird to me. Yeah. What, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5419.86s)]
*  um, where'd you meet your gal at? Like what? 25 years ago, probably at home. No. Yeah. At home, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5426.74s)]
*  what was she going door to door? No, she wasn't. We were, we were, it's not your sister. It's our [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5436.179999999999s)]
*  We grew up in the same area. And yeah, it's a very like, it's a very sort of high school [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5442.74s)]
*  sweethearts thing. Oh, that's, so there is some romance right there. And definitely there's [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5447.46s)]
*  something romantic about that. And is that, yeah, I guess Ireland makes me just think everything [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5452.58s)]
*  seems like, um, fairy tale over there a bit. Yeah. Sometimes too much. Certain movies and stuff, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5456.58s)]
*  you know? Yeah. What was the, I wonder if you're talking about, um, gangs in New York. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5464.18s)]
*  That one's kind of cool though. There was like this movie recently, the Irish wish or PS I love [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5470.9s)]
*  you. Those types of things. Very terrible. Yeah. Good. Fucked. Yeah. If your wife, yeah, if you've [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5474.5s)]
*  found your wife in a wishing well or something, you're out of your fucking mind, dude. Could happen. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5479.62s)]
*  You could do it. Hey, look, that's true, man. You need to go back. Oh yeah. Oh, I want to go back so [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5483.62s)]
*  bad. I want to do a couple more spots there and maybe do one more. I think I owe a little bit [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5490.099999999999s)]
*  better of a show to maybe Belfast. Um, it was good, but I think I want to, you know, you just want to [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5496.34s)]
*  do it better. Yeah. I like the way you say, I tried my best at the end of your shows. I think [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5502.18s)]
*  that's good. Yeah. Thanks, man. I think I usually, I definitely 99% of the time I feel that way that [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5505.7s)]
*  I tried my best. Now the outcome sometimes. Yeah. But then that sentiment stands above everything, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5512.26s)]
*  right? Like even if it doesn't go the way you want it to, yeah, tried my best. You know? Yeah. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5518.26s)]
*  People appreciate it too. Yeah. I think people appreciate it. I think so. That's probably a good [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5522.74s)]
*  point. Um, what, uh, what will you do when you get back to Ireland? Like what's something you look [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5527.3s)]
*  forward to doing? I will like to write music every day and to, to be like in the studio every [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5531.62s)]
*  single day. I know it's a very privileged thing to say, but it's a very taxing thing. I got tired [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5538.66s)]
*  of it. So like, I'll go just where I live is in the middle of nowhere. So I'll just be in the forest [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5542.9s)]
*  every day with the dog. Do you have a dog? No, I would like to get a dog as soon as I quit touring. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5547.46s)]
*  Yeah. In like seven months, I'm going to try to get some kind of dog. It's the best thing I've done. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5552.5s)]
*  Yeah. Oh man. Yeah. It's just like a companion. It kind of, it's a nice injection of real life as [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bloaQMc8NCo&t=5556.18s)]
