*  I haven't heard it in a while. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=101.46s)]
*  I saw you stretching a little bit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  Was that what I saw? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=104.58s)]

*  You gotta stay limber for all the sitting we're doing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  I'm getting at the age now [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=109.56s)]
*  where I can't sit for too long, dude. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=111.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=113.78s)]
*  Yeah, and that sucks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=114.62s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=115.5s)]
*  Yeah, just sitting, just fucking bothers me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=116.54s)]
*  It bothers, yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  I do notice, I thought about this, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  we're not supposed to just be sitting around. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=124.3s)]
*  Imagine if, say you went in the woods, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=126.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=128.1s)]
*  And you saw all the animals are having fun. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=128.94s)]
*  Yep, they always are. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=131.02s)]
*  Yeah, most of them are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=133.18s)]
*  Some of them are beating, killing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=134.18s)]
*  There's some. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, some of them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=136.32s)]
*  But eating is fun, though. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=137.74s)]
*  Most of them are having a good time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=140.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's violence, a lot of it's by the streams. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=141.82s)]
*  And so you know kind of. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=145.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun if you're into that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and I think most animals, and I'm also into water. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=148.22s)]
*  But that's where things get violent is down there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=154.42s)]
*  That's what I'm saying is, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=155.26s)]
*  I think nature's a blast, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=156.34s)]
*  You see it, they're herding, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=158.38s)]
*  the animals, the woodpecker comes down, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  he's like, he makes noise and people are like, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=163.26s)]
*  get the fuck out of here, we wanna sleep in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  You don't think for him that's kind of fun, though? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  Just like, wake up motherfucker. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's obviously been using or whatever. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=171.22s)]
*  He's one of the animals that got a hold of a bag somewhere. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=173.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=177.26s)]
*  Who else is rolling up like that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=178.38s)]
*  Just so early, just slamming their head against a wall. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=181.5s)]
*  And then taking off. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=184.73999999999998s)]
*  Unless he's like Morse coding a message from the heavens [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  or from like ACDC or something. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=189.54s)]
*  But you know, I'm sure every animal, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  they all conjoinively hate that MF'er. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  Conjoinively, I think they are. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=198.17999999999998s)]
*  When they see, unless one person had to get up early [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  for work and then he's like, guys, I had to invite him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and we all started to talk about this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=206.1s)]
*  because of stretching. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=209.14s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm just saying, so stretching is, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=210.54s)]
*  oh, you said sitting down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=213.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=214.38s)]
*  So I'm just saying, yeah, I don't know [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=215.22s)]
*  if we're supposed to be sitting down. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=216.94s)]
*  Say if you went into nature and you saw a bunch of animals, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=218.22s)]
*  they were doing stuff, scratching their backs on trees, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=222.14s)]
*  eating berries and tickling each other or whatever. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=225.22s)]
*  And then there's one animal off to the side [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=227.42s)]
*  who's sitting in a chair and he's vaping [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  or working on his computer. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=232.26s)]
*  You'd be like, that animal, something's not right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  He's gonna have some achy hips. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=236.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  Because humans, they weren't sitting back in the day. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=240.42s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=243.14s)]
*  I mean, rocks, they're not comfortable. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=243.98s)]
*  We have all these, we've made all these comfy chairs, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=246.38s)]
*  get us all slavin'. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=249.22s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=250.54s)]
*  So that's what, I live in Orange County, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=252.14s)]
*  so I drove up here to do this, among some other things, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=254.78s)]
*  but I drove up here and it took like an hour, 40 minutes, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=258.02s)]
*  and then I get out of my car and my hips are like. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=261.3s)]
*  Yeah, my body starts to, the top starts to lean forward. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=266.1s)]
*  My top half of my body will start to lean forward like that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=270.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=274.86s)]
*  Well, you know, my body fell apart, dude. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=275.7s)]
*  You know I was hit by a cement rock when I was a kid. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=277.78s)]
*  Were you really? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=280.26s)]
*  I was, dude. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=281.1s)]
*  How full was it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=282.78s)]
*  It was a full cement truck. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=283.62s)]
*  No way. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=284.74s)]
*  Even if it wasn't a full cement truck, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=285.58s)]
*  because that's still fucked up, but it was a full one, dude. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=287.26s)]
*  Full one's really bad. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=289.46s)]
*  It was, I think 32 tons, something like that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=290.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=293.86s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=295.06s)]
*  It hit me, I ran over the first, under the wheels, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=296.1s)]
*  and then spit me out, I flew 500 feet, dude. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=301.5s)]
*  You're lying. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=304.7s)]
*  Truths. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=306.22s)]
*  Oh my God, what's the longest field goal ever kicked? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=307.06s)]
*  That's insane, bring that up. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=308.54s)]
*  Yeah, I probably, I mean, has to be more than 500. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  No, maybe not. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=313.18s)]
*  How long is the, 66 yards, so quick math. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=314.70000000000005s)]
*  I think that's 1,000 feet, quick math. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  No, what is that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=320.94s)]
*  188. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  188 feet. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=322.62s)]
*  Oh my God, so that's like more than double. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=324.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=326.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=327.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=328.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=329.5s)]
*  What did you land in? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=330.32s)]
*  I skidded up the street, or down the street, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=331.66s)]
*  however it goes, and I was hit in one county, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=336.3s)]
*  and I landed in another county, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=341.14s)]
*  because the street was like the dividing line [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=343.74s)]
*  between the counties. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=345.42s)]
*  Still counts? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=346.26s)]
*  Yes, still counts, as a cool factoid. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  And is this the style, you got hip hop? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=349.98s)]
*  What'd you get hip hop? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=351.3s)]
*  Yeah, it was a similar style. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=352.14s)]
*  Yeah, so I got taken under those wheels. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=353.34s)]
*  Those Peterbilt's are nice, huh? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=355.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a solid truck. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=356.46s)]
*  And now what happened, were you, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=358.82s)]
*  because I have a friend who got hit by a train, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=360.18s)]
*  And he's doing- [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=362.5s)]
*  Not as funny. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=363.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, I agree. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=364.5s)]
*  He was listening to, I think, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=366.46s)]
*  Alanis Morissette or something, walking, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=367.46s)]
*  with his headphones on. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=369.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  And he's like, isn't this ironic? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=371.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=374.14s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=377.38s)]
*  Well, because it's like- [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  The craziest thing- [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  Listening to my song getting hit by train. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=380.14s)]
*  The craziest thing was, he'd been listening [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=385.06s)]
*  also to train earlier. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=387.17999999999995s)]
*  See, that would actually be ironic, yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=390.02s)]
*  But I think, but that joke only works [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=392.02s)]
*  if you had been listening to train earlier. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=394.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=396.02s)]
*  Yeah, we dialed that one in. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=397.1s)]
*  Yeah, we did a good job. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=399.02s)]
*  But yeah, you believe that they're noise canceling, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=400.14s)]
*  and then you're like, no, they're not that noise canceling. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=401.98s)]
*  He couldn't hear a train coming. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=403.9s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=407.46s)]
*  But it's effective, is all I'm saying. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=409.38s)]
*  Those headphones are effective. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=410.94s)]
*  So you're walking, where are you when this happens? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=412.66s)]
*  I would say it was Omaha, Nebraska, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=415.98s)]
*  and we were going across the street to get candy or whatever, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=418.22s)]
*  and I mean, true facts, where we were going to, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=424.22s)]
*  like we would steal pages out of Playboy or Penthouse [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=428.1s)]
*  magazines, and we were like 12, 11, 11. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=433.5s)]
*  And so that was our move. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=438.58000000000004s)]
*  We would go there, we'd rip out, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=440.98s)]
*  I don't know why we didn't just steal the magazine. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=442.42s)]
*  Because the ripping sounds loud. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=444.62s)]
*  It's way louder, but in little kid brain, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=446.26000000000005s)]
*  I was like, it's not as bad if we only steal a few pages. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=448.22s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=451.58000000000004s)]
*  Like it's where we're gonna get in less trouble [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=452.46000000000004s)]
*  if we get caught. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=454.38s)]
*  But I got one page. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=455.22s)]
*  I only got a couple pages. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=456.3s)]
*  I only got like half a tit here, mom. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm still a magazine. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=459.86s)]
*  It's just a magazine, you still have the rest. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=461.38s)]
*  Yeah, and they say they buy it for the articles, mom. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=464.06s)]
*  So I left the articles. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  So we would do that, and so my one friend [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=469.5s)]
*  was across the street, or my two friends [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=472.98s)]
*  were across the street, and they say, come on. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=474.46000000000004s)]
*  And I took that as coast is clear. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  Coast wasn't clear, Theo. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=480.18s)]
*  Yeah, three cement trucks are going up the hill [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=482.46s)]
*  as two are coming down, and I couldn't see [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=483.98s)]
*  the other side of the street. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=486.42s)]
*  It was like suburbs, the new houses were [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=487.78s)]
*  sprouting up all over, so three were coming up, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=490.3s)]
*  two were coming down, he yells, come on. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=492.54s)]
*  I'm like, take his word for it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=494.14s)]
*  Walked out behind the third cement truck. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=496.58s)]
*  Boom, bam, hot damn. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=499.3s)]
*  Did you even have a second to see it, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=501.54s)]
*  or you just lights out? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't remember it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=504.86s)]
*  This is all what people have told me. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=506.1s)]
*  My friend could have thrown me in front of the cement truck [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=507.9s)]
*  for all I know, but I don't think so. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=510.1s)]
*  Danny Hendrix did not try to murder me, I don't think. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=512.7s)]
*  Danny? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=516.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=516.94s)]
*  Or Den-Den-Dee. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=517.78s)]
*  Or Den-Dee? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=520.98s)]
*  Yeah, so that's like he may have to me. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=523.46s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. I don't know him. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=525.62s)]
*  I don't think so, he's a good guy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=526.86s)]
*  What does he do now? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=528.7s)]
*  I mean, dude, I don't know what he does right now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=531.1s)]
*  Danny Hendrix, there he is. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=533.66s)]
*  Wow, great job, dude. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=534.78s)]
*  Staffy Ninja. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=536.86s)]

*  So that's, you know, he's got a real job. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=541.38s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=542.9s)]
*  He's got a nice smile. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=543.74s)]
*  Yeah, he does, very nice. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=544.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's a handsome guy. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=545.86s)]
*  He's got a... [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, he didn't have to put his smile back together [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=547.54s)]
*  off of a street curb either. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=549.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=550.66s)]
*  Like I had to cobble my self to get back together, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=551.5s)]
*  but yeah, so from that, all those injuries, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=554.86s)]
*  I am now like, my body's just all fucked up. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=560.74s)]
*  Well, how long were you in the hospital for, man? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=564.62s)]
*  I was in for like a month and a half, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=567.3s)]
*  but then I had like two dozen surgeries within a short... [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=569.06s)]
*  Dude, my legs are all fucked up. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=574.3399999999999s)]
*  Look at this, it looks like uncooked chicken. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  Can I show you? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=577.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=578.06s)]
*  Does it gross you out? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=578.9s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=579.74s)]
*  I can see it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=581.42s)]
*  Wow, okay. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=582.26s)]
*  That's the real deal right there. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=583.42s)]
*  That's a flat. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=584.26s)]
*  Yeah, that looks like some uncooked chicken meats. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=585.3s)]
*  Damn, homie's got a flat on there. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=587.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  And is that a... [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=590.66s)]
*  Wow, can I touch that? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=591.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, touch that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=592.8599999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, that's magic. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=593.74s)]
*  It's very... [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=595.2199999999999s)]
*  It's really smooth, right? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=596.06s)]
*  This is what like older ladies, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=596.9s)]
*  this is what they want their skin, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=599.22s)]
*  not to look like, but to feel like, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=600.5s)]
*  Touch it again. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=603.22s)]
*  Oh, that's off-road skin. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=604.06s)]
*  Yeah, but that's kind of smooth, right? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=604.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=607.5s)]
*  Touch that again, I don't think you're getting... [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=608.34s)]
*  Let me touch the underside of it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=610.54s)]
*  Yeah, get the underbelly of it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=611.38s)]
*  I can't feel that, Theo. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=612.74s)]
*  The underside tickles, it tickles me a little touching it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  I can't feel that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=617.02s)]
*  You can't really? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=617.86s)]
*  No. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=618.68s)]
*  So a lot of nerve damage, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=619.52s)]
*  like was that thing just hanging on with that? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=620.36s)]
*  Because that looks kind of recandled, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=621.74s)]
*  like it looks like gum. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=622.86s)]
*  Yeah, both, and then this side isn't as bad. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  That one has a dip in it, it looks like. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=626.02s)]
*  Yeah, this is, cause this is like the actual muscle, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=627.3000000000001s)]
*  and then it dips here. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=630.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=632.46s)]
*  You know what it reminds me of? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=633.3000000000001s)]
*  That body wars thing that comes to all the exhibits, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=634.12s)]
*  body world. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=637.34s)]
*  I think it's called body world, I believe. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=638.62s)]
*  Which, and it's also, body world is pretty incredible, man. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=640.5s)]
*  It is kind of fascinating. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=643.78s)]
*  There's one where they spliced a pregnant person. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=645.48s)]
*  You have to. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=648.4200000000001s)]
*  Oh, you have to splice a pregnant person. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=651.86s)]
*  That's a new way to do a gender reveal, I think. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=654.46s)]
*  But the exhibit is set up so that one starts [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=657.22s)]
*  at the skeletal system. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=660.82s)]
*  It's an exhibition showcasing human bodies [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=663.22s)]
*  that have been preserved through a process called [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=665.26s)]
*  plastination, and dissected to display bodily systems. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  It opened in Tampa. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=671.62s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=673.12s)]
*  Which is. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=674.1s)]
*  I wouldn't have expected that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=674.94s)]
*  Tampa, they allow a lot of stuff. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=677.86s)]
*  Yeah, but it seems like a, I mean, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=680.02s)]
*  it seems like a thing that would sprout up in Boston. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=682.4399999999999s)]
*  Some Harvard people were like, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=685.68s)]
*  yo, let's start up this thing. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=686.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=688.76s)]
*  You know, Tampa doesn't feel like it should. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=689.6s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=693.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, but. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=694.16s)]
*  They may have wanted, somebody wanted it in a lawsuit. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=695.0s)]
*  I think it probably had to start in Florida, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=696.4599999999999s)]
*  maybe based on legalities or something. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=698.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was a divorce. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=699.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=701.52s)]
*  Yeah, like, someone's like, I'm keeping the exhibit. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=702.36s)]
*  So, that idea we had, I'm keeping that, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=705.72s)]
*  and I'm running with it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  The exhibit displays internal organs and organic systems, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  body stages and active poses, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=714.12s)]
*  and fetuses in various stages of development. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=715.9799999999999s)]
*  It opened in 1995. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=718.8s)]
*  Guess when I was, ran over, dude. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=720.3599999999999s)]
*  1995. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=723.1999999999999s)]
*  You're lying. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=724.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=725.56s)]
*  Maybe they read about me in the paper, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=726.76s)]
*  and were like, hey, I have an idea. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=728.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=730.4799999999999s)]
*  Let's take this. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=731.3599999999999s)]
*  Show on the road. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's take him on the road, dude. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=733.02s)]
*  Yeah, I thought, I wonder if I, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  I won't shut up about getting hit by a symmetric. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=736.52s)]
*  I hope I didn't retell that story. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=738.5999999999999s)]
*  It's fascinating, man. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=741.76s)]
*  No, I don't think so at all. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=742.6s)]
*  And here's a little bit of real body to exhibit, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=743.42s)]
*  and you just get to see the texture. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=745.16s)]
*  That's what this reminds you of. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=747.12s)]
*  You have a very kind of beef jerky from the knees down. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=748.52s)]
*  But smooth, but smooth. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  No, it's nice. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=753.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a hard jerky. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=754.48s)]
*  Well, it just also seems, you seem strong. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=757.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=760.4s)]
*  Do you think your body had to, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=761.88s)]
*  your legs had to be stronger after this because? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=763.92s)]
*  It was a ton of physical, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=766.68s)]
*  like years and years and years of physical therapy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  And what sucks now, dude, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=771.24s)]
*  is I'm back in the physical therapy grind. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=772.08s)]
*  Because of it? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=775.6s)]
*  Yeah, whatever happened, like three years ago, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=776.44s)]
*  I was shooting this show in Germany, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=778.72s)]
*  and I like was wiggling around, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=781.16s)]
*  and I kicked my leg up, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=783.28s)]
*  and I was like ping, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=784.96s)]
*  and something pinged down here in my groin. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=788.08s)]
*  I was like, ah, I got my balls popping out. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=790.0s)]
*  You know, like you have a hernia, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=793.2s)]
*  and like my insides are oozing out. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=794.76s)]
*  Not oozing out. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=796.88s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=798.24s)]
*  So then it was just something like got tweaked, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=799.12s)]
*  and then it was just like, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=801.32s)]
*  bing, bing, bing, bing, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=802.36s)]
*  and the muscles all got fucked up. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=803.36s)]
*  And so I had two surgeries. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=806.36s)]
*  I was like, it's my hips. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=808.44s)]
*  I'm gonna have, so I got hip surgeries on each side. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=809.64s)]
*  It wasn't the hips. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=811.84s)]
*  No. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=812.8s)]
*  So it's been three years of like trying [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=813.64s)]
*  to cobble my body back together, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=814.88s)]
*  and I was so fucked up, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=816.68s)]
*  and I was so tight and tense, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=817.8s)]
*  and I was getting these spasms. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=819.36s)]
*  I went to the doctor. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=820.96s)]
*  The doctor one month before my son was born [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=822.16s)]
*  was like, you're dying. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=824.84s)]
*  Swear to God, Theo. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=827.9200000000001s)]

*  Let him go. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1359.12s)]
*  That's the scary part when you keep, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1359.96s)]
*  you're like, hey, this guy's coming dumb. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1361.1599999999999s)]
*  You hold him back, and now he's gonna be, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1362.0s)]
*  now he's mad. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1363.28s)]
*  Now he's angry. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  Because everyone knows he's stupid. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1365.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's angry and dumb. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1366.8s)]
*  Yeah, so now he's in my grade. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1368.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1370.48s)]
*  And he. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1371.32s)]
*  P-5-4-5. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1372.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I smell the blood of Adam. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1374.48s)]
*  And then he is like picking on me, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1377.92s)]
*  and my dad was like, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1380.24s)]
*  hit him as hard as you can in the face, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1382.3600000000001s)]
*  and then run away. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1385.2s)]
*  He's like, try to knock him the fuck out. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1386.56s)]
*  And then he's bigger than you? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1389.3600000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, uh-huh. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1392.0800000000002s)]
*  He's like, then get out of there. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1392.92s)]
*  So the next day, I was like, he was picking on me, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1394.28s)]
*  and I just was like, shablah! [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1397.0800000000002s)]
*  And I punched him right in the nose. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1398.76s)]
*  Did not knock him out. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1400.2s)]
*  But he didn't attack. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1402.24s)]
*  He cried like a bitch. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1404.4s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then I think I became his bully, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1407.44s)]
*  which in turn, I've actually heard, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1412.44s)]
*  I've told this story on my podcast, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1414.28s)]
*  this is important, and I told that story, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1416.28s)]
*  and then I found through the grapevine [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1419.3600000000001s)]
*  that he thinks that I was his bully. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1421.24s)]
*  He doesn't remember bullying me. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1424.0800000000002s)]
*  He only remembers me bullying him afterwards. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1425.56s)]
*  Because afterwards, I just took my dad's advice. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  So he was talking shit in class. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1430.72s)]
*  I just got out a book and hit him in the back of the head. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1433.64s)]
*  And he was talking shit at the top of the stairs. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1436.92s)]
*  I fucking kicked him. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1439.3200000000002s)]
*  And he fell down the stairs, dislocated his shoulder. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1440.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1443.6000000000001s)]
*  So I think I was fucking really violent. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1444.44s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like you don't remember things correctly. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  It sounds like you were a violent guy. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1449.8400000000001s)]
*  It does, it does. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1453.92s)]
*  But I thought, in my head, he's the aggressor. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1454.92s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1459.28s)]
*  Maybe I'm a little piece of shit. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1460.0s)]
*  But I thought I was in the right. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1461.52s)]
*  But I was like, I'm smaller, so I have to be more violent. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1463.24s)]
*  Or else I'm going to be the one getting my ass kicked. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1467.36s)]
*  So. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1471.04s)]
*  Yeah, we had a kid at after school care. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1472.36s)]
*  We went to a religious after school care. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1474.12s)]
*  Because they would donate it to you [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1476.2s)]
*  if you prayed a lot or something. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1477.72s)]
*  So my mom would get a couple prayers in, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1478.76s)]
*  and then you got free care for the kids or whatever. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1480.32s)]
*  Good deal. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1482.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, so she was hitting the urinal or something? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1482.92s)]
*  No, it's not a urinal. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1486.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1486.84s)]
*  Where you pray. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1487.2s)]
*  Confessional. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1487.76s)]
*  Confessional, right? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1488.4s)]
*  Way different than a urinal. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1493.28s)]
*  God, I hope this guy, God, please make this piss come out [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1495.16s)]
*  right. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1498.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1499.64s)]
*  No, it's OK, dude. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1501.2s)]
*  But yeah, so she would make a bunch of deposits [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1503.6s)]
*  in the confessional or whatever. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1507.48s)]
*  And then they gave you free child care [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1509.04s)]
*  for the after school, right? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1511.52s)]
*  And we had this one kid named Jeep was his name. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1512.96s)]
*  He was named after a vehicle, right? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1515.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1516.92s)]
*  So they named him Jeep. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1517.76s)]
*  I was like, well, that's not how it works. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1518.96s)]
*  But my buddy Scott's daddy was like, you know what? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1520.88s)]
*  If he's being mean, you go up on that upper deck [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1523.88s)]
*  and hum a piece of concrete off at him. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1526.0s)]
*  And did you do that? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1529.76s)]
*  I don't remember if we did it or not, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1530.6000000000001s)]
*  but I just remember that advice being like, that is. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1531.64s)]
*  Aggressive advice. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1533.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1534.96s)]
*  But yeah, Jeep was problematic, and he would body [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1536.2s)]
*  slam other kids and stuff. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1538.64s)]
*  Yeah, that sucks, dude. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1540.56s)]
*  But everybody had a bully, man. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1542.24s)]
*  But you talked about it on a new podcast. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1543.92s)]
*  You have a new podcast, Wade, I know this, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1545.64s)]
*  the guys from Workaholics, you guys started a new podcast. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1547.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1550.48s)]
*  It's not new. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1551.32s)]
*  We've been doing it a while now, but. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1552.16s)]
*  You repick it up or something? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1553.72s)]
*  Yeah, we don't promote it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1555.3999999999999s)]
*  So we've just been doing it in silence. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1558.96s)]
*  Yeah, no one knows about it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1564.3999999999999s)]
*  It's called This Is Important, but it's, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1565.76s)]
*  yeah, me and the Workaholics guys, it's super fun. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1567.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun, dude. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1570.0s)]
*  And what a way to keep that thing alive. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1571.76s)]
*  What a way to keep an experience alive. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1573.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a fun way to get together. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1575.28s)]
*  It was during the pandemic, actually, we started it, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1578.0s)]
*  and we were like, dude, we never see each other anymore. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1580.28s)]
*  We're bored. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1584.92s)]
*  Let's just crank this bitch out. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1586.24s)]
*  Bring up a photo of the gang right there with the pod. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1587.72s)]
*  Yeah, this important, we're actually pitching [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1589.8s)]
*  a new show together. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1591.36s)]
*  Yeah, so the boys might be back. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1593.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1597.0s)]

*  Yeah, we're. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1598.68s)]
*  What a great group you got with too. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1599.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1601.84s)]
*  It's rare that you have a show, right, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1603.84s)]
*  like Workaholics, which was such a hit, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1606.48s)]
*  and then you now get to have an experience [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1608.28s)]
*  where you guys are still kind of together, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1610.48s)]
*  even podcasting, right? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1612.48s)]
*  And with Jim Stone's ending, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1614.28s)]
*  what's it like when something big like that ends? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1616.6799999999998s)]
*  What's it like when a project that you've done [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1619.72s)]
*  for a few years ends? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1622.04s)]
*  I know even just doing a small movie [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1623.8799999999999s)]
*  that it was like the last day, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1625.52s)]
*  it felt like the last day of school, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1626.56s)]
*  and it was like, and we weren't even, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1627.76s)]
*  and we were kind of close, but it had only been [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1629.32s)]
*  maybe 30 days, but this is years of your life. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1631.08s)]
*  What's that? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1634.08s)]
*  Dude, it's way different. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1634.92s)]
*  Like a movie, doing movies is so fun, right? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1635.84s)]
*  Like it's a lot of work, like way more work [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1639.2s)]
*  than people think. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1642.2s)]
*  They think it's all glitz and glamour. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1644.28s)]
*  It kind of sucks. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1646.32s)]
*  It's a nightmare. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1647.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1648.0s)]
*  It really is a nightmare. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1648.82s)]
*  It's a living, you're up and you're down, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1649.6599999999999s)]
*  and you're up and you're down. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1651.2s)]
*  You're almost like a zombie that has to do some stuff. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1652.04s)]
*  I love it though. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1654.0s)]
*  I love like putting all the little pieces together, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1654.84s)]
*  and you feel like you're the quarterback of a football team, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1657.28s)]
*  and the whole crew's working together, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1660.72s)]
*  and everybody's working for one common goal. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1662.2s)]
*  But then when it's wraps, a movie, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1665.54s)]
*  you really only spent like two months together, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  or however long, and so it's like saying goodbye, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1671.56s)]
*  and it's difficult because you've made friends [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1674.8s)]
*  with some of these people, but then on a TV show, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1677.96s)]
*  it's years and years of your life, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1680.96s)]
*  and you really form like real friendships [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1684.48s)]
*  with some of these people. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1687.6s)]
*  So I like that better in the way that, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1688.44s)]
*  like some of these crew people, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1691.16s)]
*  I'm gonna know for the rest of my life. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1692.28s)]
*  And then it's just nice to build a relationship. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1694.2s)]
*  So that's what I love about TV, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1697.76s)]
*  and I'm trying to pitch another show [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1699.2s)]
*  with the workaholics guys, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1702.2s)]
*  and working on a few other projects [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1703.64s)]
*  that I hope I can get off the ground TV-wise, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1705.04s)]
*  because it's nice just to have something [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1709.3600000000001s)]
*  that you can come back to every year, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1710.96s)]
*  and grow with the characters, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1712.44s)]
*  and have it morph over time. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1714.3600000000001s)]
*  Gemstone's ending, that show was a wild ride, dude. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1717.0s)]
*  It got us through the pandemic, through two strikes, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1720.48s)]
*  through all these ups and downs, all this turmoil. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1724.0s)]
*  It was nice to come back and have this be kind of home base. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1726.12s)]
*  And I know you just recorded with Danny [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1729.6799999999998s)]
*  a couple weeks ago. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1732.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1733.12s)]
*  Oh, isn't he the best, dude? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1733.9599999999998s)]
*  He's so great. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1735.24s)]
*  I was a little bit nervous. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1736.08s)]
*  I wish I had just talked about more regular stuff. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1737.0s)]
*  We talked about some family stuff. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1738.9599999999998s)]
*  It was great. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1741.72s)]
*  You just always kind of have your druthers, you know? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1742.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1744.28s)]
*  But I had no clue what he was gonna be like. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1745.1599999999999s)]
*  There's not a ton of stuff out there about him. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1746.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, he likes to be mysterious, you know? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1748.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's good, he does a great job of it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1752.28s)]
*  And he was talking about how by not having social media [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1753.8s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff, it just keeps him, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1756.08s)]
*  it lets him have his brain space for himself. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1757.6s)]
*  He's like, you have to have time to be kind of just, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1759.52s)]
*  where your brain's not doing anything, you know? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1761.9599999999998s)]
*  And he's so good about doing what he does, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1763.6799999999998s)]
*  and not feel, I think it's so easy just to be like, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1767.12s)]
*  I have to be everywhere, I have to be doing, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1770.52s)]
*  and I feel this way sometimes. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1773.44s)]
*  I'm like, why don't I have a Snapchat presence? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1775.12s)]
*  Like fucking Snap, who am I? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1779.0s)]
*  I'm not like a 14-year-old TikTok girl. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1781.44s)]
*  Yeah, you'd be a pedophile if you had one. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1784.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't need to be a pedophile. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1787.28s)]
*  I just want to, everyone's doing it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1790.24s)]
*  It is Hollywood, dude. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1793.2s)]
*  It's Hollywood, man. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1794.24s)]
*  Yeah, so, and he's just the coolest boss, man. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1796.6399999999999s)]
*  Is he? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1800.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1801.08s)]
*  You know, you meet him and you're like, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1801.92s)]
*  I was the same way, you're a little on your heels, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1803.44s)]
*  you're a little intimidated, right? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1805.68s)]
*  Because he's such a presence. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1807.44s)]
*  And I remember the first time I met him, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1809.24s)]
*  I was, it was at an after party for like, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1812.52s)]
*  this is the end or something. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1815.68s)]
*  And we were doing a movie that Seth Rogen produced, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1817.4s)]
*  Game Over Man, which I did with the Workaholics guys, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1820.88s)]
*  and so we were there at the after party, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1823.3200000000002s)]
*  and I was trying to smoke with Seth, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1825.48s)]
*  like go toe to toe with him. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1828.96s)]
*  And I smoke weed, I'm good at smoking weed, I would say. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1830.36s)]
*  Not as good as Seth Rogen. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1833.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he looks like he's part of a joint. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1835.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, he looks, human joint. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1838.52s)]
*  And so, I'm like in a fucking daze, fully crossfaded, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1840.04s)]
*  and also he doesn't drink, but I do, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1845.12s)]
*  so I'm like just guzzling vodka [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1847.28s)]
*  while still trying to keep up with him. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1849.12s)]
*  And through this cloud of- [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1851.3999999999999s)]
*  And you have stiff person syndrome, so you're fucking- [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1852.24s)]
*  This is pre-stiff person. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1854.52s)]
*  This is pre-my stiff person. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1856.1599999999999s)]
*  But out through this cloud emerges Danny McBride, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1857.48s)]
*  and he's on like my Mount Rushmore, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1861.48s)]
*  you know, favorite comedian. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1863.1200000000001s)]
*  And just seeing him walk up, he just has this, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1865.28s)]
*  everything that he says is his character, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1867.8400000000001s)]
*  so it's like, it's just him. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1870.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like on my heels, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1872.48s)]
*  and so I go, you're Danny McBride. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1875.52s)]
*  And he's like, dude, yeah, I know. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1879.68s)]
*  And he's like, hey man, nice to meet you. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1881.8400000000001s)]
*  And then I looked at him, and I said, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1883.76s)]
*  you're a bright shooting star. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1886.88s)]
*  What? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1890.6000000000001s)]
*  Like what the fuck, dude? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1891.44s)]
*  You're a bright shooting star. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1892.28s)]
*  I said, I told him you're a bright shooting star, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1893.52s)]
*  which I think is like a- [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1895.72s)]
*  Native American type of thing. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1897.4s)]
*  Might be a Native American, but it's also like, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1899.16s)]
*  I think from Boogie Nights or something. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1901.44s)]
*  And so I said, you're a bright shooting star, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1905.52s)]
*  and he's like, yeah, okay, man. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1907.56s)]
*  And I grabbed my girlfriend at the time, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  and I was like, we have to leave. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1911.68s)]
*  You have to leave. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1912.8s)]
*  And he's like, I'm having a good time, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1914.6000000000001s)]
*  why are we leaving? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1915.44s)]
*  I'm like, I just called Danny McBride [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1916.2800000000002s)]
*  a bright shooting star. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  And she was like, you're right, let's get out of here. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  Like yeah, fucking, you're out of your mind, dude. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=1922.2800000000002s)]

*  I know how to do, whoop, I know how to do this quick. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2553.06s)]
*  You don't want to get out of the diaper phase, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2556.54s)]
*  and then suddenly you're like, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2558.3s)]
*  oh fuck, I gotta do this again. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2559.14s)]
*  You have to dust them off or whatever. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2560.86s)]
*  Yeah, well like how do I even, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2562.3s)]
*  yeah, what do we do in here, dude? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2564.82s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's true, knock them all out. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2568.34s)]
*  We just had Candace Owens on, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2570.62s)]
*  she has had four kids in a row, one, two, three, four, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2571.86s)]
*  she's on her fourth child right now. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2574.34s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2575.7400000000002s)]
*  Per year, so it's just like. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2576.5800000000004s)]
*  Oh, that's a lot. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2577.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, at that point you're kind of running a distillery, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2578.5800000000004s)]
*  it seems like. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2580.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's too much. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2581.46s)]
*  Well, I feel like it finally got to the point [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2582.98s)]
*  that my wife is allowing me to touch her a little bit, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2584.78s)]
*  like sometimes, so then I know if we run it back [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2588.6600000000003s)]
*  and have another kid, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2592.2200000000003s)]
*  then it's off the table for another year, you know? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2593.06s)]
*  So that sucks. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2596.86s)]
*  But it kind of fits, so with your Jim Stone's character, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2598.42s)]
*  your Jim Stone's character is now fully [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2600.94s)]
*  a homosexual male, right? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2603.98s)]
*  That is right, that is right. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2605.3s)]
*  And what's that been like, what's that journey been like? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2606.94s)]
*  Like how did you get, did you? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2610.02s)]
*  My wife doesn't love it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2612.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2614.1800000000003s)]
*  She's not super attracted to that guy. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2615.02s)]
*  That guy. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2618.3s)]
*  Yeah, it was, you know, it was, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2620.46s)]
*  it kind of seemed like it was going that way, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2623.62s)]
*  and it was really fun to play like a character [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2625.78s)]
*  that had like a secret, you know? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2628.34s)]
*  Little secret that I didn't want to divulge. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2630.9s)]
*  So it was nice this season, I'm out, I'm proud, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2633.94s)]
*  and I could just like be, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2637.02s)]
*  because I don't know about you, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2640.02s)]
*  but I have like some gay family members, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2641.02s)]
*  and when they finally came out, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2644.06s)]
*  it was like they had a new lease on life. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2646.38s)]
*  They just seemed happier, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2648.82s)]
*  they like, a new personality emerged from their cocoon, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2650.58s)]
*  they broke out of the hetero shell, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2654.98s)]
*  and now they can just be gay-yay, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2657.34s)]
*  and so it was super fun to play that. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2659.86s)]
*  Dang. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2662.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2663.82s)]
*  Yeah, and did you have to, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2664.6600000000003s)]
*  did you have to like channel any specialty, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2665.9s)]
*  or special gay folks, or do you call a gay that you, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2670.5s)]
*  or a gay person, did you contact some other gay people, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2674.7000000000003s)]
*  did you take like a small, like a weekend retreat [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2677.1400000000003s)]
*  or something, is there any? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2679.94s)]
*  No, I didn't, yeah, there wasn't a lot of gay- [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2681.02s)]
*  Like channeling. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2683.94s)]
*  Yeah, it was mostly just acting. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2684.78s)]
*  I didn't go on any gay retreats, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2688.1800000000003s)]
*  not that I'm opposed to it, but- [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2689.94s)]
*  No, I'm just wondering, did you, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2691.26s)]
*  and do you have to ask like a, is there like a, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2693.1400000000003s)]
*  because like sometimes with some black stuff, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2697.5400000000004s)]
*  if you want to use any word, you have to get a pass, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2699.3s)]
*  you have to- [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2701.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you would really need a lot of cosigners on that. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2701.98s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2704.1800000000003s)]
*  Like a lot. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2705.0200000000004s)]
*  There'd have to be like a long list, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2705.84s)]
*  it was like all these people said I could say it. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2707.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2709.2200000000003s)]
*  But anyway, yeah, I was just wondering, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2710.0600000000004s)]
*  do you have to get a gay pass from an acting guild [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2710.94s)]
*  or anything to play? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2714.5800000000004s)]
*  No, I think I just did it, I hope I don't get in trouble. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2716.34s)]
*  You're rude. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2720.78s)]
*  Yeah, fuck, now that you're kind of airing it out, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2721.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm a little bit like, did I do them dirty? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2724.5s)]
*  But I don't think so, I don't think so. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2727.9s)]
*  Yeah, I have some gay friends and they were like, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2729.9s)]
*  it's great, it's fantastic. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2732.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2734.5s)]
*  Because I think I walked the line of being a little [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2736.26s)]
*  flamboyant in moments, but then not in other moments, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2739.82s)]
*  as a gay man. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2743.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and as your character, let's bring his character [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2745.66s)]
*  up too here, just so we can get a gander at him as well. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2747.8199999999997s)]
*  I also have been pulling some looks [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2750.1s)]
*  the last couple years, dude. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2752.66s)]
*  For sure. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2753.8199999999997s)]
*  My fashions are on point. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2754.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was not shocking, I don't think, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2756.38s)]
*  to people that your character could have this going on. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2759.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2764.8599999999997s)]
*  Because there's also, there's always a surprise [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2765.74s)]
*  gay person in a lot of religious families. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2768.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2771.7799999999997s)]
*  And look at this. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2772.62s)]
*  Look at that guy, look at that sex pot. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2773.46s)]
*  I mean that guy could be seven or 41. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2775.62s)]
*  That's exactly how old I am. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2779.94s)]
*  And this guy's been fucking, this is unbelievable, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2781.54s)]
*  to say this even exists. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2787.82s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I know, it was such a fun character to play. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2789.06s)]
*  You know where I channeled the character [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2791.9s)]
*  was a lot of wrist work. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2795.82s)]
*  Like I just do, because when you're acting, for me, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2797.66s)]
*  if I'm not playing like Adam DeMamp from Workaholics [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2802.3s)]
*  was pretty similar to myself, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2806.1800000000003s)]
*  just the more manic version of myself, you know? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2808.1000000000004s)]
*  So I didn't have to do a lot, but other characters [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2812.1400000000003s)]
*  where I'm like, he's different than me. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2814.1400000000003s)]
*  I have to find something where I can click in physically. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2815.86s)]
*  I found like just doing different things with my hands, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2819.1000000000004s)]
*  I would be able to channel him in ways that isn't me. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2822.82s)]
*  I can totally relate to that. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2828.34s)]
*  Like sometimes when you go to costumes for a part [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2830.2200000000003s)]
*  and you'll try on different ones [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2833.5s)]
*  and then you'll put on like a certain outfit [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2834.82s)]
*  or something to have you in, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2836.7400000000002s)]
*  and you're like, oh, this is kind of it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2838.1000000000004s)]
*  And you start to feel a little bit different [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2840.02s)]
*  or you'll like, kind of like, if you walk around. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2842.1800000000003s)]
*  You hold yourself a little differently, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2845.02s)]
*  you strut around a little differently. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2846.82s)]
*  For me, it was on Gemstones, I got, they gave me these, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2849.26s)]
*  well, I actually requested them, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2853.38s)]
*  you know how like certain people will wear glasses [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2855.5s)]
*  even though they don't have anything wrong with their eyes? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2858.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2863.58s)]
*  It's like a fashion thing. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=2864.42s)]

*  like I can reach out, like you throw me a ball [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3150.14s)]

*  And what, I don't understand, how did it, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3180.02s)]
*  were you taking blood flow from that area in your, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3182.8199999999997s)]

*  and they said that it was either going to grow, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3187.66s)]
*  like attach, and it was gonna be fine, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3191.7s)]
*  or more than likely was so charred, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3195.8999999999996s)]
*  it was just gonna flop off. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3198.7799999999997s)]
*  And it was, I mean, this is gross, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3201.46s)]
*  but it was maybe one of the first times I ejaculated, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3204.2200000000003s)]
*  and I'm in this bathtub, and I'm like, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3206.86s)]

*  the toe go up. The little toe [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3212.78s)]
*  just floating in the glunk. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3214.14s)]
*  No! Yeah. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3216.1800000000003s)]
*  And did they meet up? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3217.94s)]

*  Why? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3224.66s)]
*  Kind of a nasty dude. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3225.5s)]
*  You would think that it would be able to help it. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3226.34s)]
*  Yeah, all of a sudden it just like regrows. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3228.98s)]
*  DNA in there. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3230.86s)]
*  Yeah, all of a sudden it grows a toenail. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3231.7000000000003s)]
*  And then. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3234.7000000000003s)]
*  All of a sudden it's like, it turns beautiful pink, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3235.54s)]
*  and I just reattach it, click, click. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3239.86s)]
*  I screamed out, and then my mom came in, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3242.46s)]
*  and it was like, oh, what? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3244.98s)]
*  And I'm like, my toe, and then she's trying [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3246.2200000000003s)]
*  to fish the toe out, and I'm like, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3247.9s)]
*  get out of here, get out! [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3249.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3261.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3262.1400000000003s)]
*  I do, I do, I'm not afraid to admit. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3263.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3265.78s)]
*  Yeah, I like it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3266.6200000000003s)]
*  I think it's normal. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3267.46s)]
*  I like it. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3268.3s)]
*  I don't like it that, I used to like it, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3269.26s)]
*  and now I'm like, what are we doing? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3271.42s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that, and I get that, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3272.78s)]
*  and that's how a normal man should be, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3275.3s)]
*  but I'm like, when I'm away, like, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3277.6200000000003s)]
*  I get a wife and kid at home now, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3280.38s)]

*  Time for some hand magic, huh? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3288.0600000000004s)]
*  They stop giving lotion in hotels. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3289.2599999999998s)]
*  A lot of hotels, they don't have the lotion nearby. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3291.8599999999997s)]
*  Really, they used to have a small free thing of lotion. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3294.5s)]
*  They used to always have the lotion. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3296.54s)]
*  Now, the last few hotels I've been in, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3297.8599999999997s)]
*  nice hotels, they don't have the lotion. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3299.3799999999997s)]
*  I think too many people were jerking off. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3301.8599999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3304.06s)]
*  They were like trying to cut the jerk off numbers. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3304.8999999999996s)]
*  They were trying to knock those down. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3306.1s)]
*  I wonder if there's a shortage or something. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3307.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3309.74s)]
*  It's probably Doge. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3311.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3312.54s)]
*  They're like, what are we doing? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3313.3799999999997s)]
*  We're spending all this money on lotion? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3314.22s)]
*  Like, we spent $4 billion on lotion? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3315.06s)]
*  How do we subsidize lotion, dude? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3320.18s)]
*  Man, the mainstream media is a big machine. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3322.58s)]
*  I believe that that's conclusive. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3325.46s)]
*  There's no more debating that. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3329.02s)]
*  They shape stories, they hide parts. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3331.22s)]
*  So we're never really seeing the whole picture. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3334.58s)]
*  Before you know it, you're stuck in this echo chamber, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3337.3399999999997s)]
*  just getting one side of the story over and over. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3339.5s)]
*  That's how the algorithms work. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3343.1s)]
*  That's why I like ground news. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3345.7s)]

*  And I'm like, geez, chill, dude, this is a human being. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3818.2200000000003s)]

*  Yeah, so he's murdered. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3824.8s)]
*  Bum fights, how about bum with fries? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3827.34s)]
*  Like what? Like that, dude. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3831.0600000000004s)]
*  I can't believe that. A little happy meal. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3832.82s)]
*  A very unhappy meal. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3835.8199999999997s)]
*  Where was he and what district was he hitting people in [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3838.14s)]
*  or what section of the country did he even? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3840.46s)]
*  I think this was Iowa, Nebraska zones. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3842.1s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a good area to, if you know, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3845.42s)]
*  I feel like bums be passing out on train tracks there. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3849.66s)]
*  If you were to think of like a classic [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3852.2599999999998s)]
*  bums be sleeping on train tracks, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3855.62s)]
*  that would be, you think of that area. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3857.7s)]
*  That's the realm, yeah. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3859.74s)]
*  Why do people, it amazes me [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3861.42s)]
*  that people get hit on train tracks. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3863.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like, that's the only place, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3864.9s)]
*  you can be five feet away from there. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3866.86s)]
*  Just don't fall asleep there. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3869.54s)]
*  Like why there? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3871.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know, I wonder if it's warm. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3872.34s)]
*  Maybe the tracks are, they conduct some warmth [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3873.86s)]
*  because the trains go up and down them. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3875.86s)]
*  Maybe, I would say just also maybe 15 feet away. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3877.02s)]
*  Right. Right, and maybe. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3880.5s)]
*  Or, and cover yourself up. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3881.86s)]
*  You know how there's usually rocks along the side? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3883.1s)]
*  Just cover yourself up with the rocks. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3885.54s)]
*  Yeah. Off to the side. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3887.1s)]
*  Right. That seems warm. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3888.58s)]
*  That seems warm. I agree. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3890.58s)]
*  Yeah, look at this warm guy on these rocks, huh? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3891.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I think, do you think [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3893.58s)]
*  you would be a good homeless person? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3894.86s)]
*  Let me think for a second. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3897.58s)]
*  I think you get the hang of it quick. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3900.5s)]
*  I think I would commandeer an area of a park. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3901.94s)]
*  That's what I would do. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3904.54s)]
*  I would find a park, stay in it for a couple days, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3905.7s)]
*  and see like an area where nobody really goes. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3908.2599999999998s)]
*  See, that's the hard part, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3910.5s)]
*  because in LA, there's people everywhere. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3912.06s)]
*  You gotta go, you know. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3914.98s)]
*  And maybe some of these fires were, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3916.86s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, I'm not pointing blame, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3918.5s)]
*  but like, it would make sense. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3920.54s)]
*  I know if I was a homeless guy, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3922.1s)]
*  I'd be up in them hills, man. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3924.58s)]
*  I'd be up in them hills. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3926.86s)]
*  I'd be covered in like coyote skins, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3928.14s)]
*  because I've gone on some hunts, right? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3931.3399999999997s)]
*  And then you have a little bonfire, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3934.42s)]
*  and you're just roasting coyotes and stuff for food. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3936.06s)]
*  Yotes, they call them. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3938.7799999999997s)]
*  Roasting yotes. Roasting some yotes. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3940.8199999999997s)]
*  And then you maybe have your own little like barbecue stand, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3943.62s)]
*  but only for other homeless people, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3947.1s)]
*  and they're like, oh shit, I gotta roll up in them hills, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3948.62s)]
*  get some yotes, get a yotes burger. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3951.46s)]
*  Ron's slinging yotes, yeah. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3953.42s)]
*  Ron's got a fresh batch of yote on the grill. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3955.42s)]
*  Yeah, so that's kind of what I think I'd be doing. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3957.38s)]
*  So you'd be high-end homeless then, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3959.62s)]
*  because you're- [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3961.5s)]
*  Well, I think if you're gonna be homeless, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3962.34s)]
*  you wanna be high-end. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3963.94s)]
*  But they're gonna call the police immediately. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3965.14s)]
*  Poor people would just be like, oh, there's a, you know, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3966.7400000000002s)]
*  that's gonna be me in a week. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3968.94s)]
*  But rich people are like, get this guy. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3971.58s)]
*  Yeah, get this guy out of here. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3973.14s)]
*  But you have to be so up in the hills, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3974.1s)]
*  they don't even know you're there. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3975.26s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're talking about. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3976.1s)]
*  And you're killing yotes, so you're doing a service. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3976.94s)]
*  Rich people don't want yotes around, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3980.9s)]
*  because they kill the dog, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3983.7000000000003s)]
*  they kill like little dogs and stuff. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3984.78s)]
*  You could tell them straight up, hey, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3986.3s)]
*  I'm gonna be back behind your house, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3987.42s)]

*  throw it back there. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3992.86s)]
*  I think that's how you had to do it, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3994.1400000000003s)]
*  because you don't want anyone, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3995.6200000000003s)]
*  no one wants just someone living right behind their house, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=3996.86s)]

*  homeless people start to battle against each other. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4043.94s)]

*  I know he's covered in fur and eating a turkey leg, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4067.98s)]

*  Yeah, dude. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4084.46s)]
*  Most hobos have a campsite, tread softly. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4086.26s)]

*  because I don't think hobo is a derogatory term. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4103.78s)]
*  In fact, if I was homeless, you know how now you have to say [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4106.78s)]
*  there's like a new term for homeless? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4111.06s)]

*  and a knapsack, you're riding the rails. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4121.06s)]
*  Yeah, the rave cotton I do. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4122.74s)]

*  he jumped train cars for a little while. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4136.02s)]
*  I think that'd be fun to do. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4137.66s)]
*  He said one of the problems is though, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4138.9s)]
*  this is one of the big mistakes that hobos make. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4140.46s)]
*  Because are hobos technically people that ride the trains? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4143.02s)]
*  Is that who it is? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4145.54s)]

*  go up, walk up and down the trains and kick them out. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4152.74s)]
*  And my dad was like, I'd let him sleep. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4156.66s)]
*  He's a good man. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4159.38s)]

*  That you're dead, hit people with trains [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4163.22s)]

*  but distinct, a hobo travels and is willing to work, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4174.179999999999s)]
*  a tramp travels, but avoids work impossible, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4176.26s)]
*  a bum neither travels nor works. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4178.58s)]
*  Bums, that kind of, I mean you don't want to be called a bum. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4181.7s)]
*  If they call you a bum, you're like offended. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4185.0599999999995s)]

*  A hobo's like, hey I'm getting out there, I'm mixing it up. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4188.94s)]
*  I'm willing to work, I'm willing to work. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4191.74s)]

*  Yeah, will travel. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4196.34s)]
*  But I think one of the things is a lot of them [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4197.78s)]
*  die in the train cars because they close the door [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4200.219999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4209.3s)]
*  Yeah, and also my dad says sometimes there are grain cars [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4210.38s)]
*  and you can climb up and then the grain is like open [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4213.660000000001s)]
*  and you can climb in and then you sink into the grain. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4217.620000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4222.06s)]

*  Took your coat off, stood in the grain. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=4225.06s)]

*  He said he I said he said this these lips haven't seen a school lunch in two years. That's what he said [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=5905.900000000001s)]
*  So obviously he's living high on the hog dude. I don't even know [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=5911.42s)]
*  I thought he was mute because all I've ever seen him do is [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=5914.26s)]

*  And he's showing his jawline. That's what's kind of cool about him is he doesn't have much of a jawline [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=5929.26s)]
*  But I like he's just like I don't give a shit. I got the Rizzo come come at me [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=5934.18s)]

*  You know I don't know if Hollywood knew that they wanted Eastbound because people are like why don't they make they make shit like [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6925.54s)]

*  Nobody was asking us for something like vice principal [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6936.06s)]
*  it was like we just made it and then said we know this is funny and then they jump on it because [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6939.22s)]
*  You can't expect them to think of the next thing there. That's not what they do anymore [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6945.54s)]
*  He didn't say that's not what they do anymore [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6951.34s)]
*  But that's what I start to realize they don't have that creative thing anymore. That's our job [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6952.58s)]
*  That's our job our job is to give them what we think is the funniest thing and that's what we did with [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6956.82s)]
*  Workaholics and we're gonna try to do with this new show if we actually get to make it is like [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6963.3s)]
*  You make what you think is the funniest and what you and your friends would laugh at and what you want to see [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6968.94s)]
*  What you want to actually watch yeah, and then hopefully other people get on board [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6975.62s)]
*  And I you know I feel and I think you have a finger on the pulse too is [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6980.14s)]
*  We know what we like and it seems like a lot of other people like what we like as well, so [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6985.42s)]
*  You know I think you just have to make shit that you think is fun and funny and what? [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6991.860000000001s)]
*  Not even what other people want to see because they don't even know they want to see it until you make it, right? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=6997.14s)]
*  So that's it. That's the thing and that's a lot of things. It's like [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7003.5s)]
*  If you wait forever to get somebody to sign off on your thing [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7006.96s)]
*  Then it might not happen you just have to go and try and figure it out and investing in yourself [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7010.639999999999s)]
*  That's what I was like if I lose investing in myself. I don't really fucking lose [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7016.32s)]
*  It's like and at least you did it you had that experience, and you know the nuts and bolts of creating something now [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7020.0s)]
*  So if you decide to do it again, you can go this is what I would change. That's what I do differently [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7025.74s)]
*  and also the like [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7031.36s)]
*  Like [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7034.0s)]
*  With people [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7036.96s)]
*  Making something that they think other people would want to see that's where you lose when you start to go I [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7038.879999999999s)]
*  I know that they want to see this type of show like this is what's selling or this is well [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7046.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know I think that's when you get in a little trouble like make what you want to make and [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7051.879999999999s)]
*  Then hopefully that'll catch on because as soon as you go start to like go down the path [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7058.12s)]
*  Then it's derivative and people are like didn't we already see this show we've already done this then you're just kind of folly out [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7063.5199999999995s)]
*  Then you're just a follower. Yeah, you know, but yeah, it's tough [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7068.76s)]
*  It's tough [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7071.58s)]
*  It's tough to figure it out and obviously you and I are we're speaking from a place where you know we can afford to try [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7071.96s)]
*  And make a project so it's like sure you know not trying to sound [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7076.5199999999995s)]
*  Like knowing that there's not a barrier to entry to that for regular folks [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7080.48s)]
*  It's not that huge I agree. Yeah, I agree [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7084.56s)]
*  It's so different now that you can get a camera you can get a phone you can figure something out yourself how to make things [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7087.64s)]
*  You know well it was like when we did work a halt not to just keep harping on this shit [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7092.4800000000005s)]
*  But there's this is my experience is when we did workaholics [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7097.84s)]
*  It was the barrier of entry had just lowered it used to be like to make something like that it was [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7101.52s)]

*  For $50,000 or whatever and everyone had to put it on credit cards and like to try to make something that maybe would work [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7113.360000000001s)]
*  I need a slurp off some producer somewhere. You have to you're constantly gobbling [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RQn1NV9F8A&t=7119.84s)]
