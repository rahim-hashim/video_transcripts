*  I, that's what I enjoy doing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=178.16s)]
*  So yeah, going to work every day and try to make some, some sort of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=179.28s)]
*  fun content, entertain people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=183.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=186.04s)]
*  I saw some videos on there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  You were having fun with some of the Japanese players because yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=187.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  They were, uh, it's, it's kind of interesting because they don't speak the same language. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  So the same, the type of, you know, banter back and forth that you'd normally have, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  you can't really have. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  So the banter becomes a little bit more like body language and facial expression. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  So it was a challenge to like get that there, but it's also fun. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=207.64s)]
*  You know, it's like a new experience and like baseball is kind of a universal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=210.92s)]
*  language, so they kind of understood. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  And I understood is, is cool experience. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=219.28s)]
*  It's fun when you don't speak the same, cause even you just have to make a look [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=219.44s)]
*  or do something with your hands. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=222.56s)]
*  Like everybody, everybody's like a mime. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=223.72s)]
*  All of a sudden. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=225.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=226.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  The kind of subtle cues of human behavior become more important. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=227.56s)]
*  The facial expressions, the body language, the like, you know, pauses, you know, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  stuff like that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=236.55999999999997s)]
*  And the, I love the moment when you and another person who speak a different [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=238.0s)]
*  language realize neither one of you knows how to say what you want to say. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=241.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  So the side of it just like, yeah, it just, that moment you're like, oh, okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  Uh, you just kind of, maybe I should thank you for your time and try somewhere else. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  Um, and you were playing in Japan, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=256.88s)]

*  Uh, I'm sure I heard it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=265.44s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=266.72s)]
*  I think it means our friendship begins. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=268.32s)]

*  There'll be just smaller, uh, you know, not as many teams. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=424.92s)]
*  And how, uh, how was your team? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=428.88s)]

*  Um, unfortunately we lost our first two game in playoffs and got eliminated. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=433.0s)]
*  Um, but, uh, no, we had to get, we had a good team, a lot of talented guys. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=435.92s)]

*  The people are super polite, super nice. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  Like culturally it's very different than the United States in a lot of different [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  ways. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=473.0s)]
*  And that was one of the things that really stood out as like how nice people are. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=473.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=478.84s)]
*  On the home stay that I went on. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=479.52s)]
*  So you got to go stay with a family for a couple of nights. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=480.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=483.0s)]
*  So I show up over there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=483.4s)]
*  Uh, I, they speak Japanese. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm, I barely speak English, right? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  So we're just like, dude, it's so, it's like real quiet and they made like a [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=489.84s)]
*  little meal for me and, uh, we just sat around this little table on the floor and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=493.76s)]
*  ate. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=497.84s)]
*  Did you, so did you have to sit on the floor? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=498.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I think they might have put some wick, like a thin mat and we sat there [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=500.32s)]
*  and then, um, I guess when I walked in, I gave the lady just a hug and a kiss, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=504.88s)]
*  just on the cheek, just kind of how I am. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=509.96s)]
*  Um, and throughout the next couple of days, she would have her friends come over [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=512.6s)]
*  just so I would hug and kiss them on the cheek. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=518.48s)]
*  She was like, Linda, Linda, and like the doorbell would ring and she'd be like, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=521.48s)]
*  do it, you know, and it's hard to, and she just kept having friends come. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=526.6s)]
*  So I would give them that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=530.64s)]
*  I think they just thought it was interesting. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=531.64s)]
*  And then they let me sleep in their room. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=533.24s)]
*  I think like, and I think they slept in the wall or something. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=535.4s)]
*  I swear they're like, they stood up and like in the wall all night and just [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=538.28s)]
*  didn't sleep. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=542.44s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=543.36s)]
*  So I could sleep like, it's just a lot of, um, I don't know if it's like sacrifice [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=543.8s)]
*  or just extreme respect. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=549.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=553.2s)]
*  What do you feel it like it is? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=553.48s)]
*  You don't talk, you don't try to explain. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=554.68s)]
*  Respect deference. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=555.84s)]
*  They, so they, what I've, what I learned, and I could be wrong about this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=558.08s)]
*  This is just what I've been told and explained. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=564.4s)]
*  Cause obviously I didn't grow up there and all that stuff, but, um, they care a [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=566.0s)]
*  lot about the good of like the group as opposed like over the good of the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=570.24s)]
*  individual. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=574.36s)]
*  So if the individual needs to sacrifice something to make the group environment [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=575.32s)]
*  better, the individual is expected or, or used to offering to sacrifice. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=578.96s)]
*  So it makes sense. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=583.44s)]
*  Like if you have a guest in your house and they could be more comfortable [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=584.52s)]
*  sleeping on the bed and you can spend a couple of nights not sleeping on the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=588.72s)]
*  bed, I can totally see how that would be, how that would be a thing. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=591.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=594.76s)]
*  It was baffling, man. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=594.92s)]
*  I was just, it was like, I felt so respected. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=595.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  It was, it was pretty fascinating. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=599.8s)]
*  I had a similar experience. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=601.72s)]
*  I, you know, they were so respectful that I was like, no, no, no, I'm, I'm no [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=603.16s)]
*  better than you guys. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=608.64s)]
*  Like, I'm just another, like we can just be person to person here. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=609.52s)]
*  And it's not that I'm like above you or something. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=613.08s)]
*  I almost felt like I was viewed as being above other people. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=615.08s)]
*  And I don't like that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=618.24s)]
*  I just, I just like to, like, I'm not better than you or anyone else. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=619.12s)]
*  I'm just a normal person. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=622.4s)]
*  Let's just like interact on a fair playing field level playing field here. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=624.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=627.24s)]
*  I don't like being like looked down on by people and I don't like being put on a [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=627.72s)]
*  pedestal by people. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=630.84s)]
*  And I know they didn't do it intentionally, but it almost felt like half the time, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=631.96s)]
*  the interactions that I did have with people, even just, you know, fans out in [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=636.6s)]
*  the community, taxi drivers, waitresses, hosts, stuff like that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=639.8s)]
*  I almost felt like I was on a pedestal and it was a little uncomfortable for me. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=649.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=650.24s)]
*  But it's cool. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=650.64s)]
*  Like that they, you know, there is that respect and there is that like deference [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=651.24s)]
*  to the other person. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=657.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=658.64s)]
*  They're almost excited. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=658.76s)]
*  They're almost so excited to like respect you or to show you how respectful it can be. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=659.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  That's a good way of putting it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=664.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=665.1999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  What a, what a, what a interesting experience just to get to go in and be there. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=667.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=671.6s)]
*  Like how was it overall? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=672.4000000000001s)]
*  It was great. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=674.44s)]
*  I've always wanted to do that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=675.6s)]
*  So I had an experience in 2009 played on collegiate team USA and we had a five game [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=677.7600000000001s)]
*  series against the collegiate Japan team. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=687.1600000000001s)]
*  And so we played over in Japan, played at like five different stadiums. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=689.5600000000001s)]
*  We were there for I think 12 days. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=692.0s)]
*  They were packing stadiums, like 40,000 people for a college baseball game. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=694.2s)]
*  Now I'm coming from West coast baseball, which doesn't have the type of fan following [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=699.1600000000001s)]
*  as like the sec does. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  We, we draw like some nights, 50 people to a game. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=704.88s)]
*  Some nights, like a couple hundred people at UCLA. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=708.4000000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to this stadium, this professional stadium, the Tokyo Dome, and there's 40,000 [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=710.4000000000001s)]
*  people or something in the Tokyo Dome for a college baseball game. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  And I remember in 2009 saying like, I got a, before my career is done, I'm going to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=718.96s)]
*  play baseball in Japan. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=723.28s)]
*  I'm going to experience this because the fan culture is so crazy there. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=725.68s)]
*  It's like European soccer. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=730.24s)]
*  There's like packed and chanting and the passion, everything like that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=732.0s)]
*  But like for a baseball game, bands playing nonstop. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=734.8s)]
*  Like that was college ball. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=739.56s)]
*  That was college ball. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=740.8s)]
*  It was, you know, the Japanese style. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=742.04s)]
*  They had a band for the Japanese team, but they also provided a band for the American [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=743.76s)]
*  team. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=747.64s)]
*  So we had a band playing for us, even though we were the visiting team, which is, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=747.96s)]
*  which is the most Japanese thing ever. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=753.56s)]
*  It was, it was awesome. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=755.4s)]
*  So yeah, I've always wanted to do it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=757.68s)]
*  I was happy to have the opportunity to do that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=758.88s)]
*  The travel is different. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=762.92s)]
*  The baseball, even like the technical little details of the game, like the way it's [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=764.24s)]
*  played, what's emphasized is different. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=769.04s)]
*  Fan culture, like it's, it was such a great experience. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=771.84s)]
*  The food, I'm a huge sushi fan. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=775.64s)]
*  So like the first time I went in 2009, I didn't have sushi and it was because I [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=777.36s)]
*  didn't have a translator with me and I didn't know what I was ordering. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=782.32s)]
*  And I had heard back then that if there's certain types of fish, that if you eat it [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=784.84s)]
*  and it's not cut right, you can die like puffer fish or something. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=787.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=790.0s)]
*  I heard that rumor too. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=790.52s)]
*  People were saying that in our neighborhood and shit. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=792.12s)]
*  I'm like, dude, none of us are going to eat any puffer fish. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=793.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=797.08s)]
*  But I couldn't tell what it was on the menu because I didn't read, you know, Google [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=797.84s)]
*  translate didn't exist back then in 2009. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=800.92s)]
*  So I didn't have sushi and that was one of my regrets. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=803.36s)]
*  So I ate a lot of sushi this past year to make up for it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=805.68s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=809.6s)]
*  I remember people like, bro, can't have any puffer fish, man. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=810.0s)]
*  If it ain't cut right, you could die. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=812.8s)]
*  I'm like, dude, we could fucking, we're, we're lucky to split a Jimmy John tomorrow. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=814.28s)]
*  Like, let's be real, like nobody's bringing puffer fish in our neighborhood. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=819.6s)]
*  Like some people are just obtuse, man. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=824.76s)]
*  So I want to know like how you kind of started in baseball. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=828.56s)]
*  Cause like, like I think everybody kind of like, there's this like ambiance in [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=830.8s)]
*  the universe, like there's a lot of information in the world about how you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=835.48s)]
*  ended up like having to go to Japan or one of the, you know, like the, some of [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=838.4s)]
*  the overall reasons because you weren't allowed back in major league baseball. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=842.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=845.72s)]
*  But how did you like get into baseball? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=846.4s)]
*  Like, like when you were like, who brought it to you first? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=848.32s)]
*  Like what brought it, what brought baseball to you? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  I think like my earliest memory of baseball is I had this little [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=854.28s)]
*  plastic bat called fat bat. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=858.9200000000001s)]
*  It was maybe a foot and a half long, had a big old barrel of plastic bat with a [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=860.84s)]
*  football bat. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=865.12s)]
*  And I remember being out in the front yard at my house and my dad would toss me [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=866.4s)]
*  a wiffle ball and I would, you know, I would hit the ball and run around the yard. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=870.72s)]
*  And we had this little like brick wall that was maybe like, you know, one cinder [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=874.92s)]
*  block or two cinder blocks high. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=881.44s)]
*  So I'd always try to hit the ball over that for a home run. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=882.88s)]
*  So I must've been two years old or something at that point. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=885.76s)]
*  I think I was always just drawn to it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=889.32s)]
*  I always wanted to, you know, like when I was growing up, what I wanted to go do [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=892.4000000000001s)]
*  was play baseball, practice baseball. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  I was always out in the front yard playing pickle or three flies you're up [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=900.0400000000001s)]
*  with some of the neighborhood kids. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=903.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, some people go out and play basketball or football or whatever. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=905.0s)]
*  Like we played baseball on my block. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=907.72s)]
*  So, and where was that at? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=909.36s)]
*  Where were you guys living? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  I was up in Valencia. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=911.6400000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=912.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=913.5200000000001s)]
*  In California. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  Um, what's it like there? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=914.72s)]
*  What's Valencia like? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  Dude, there's tumbleweeds when we moved out there, like open plots. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=917.1600000000001s)]
*  And now it's all malls and shopping centers and stuff like that, but really [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=920.5999999999999s)]
*  nice community, lots of trees, but like planned neighborhoods and stuff. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=924.7199999999999s)]
*  So we actually lived maybe like a five minute bike ride from one of the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=929.52s)]
*  public parks up there. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=934.4s)]
*  So when I was growing up, I just ride my bike with a bucket of baseballs up to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=935.3599999999999s)]
*  the park, safe community, everyone just run around. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  It was a different world back then. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=942.8s)]
*  I'm 33 now, so I'm talking, you know, 30 years ago, I'd be up and down the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=943.8399999999999s)]
*  Paseos and out all day. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=948.04s)]
*  And, um, yeah, I love Valencia. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=949.7199999999999s)]
*  Um, parents still live there. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=953.0s)]
*  I still go back all the time. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=954.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh, nice, man. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=956.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=956.68s)]
*  So you get out there and ball you can see, and that was just the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=957.12s)]
*  sport that you kind of took to. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=959.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=961.24s)]
*  I played soccer, um, I guess, or football, depending on where you are in the world. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=961.8s)]
*  Um, but, uh, played that until high school. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  Um, but when I got to high school, I was in like AP classes and playing [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=969.28s)]
*  baseball and I didn't have time for soccer. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=973.12s)]
*  And I was always just much more drawn to baseball anyway. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=975.0799999999999s)]
*  So yeah, never really played any other sports, just been [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=977.8s)]
*  baseball pretty much my whole life. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=980.56s)]
*  Did you collect the cards too? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  Uh, I collected baseballs and autographs more than cards. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=984.0s)]
*  So my dad and I would go to spring training every year. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=987.3199999999999s)]
*  We'd make the drive. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=989.24s)]
*  It's like six hours from LA to Arizona for, oh, for the Diamondbacks. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=989.9599999999999s)]
*  Uh, Diamondback, there's a bunch of people out there. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=994.04s)]
*  Diamondbacks. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=996.3599999999999s)]
*  Um, I mean, I actually, I remember when they just put the Royals in the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=997.3599999999999s)]
*  Rangers facility out there and they started moving in, but the Oakland [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1000.12s)]
*  A's Cubs have been out there forever. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1002.8399999999999s)]
*  Brewers, like a whole bunch of teams. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1005.12s)]
*  I think there's 15 or 16 teams out in spring training in Arizona. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1006.8s)]
*  Now we go right here. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1010.64s)]
*  You have white socks, A's, Giants. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1013.4399999999999s)]
*  Some great teams. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1013.8s)]
*  Um, did you ever get to see Mark Grace out there? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1014.68s)]
*  Um, no, I don't remember if I saw Mark Grace, but, uh, I [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1017.64s)]
*  remember when Ichiro came over, I guess, kind of drawing the Japanese connection. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1023.04s)]
*  But I remember when like Ichiro first came to the Mariners and we're like, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1026.8s)]
*  oh, there's this like new guy from Japan. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1030.8s)]
*  It's supposed to be really good. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1033.0s)]
*  And it's just kind of a sensation. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1034.32s)]
*  And then, uh, I remember standing there with a ball outside of the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1035.84s)]
*  fence at spring training, like Ichiro, Ichiro trying to get an autograph. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1039.96s)]
*  Um, and then he went on to be like just the best hitter that's ever lived [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1044.08s)]
*  or something, you know, and we had no idea that he's going to be that successful. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1047.44s)]
*  But I remember being a little kid and just standing there at spring [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1050.44s)]
*  training, watching the guys. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1052.9199999999998s)]
*  Did he sign the ball? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1054.04s)]
*  I don't think, I think he was, um, I think he was off to another field or something. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1055.2s)]
*  I don't remember if we had to know. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1060.04s)]
*  I w we had to know. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1061.2s)]
*  That's why I, yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1062.08s)]
*  Um, yeah, so that was your world. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  And so you, and then you just became good at it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1065.6s)]
*  Like, like, did you love, did you just love practicing it so much? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1067.44s)]
*  Like, how did it? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1071.08s)]
*  Yeah, I love practicing. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1072.2s)]
*  I love, I just like doing anything baseball related. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1073.32s)]
*  So I was always thinking about it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1075.92s)]
*  I was always out playing it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1077.48s)]
*  So I think I developed some skills that way and I was always like good ish, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1078.8s)]
*  but I was never the best guy. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1083.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1084.8s)]
*  I never made like the best tournament team or the best all-star team. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1085.12s)]
*  Even in my freshman year of high school, I was like not the, the ace [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1088.84s)]
*  pitcher. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1092.24s)]
*  Um, but I also love like math and physics and I took a class in ninth [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1093.52s)]
*  grade with a guy, Martin Kirby is a physics class. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1098.72s)]
*  Martin Kirby is a British guy. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1102.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1104.2s)]
*  So he had this accent and like he made class really, really fun. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1104.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1108.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1109.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1109.76s)]
*  The Brits, dude, you just fucking believe them, you know, you know, they go home and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1110.08s)]
*  drink, but he had a, he had a picture. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1113.52s)]
*  Um, so he used to be a smoker actually, and he quit cold Turkey one day, but he [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1116.2s)]
*  put two packs of cigarettes in his mouth, lit them all at the same time. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1120.08s)]
*  So he had that picture on the wall, like just him with two packs of cigarettes in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1123.56s)]
*  his mouth and he said, he like got so sick after that that he just never wanted [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1127.52s)]
*  to smoke again, but yeah, he's a, he's, it was such a fun class and I started [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1130.96s)]
*  learning about like physics and how leverage works and velocity and energy [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1136.28s)]
*  transfer and momentum and all that. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  And I started trying to take class and apply it to baseball. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1143.4399999999998s)]
*  And at the same time, I went down to a training facility in Texas actually for [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  the first time, it's a Texas baseball ranch. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1149.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1151.76s)]
*  And, uh, they were talking about some of the same concepts, momentum and, um, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1151.96s)]
*  energy transfer and whip and all this different stuff. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1157.16s)]
*  And so I, that was really when I started my, like my true devoted, like baseball [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1159.88s)]
*  development, where I was trying to take academics and apply it to baseball and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1166.04s)]
*  use a scientific method to like, get myself better. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1170.64s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1174.04s)]
*  So you brought some real homeschool energy to that deal, man. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1174.56s)]
*  I mean, that's, but so, so that was something that like, that took a, once [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1177.12s)]
*  that got added in, like this other kind of world of it that you could start to [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1181.56s)]
*  see while you were doing it and stuff and equate, then you really, I really kind of [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1184.96s)]
*  lit you up. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1188.9199999999998s)]
*  That's when it took off. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1189.56s)]
*  That's how my brain works too. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1190.56s)]
*  Cause I had like, I need to have something that I'm chasing some, like, I'm [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1192.0s)]
*  here, I want to go there. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1196.1999999999998s)]
*  I need to plot a course and like, am I getting closer to my target or not? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1198.0s)]
*  Like that's how my brain works. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1201.0s)]
*  So as soon as I had, like, I knew I always wanted to play in college. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1202.28s)]
*  That was my goal. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1206.72s)]
*  I never, well, my goal growing up was just to play on the high school team. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1207.56s)]
*  Then once I made my freshman team, I was like, okay, I want to play in college. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1210.84s)]
*  And that was really when my development was starting. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1214.76s)]
*  So I was like, okay, I want to get to college. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1216.76s)]
*  I'm currently a freshman in high school. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1219.08s)]
*  I'm throw this hard. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1220.88s)]
*  I have this pitch. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1222.08s)]
*  I have this command, whatever, like I need to improve these skillsets. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1222.88s)]
*  And so then I would wake up in the morning at like 5 33 times a week and go to the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1226.52s)]
*  YMCA and do like pool workouts. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1230.92s)]
*  I love the YMCA don't you? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1232.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1234.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1234.76s)]
*  We had a membership there. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1234.92s)]
*  I used to lift there and spend a lot of time there as a kid. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1235.84s)]
*  I always love it. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1239.04s)]
*  It just makes me feel like just part of the universe. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1241.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1242.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1243.08s)]
*  I interrupted you. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  So you would go there and you would, uh, you would just train practice, get ready. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1244.1999999999998s)]
*  I'd do that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1247.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1248.36s)]
*  Prior to school. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1248.6s)]
*  And I go do school, go straight to practice after school. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1249.52s)]
*  We'd get done at four 35 o'clock, go home, do some homework and eat. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1252.1599999999999s)]
*  And then usually like seven or eight o'clock, I'd go up to the local park and I'd be [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1256.04s)]
*  there for an extra three hours doing whatever workout I was doing or throwing or [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1259.1599999999999s)]
*  videoing myself or whatever, you know, trying to, trying to find some way to get [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1264.28s)]
*  better. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1267.76s)]
*  And that's just what I, I didn't really like do anything else. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1268.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't have interest in anything else. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1272.56s)]
*  Did you have a lot of friends? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1273.8s)]
*  Like, did you have a social world or you just really, did you, and was that kind [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1274.72s)]
*  of a choice you think you made or you just kind of get locked in on something [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1278.68s)]
*  and you, cause a lot of people that have become great at something, there's, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1281.16s)]
*  there's sacrifices to it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1284.16s)]
*  People don't realize that. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1285.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1286.44s)]
*  Um, I think, uh, it was partially that what I wanted to do was baseball. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1286.92s)]
*  So given the choice of going to the mall to hang out on a Friday afternoon or [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1292.52s)]
*  going and doing baseball, like I was naturally gravitated towards baseball. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1297.04s)]
*  Also, like I, I'm not really the most like social person, like a lot of my [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1301.04s)]
*  social interactions I learned a little later in life, starting college and [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1308.6s)]
*  pro ball and stuff. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1312.1200000000001s)]
*  I just didn't, I viewed things differently as a kid. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1312.88s)]
*  I was kind of different. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  I dressed differently. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1317.28s)]
*  I thought about different stuff. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1318.28s)]
*  My sense of humor was different than the normal kids. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1319.6399999999999s)]
*  So I struggled, I struggled socially, um, in high school, all, you know, junior [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1322.6799999999998s)]
*  high, all the way up into high school. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1327.0s)]
*  I didn't have a large peer group. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1328.36s)]
*  Um, you know, I was kind of, I was part of two different groups. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1330.7199999999998s)]
*  I was like part of the athlete group, right? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1332.7199999999998s)]
*  But I didn't fit in with them because I was also a nerd. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1334.1999999999998s)]
*  I didn't really fit in with the nerds because I was a jock. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1336.7199999999998s)]
*  And so I kind of got pickled between both of those where I didn't really [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1339.32s)]
*  have a group that I fit in with. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1342.04s)]
*  Like Clark can't almost in a way, you know, I'm in, not quite as a, as super, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1343.56s)]
*  but yeah, but well, you would turn out to be, Oh, here you are right there. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1352.56s)]
*  Trevor in the store back to when the Astros didn't have to cheat to win. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1353.04s)]
*  That's it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1355.68s)]
*  That's cool, dude. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1357.36s)]
*  Does that, does that kid look like, uh, someone that would fit in? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1358.68s)]
*  So that's actually a uniform, like I would wear my baseball, like pants and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1361.4s)]
*  uniform and stuff to school and grade school. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1365.12s)]
*  So I got, I got picked on a lot. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1367.4s)]
*  But also dude, if you slid into fourth period, you were a fucking legend. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1370.44s)]
*  I'll tell you that, you know, if you're the only person that slides head first [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1374.6799999999998s)]
*  into social studies, you fucking win as far as I'm concerned. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1378.8s)]
*  Today's episode is brought to you by prize picks. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1382.44s)]
*  If you like firing on sports, then prize picks is the app for you. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1386.36s)]
*  Instead of choosing teams, you choose individual players. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1392.8s)]
*  That's what I like about it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1396.8799999999999s)]
*  It's unique. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1398.32s)]
*  Each player has a set projection and you either choose more or [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1399.8400000000001s)]
*  less than that set projection. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1404.4s)]
*  For example, you could choose Isaiah Pacheco more than 51 yards or Brock [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1407.48s)]

*  a moment because I want to go vape, you know, just like that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1762.96s)]
*  You, you self-reflect a lot on things. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1766.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you look at your own like behaviors and stuff and like analyze yourself or [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1768.6s)]
*  like, how do you get that feedback? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1772.56s)]
*  Yeah, I started doing that more. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1774.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1775.92s)]
*  You know, I've done like some ayahuasca over the few years and I bring that up a [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1776.24s)]
*  lot, but that plant medicine, that stuff is really interesting for exactly that. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1778.88s)]
*  It helps me learn. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1782.72s)]
*  Um, it's not as much time that I spend learning something like say I'll read or [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1783.8s)]
*  write something or, or be in a class, but it's the time I go sit back with what [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1788.4s)]
*  I've written and be, and have a relation, have like a integration. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1793.44s)]
*  That's what I'm learning is so much more crucial. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1799.4s)]
*  It's like, cause for so long, I was like kind of learning and getting some, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1801.4s)]
*  getting information, but a lot of things weren't sticking because the big part I [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1805.44s)]
*  was missing out on was integration. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1808.5600000000002s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1810.5600000000002s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1811.16s)]
*  And so I think that's where some of that comes from. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1811.52s)]
*  And, um, being in conversations with getting, being in conversations with some [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1813.5600000000002s)]
*  neat people over the years and makes me start to think more, um, and leads me into [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1817.16s)]
*  like wanting to be more introspective and, and wonder why I do things. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1822.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1826.48s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1826.72s)]
*  Um, I have a brother that helps me think about that kind of stuff a lot and make [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1827.12s)]
*  me kind of question, you know, so I start to not only be myself, but also, uh, see [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1830.56s)]
*  myself a little bit, if that makes any sense. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1836.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, for sure. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1838.32s)]
*  The studies on the ayahuasca and the, uh, mushrooms and stuff like that for brain [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1839.28s)]
*  function, like, uh, treating PTSD and, you know, past experiences and stuff like [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1845.96s)]
*  that is pretty interesting. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1851.72s)]
*  I'm like, I follow it decently closely just cause I'm very interested in the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1853.4s)]
*  effects of like the brain and how you, how do you learn something? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1856.96s)]
*  How do you get over something? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1859.76s)]
*  How do you change behaviors? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1860.8s)]
*  Stuff like that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1862.28s)]
*  So yeah, it's, uh, the last couple of years has been a lot of cool stuff [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1862.92s)]
*  that's come out about that stuff. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1866.92s)]
*  That was like 10 years ago, kind of demonized and looked at it. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1868.08s)]
*  It was like this really bad thing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1871.24s)]
*  Now we're starting to learn a little bit more like, Oh, this could be useful [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1872.68s)]
*  in like these certain areas. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1876.72s)]
*  There's like shades of gray in there, right? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1877.24s)]
*  It's not just like, it's good or it's bad. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1878.88s)]
*  It's like, uh, it could be a useful tool in certain cases. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1881.0s)]
*  It could be abused in certain cases. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1883.92s)]
*  Um, yeah, it's interesting. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1886.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1888.76s)]
*  I love that. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1888.96s)]
*  I love that it's book that kind of starts becoming like a new modality or whatever, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1889.4s)]
*  whatever term people use for people to try and get well, you know, cause it almost [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1892.52s)]
*  goes really back to our roots, like literally back to like, it's like [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1896.28s)]
*  native American root medicine that they would use to like really have a better [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1899.92s)]
*  look at themselves kind of, um, but I, I recommend it. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1904.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it helps. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1907.76s)]
*  It's helped me a lot in just having different ways to think about things. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1908.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1911.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, when did you start being good at bait? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1912.44s)]
*  Like, when did it start to add up? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1915.04s)]
*  Cause if you're doing all those unique pitches, like some of the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1916.44s)]
*  pitch, like you just have such a cool, like assortment of pitches. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1919.68s)]
*  I almost feel like, yeah, somebody's rolling up to the mound. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1922.4s)]
*  This is from your channel right here. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1925.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1927.68s)]
*  Oh, this is back in, uh, 11 years ago. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1929.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1932.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1932.8s)]
*  You've had your channel for a long time. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1932.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1934.52s)]
*  I started, I think 2011, um, to do like, you know, try to connect with [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1934.76s)]
*  baseball fans and like give some information. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1940.16s)]
*  And then I actually stopped it for like six or seven years there from [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1943.16s)]
*  2013 through maybe 2019 or 2020. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1946.68s)]
*  I should have kept it going. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1950.96s)]
*  I'd have a lot more subscribers. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1951.8s)]
*  You got a great amount of subscribers. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1953.12s)]
*  690,000 is amazing. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1954.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1955.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, and did what made you stop? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1956.32s)]
*  What was the break? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1958.52s)]
*  Was you, were you getting busy with baseball? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1959.08s)]
*  No, so I actually got in trouble. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1960.76s)]
*  Uh, so I, when I was growing up, I, in high school and college, I watched a guy [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1962.8s)]
*  named Tim Linsacum and I like studied everything about him. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1968.2s)]
*  Wait, do you play for the Giants? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1971.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1972.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1972.9199999999998s)]
*  And I, from his college film, his Giants film, minor league film, like I can still [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1973.6799999999998s)]
*  close my eyes and picture like the exact delivery from a time, from a video from [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1979.3999999999999s)]
*  University of Washington, he was throwing, it was like 40 degrees that night, half [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1985.32s)]
*  long sleeve, like I can see the video in my head. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1990.92s)]
*  Um, but I studied him nonstop. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1994.4s)]
*  And one of my most fun things to do in college was every time he pitched, I would [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=1996.04s)]
*  go on mlb.com and I would see the highlights and I would just watch them over and over [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2000.2s)]
*  and over and I got a lot of enjoyment out of it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2004.44s)]
*  So I actually started putting a segment up on my channel when I signed, I was in [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2006.72s)]
*  the minor leagues, there was no way for fans to watch me pitch in the minor leagues [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2009.76s)]
*  and have that same experience of highlights. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2014.6000000000001s)]
*  So I would take video clips from the games, make a little highlight reel, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2016.24s)]
*  I called it weekly whiffs and I would put it up on YouTube channel. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2021.0800000000002s)]
*  I did two episodes of it. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2025.1200000000001s)]
*  And then the organization that I was with at the time was like, yeah, you can't do [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2026.4s)]
*  that because it was just different. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2029.88s)]
*  No one was doing that. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2031.2s)]
*  It was, you know, it can be looked at as like you're trying to embarrass the other [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2032.16s)]
*  hitters or whatever. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2036.4s)]
*  It had nothing to do with the hitters. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2037.3600000000001s)]
*  I was just trying to entertain the fans. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2038.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2039.96s)]
*  Um, and so I made a couple more videos after that, like the pitch grips video in [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2040.5600000000002s)]
*  2013 and a couple of slow motion videos here or there, but, um, it kind of, in a [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2044.24s)]
*  way it took a little bit of the fun of like trying to entertain fans out. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2049.48s)]
*  Uh, and so I just, I was off of it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2052.84s)]
*  I went more towards, uh, Twitter at the time, which is now X, but, um, trying to [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2054.8s)]
*  just have that like back and forth connection with fans and grow it that way. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2059.44s)]
*  Um, and that ended up getting me in a lot of trouble as well. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2063.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, people like you'd have your own voice a lot of times, you know, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2068.0s)]
*  which is where, you know, if you're involved in something that's bigger, like [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2071.2400000000002s)]
*  when you have to go into organizations like major league sports, college sports, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2074.2s)]
*  where there's a lot of big business interests on the back end of things, they [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2078.92s)]
*  really don't like a lot of the guys to have their own voices. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2083.04s)]
*  It seems like they don't, you're not really, you're allowed to, but are [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2085.8s)]
*  you really allowed to? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2089.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's a, it's an interesting, my perspective on that has, has changed [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2090.32s)]
*  a good amount recently. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, so coming up, I was like, okay, I'm my own person. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2095.76s)]
*  I'm going to have my voice. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2099.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you as my employer, don't control me. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2100.28s)]
*  I'm going to say what I want, whatever. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2102.48s)]
*  And I was very kind of bullheaded on that. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2104.0s)]
*  And then I started a business and I have employees and I deal with employees who [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2106.96s)]
*  remind me very much of myself and they have their own voice and they express [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2111.7200000000003s)]
*  stuff in certain ways. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2115.2000000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, I, I got to handle this a little bit differently as a [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2116.12s)]
*  business owner than I would as an employee. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2119.88s)]
*  And now I can understand the different perspective. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2122.2000000000003s)]
*  Like I'm still very, like, I'm very protective of trying to tell my [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2124.6800000000003s)]
*  employees, you can't say this or you can say this or like putting guidelines on it. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2129.0s)]
*  But I do see how someone like me coming up that has these opinions, especially [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2133.56s)]
*  when I would be like critical of the league, like here's an employee of the [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2139.68s)]
*  league who's being critical of their boss publicly. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2142.56s)]
*  And like at the time I was like, well, this isn't right. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2145.32s)]
*  And this isn't right. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2147.52s)]
*  And I disagree with this and the blah, blah, blah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2148.16s)]
*  And so I would just say it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2149.7599999999998s)]
*  And then without considering the opposite perspective. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2151.44s)]
*  And I think I was a lot more like, I can identify this problem and I'm just going [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2153.6s)]
*  to say that there's a problem and blame instead of now what I really try to do is [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2158.48s)]
*  look at and say, okay, identify a problem. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2162.6s)]
*  But what are some potential solutions? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2164.7999999999997s)]
*  Let me present the solutions that I think and have a discussion about it instead of [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2166.44s)]
*  just like, hey, you're wrong. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2170.3199999999997s)]
*  You're wrong. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2171.7599999999998s)]
*  Do this this way. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2172.2s)]
*  And what are some of that like evolution over time growing up and getting older and [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2173.0s)]
*  learning from past mistakes, starting a business, seeing other perspectives. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2176.52s)]
*  In your business, you're talking about YouTube channel, your Trevor Bauer channel. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2182.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2184.64s)]
*  Well, cool channel, man. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2185.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have a Trevor Bauer channel. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2186.2s)]
*  We have also momentum channel and Eric and Eric Sims channel. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2188.04s)]
*  We all we're kind of like a content group. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2191.64s)]
*  So momentum is the company and it's started in 2019 to grow baseball, entertain [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2195.04s)]
*  baseball fans. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2200.24s)]
*  And so we bring people in. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2201.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2204.3199999999997s)]
*  You have a lot of subs, the kids call them. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2204.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2207.7599999999998s)]
*  You got a lot of subs on there, man. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2208.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2209.2799999999997s)]
*  Eric just passed. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2209.92s)]
*  I think he's like 520 now as well. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2210.64s)]
*  So I'm at 690. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2212.2799999999997s)]
*  Momentum is at 567. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2213.3199999999997s)]
*  Eric's over 500 as well. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2215.52s)]
*  We've got a couple other creators that come in. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2217.8799999999997s)]
*  The idea is basically you bring guys in that love baseball, have a good [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2219.52s)]
*  personality. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  You have a group channel where they can get exposure to a lot of people, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2223.32s)]
*  entertain a lot of people, and then they end up growing their brands and can go [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2226.48s)]
*  in their own different directions. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2229.68s)]
*  You have someone that does gaming, you have someone that does action, you have [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2230.76s)]
*  someone that does card reviews, you have someone that does whatever. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2234.04s)]
*  And so you start branching out and entertaining all factions of baseball [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2236.76s)]
*  fans and growing the game organically where the audience is. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2240.52s)]
*  You know, one of the things that I think NBA was probably the first sport to [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2244.56s)]
*  really adopt it is the social media push, like delivering content to fans [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2248.52s)]
*  where the fans are. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2252.48s)]
*  I mean, you go on NBA or you go on Twitter or X or whatever social media [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2255.16s)]
*  platform when the playoffs are going on at NBA, it's like the second Steph [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2258.68s)]
*  Curry hits a three, like it's everywhere. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2262.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2264.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2264.48s)]
*  You have the same opportunities in baseball where it's like hard to find [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2265.36s)]
*  content. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2268.84s)]
*  And so I was like, okay, this is a problem. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2269.52s)]
*  But instead of just like blaming, I'm going to like try to actually do something [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2271.0s)]
*  about the problem. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2275.36s)]
*  So momentum is kind of my attempt to like help impact the marketability of [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2276.2s)]
*  players, help impact the growth of the game. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2282.0s)]
*  You know, young people aren't playing baseball nearly as much anymore. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2285.12s)]
*  There's so many other opportunities. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2288.2799999999997s)]
*  You got streaming services so they can watch on their iPad. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2290.6s)]
*  You got gaming that's huge, eSports. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2292.8799999999997s)]
*  People aren't outside as much playing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2296.2s)]
*  So the game is like shrinking a little bit at these levels. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2298.52s)]
*  So trying to try to grow it in ways where kids will consume the content and get [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2301.52s)]
*  interested in it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2306.76s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2307.52s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2308.52s)]
*  Dude, that's so kudos, bro. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2308.92s)]
*  This would be a part, be doing something, your job, but then also create wanting to [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2310.2400000000002s)]
*  create this other more of your job kind of, you know, like, um, this is not a lot [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2316.12s)]
*  of guys that have that have their own channels like that. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2322.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2324.64s)]
*  Baseball has given me a lot. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2324.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2326.64s)]
*  This chart's, uh, this chart said. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2326.84s)]
*  This is sheriff children, age six to 12, who participate in baseball on a regular [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2329.84s)]
*  basis in the United States from 2008 to 2021. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2333.44s)]
*  And in 2008, it says 16 and a half percent. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2337.76s)]
*  And now we're down to 12.6%. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2339.96s)]
*  It's down like 25% in the last 15 years. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2342.56s)]
*  I'm kind of shocked because I know we have a, like a larger growing Latino [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2345.8s)]
*  culture, you know, and I know baseball's big in Latino cultures, you know? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2349.7200000000003s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2352.92s)]
*  Why do you think there's been like a tail off like that? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2353.88s)]
*  Well, I think, uh, baseball has gotten expensive. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2357.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, the equipment's very expensive. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2362.7599999999998s)]
*  The travel teams, very expensive. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2365.12s)]
*  Um, also baseball isn't, doesn't have the cool factor that NBA has NBA has [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2368.52s)]
*  sneakers and P and like rap culture, pop culture, they've blended the two [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2375.2s)]
*  together in a very cool way. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2380.24s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2382.0s)]
*  And so when you're going through high school and you're trying to figure out [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2382.7599999999998s)]
*  who you are, like you want the, you want to be part of the cool crowd. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2386.12s)]
*  And it's the sneakers, it's the, the new rapper, the new album, it's the [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2390.2s)]
*  entertainer it's and that's synonymous with NBA baseball hasn't had the same [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2396.08s)]
*  like, uh, success in blending and getting the cool factor for you. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2401.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2406.8399999999997s)]
*  Baseball always was like the, there was the kids would go off and do it in high [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2407.08s)]
*  school, but you didn't really know you didn't. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2409.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2411.24s)]
*  And a lot of times you wouldn't, it wouldn't be a part of the pep [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2411.72s)]
*  rallies a lot of times and stuff. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2415.32s)]
*  So yeah, there was always a missing a little bit of that. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2416.84s)]
*  Football, you have the crossover, you have like the cheerleaders and [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2419.1600000000003s)]
*  you have the football players. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2421.8s)]
*  And these are, you know, there's like integration of like the whole school, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2423.2000000000003s)]
*  right? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2426.44s)]
*  And it's one game and the school shows up and it's our school versus your school. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2426.7200000000003s)]
*  And so there's a lot of involvement around football. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2430.52s)]
*  NBA has the pop culture integration. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2432.4s)]
*  Baseball's struggled to get that their thing. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2436.04s)]
*  Um, and you know, it's, uh, there's a lot of games, so it's not like if you miss [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2439.56s)]
*  out on this game, there's not going to be a game tomorrow. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2447.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2449.32s)]
*  So, uh, and it's always been that baseball has like an older demographic. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2450.12s)]
*  It's a slower game. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2455.36s)]
*  I think his attention spans are shrinking. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2456.84s)]
*  Tick tocks around shorts, YouTube shorts, Instagram reels, all this stuff. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2460.44s)]
*  Attention is shrinking. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2464.04s)]
*  I think that cadence of baseball is slow. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2465.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2469.3599999999997s)]
*  Um, where NBA it's like 20 seconds and then there's a new play and then this [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2469.7599999999998s)]
*  and then that football, it's like, there's always something going on. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2474.68s)]
*  Baseball it's like, well, there's, you know, four minutes in between innings. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2478.2799999999997s)]
*  And then there's 30 seconds in between a pitch. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2481.2s)]
*  Like one of the things they tried this year is like a pitch clock. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2484.16s)]
*  So it's shrink the time in between pitches, which is seemingly [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2486.68s)]
*  made the game more popular. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2489.72s)]
*  So yeah, I feel that. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2491.2799999999997s)]
*  I felt that energy when I went to some games this year. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2492.2s)]
*  It felt faster. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2494.28s)]
*  It felt a little bit more and it kept you a little bit involved because it was [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2495.08s)]
*  just enough time where you didn't kind of zone out and go get onto your phone [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2497.92s)]
*  of that extra five or six seconds. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2501.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2503.4s)]
*  Like even we're saying that extra habitual moment where you kind of start to check [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2503.88s)]
*  out, I would stay involved, you know, we went to see Zach Gallen pitch a [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2506.96s)]
*  couple of times, which was really cool. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2510.44s)]
*  Um, who else did we go? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2512.64s)]
*  Oh, going to a Padres game is so much fun, man. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2514.88s)]
*  That park is so much fun. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2517.64s)]
*  Did you go in San Diego? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2518.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2519.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2520.32s)]
*  Dude, that park is so much fun. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2520.76s)]
*  They do a good job down there. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2522.88s)]
*  Um, when so the Padres and Dodgers were, Oh yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2524.44s)]
*  A lot of, a lot of rivalry going back there. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  Dodger players won't say it's rivalry, but it's a rivalry. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2530.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2532.8s)]
*  Um, and so we, you know, in 2021 I was with the Dodgers, we'd go down [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  playing Padres and it was like so loud and so cool. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2537.88s)]
*  The stadium's like pretty compact. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2541.92s)]
*  You know, you got the, you got the industrial building out there that kind [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2543.6400000000003s)]
*  of squeezes things together and they pack it full and it's really energetic. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2547.0s)]
*  And, uh, yeah, we played some really fun games down there. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2551.32s)]
*  It is such a fun place to, uh, to be a part of. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2554.1200000000003s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2557.1200000000003s)]

*  The backdrop's really cool. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  You're right by the ocean. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2560.6000000000004s)]
*  The weather's always great. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2561.6000000000004s)]
*  Like you literally, you leave the stadium and you're just bars right there. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2562.8s)]
*  It's right downtown. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2566.96s)]
*  The best area. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2568.1200000000003s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2568.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2570.92s)]
*  Um, no, no Joe is one of my buddies who pitches over there. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2571.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2575.1600000000003s)]
*  He's, he's, he's awesome. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2575.48s)]
*  Um, yeah, but, uh, you Darvish Machado, uh, that tease. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2577.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2584.2s)]
*  That's a, that's a fun place to see a game. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2585.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2586.84s)]
*  Um, so how did, so when did you start to like, when did you like be like, okay, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2587.2799999999997s)]
*  I've got the mechanics, uh, I've been working on this so much myself. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2591.12s)]
*  I have my own interest in it. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2594.88s)]
*  When did you start to be like good and what was that like? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2596.56s)]
*  So I was, I was good my freshman year. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2600.0s)]
*  I was good my sophomore year in high school. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2604.2799999999997s)]
*  I made for, I made varsity team towards the end of my sophomore year. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2606.48s)]
*  But then I really like, I really exploded my junior year of, um, of high school. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2610.68s)]
*  My velocity jumped a lot. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2615.04s)]
*  I was throwing in the nineties. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2616.48s)]
*  I struck a lot of people out. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2618.28s)]
*  I had like a sub one ERA for the year. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2619.84s)]
*  Started getting a lot of, uh, yeah, I think I was at 0.79 ERA or something. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2622.28s)]
*  I don't remember the exact number, but, um, yeah, struck out like, uh, 106 people, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2626.04s)]
*  I think in 72 innings or something along those lines. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2632.6s)]
*  So I had a really good year. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2635.16s)]
*  I went 12 and 0 that year. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2636.16s)]
*  Our team was really good. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2637.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, actually the, there's a senior pitcher. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2639.16s)]
*  I was a junior. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2642.04s)]
*  Mike Montgomery was a senior. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2642.96s)]
*  Um, he was getting a lot of looks. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2644.68s)]
*  He ended up getting drafted in the first round by the Royals that year. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2646.72s)]
*  So we had a lot of scouts out at our games. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2650.8399999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2652.8799999999997s)]
*  So you had a lot of influence to see that this could really happen, right? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2653.08s)]
*  I mean, he's right there ahead of you and this happens in front of you. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2655.68s)]
*  So baseball is such a small world too, that like in the 2016 world series, the [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2658.2s)]
*  last person to throw a pitch for the Cubs, Michael Montgomery, the last [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2662.16s)]
*  person to throw a pitch for the Indians. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2665.84s)]
*  Me. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2667.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2668.44s)]
*  High school teammates were the last ones to throw pitches in that for our [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2669.04s)]
*  respective teams in that world series. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2671.6800000000003s)]
*  But, uh, yeah. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2673.04s)]
*  And so he was good and I don't like losing to people on my own team. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't like losing period. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2677.36s)]
*  Like I'm a super intense competitor. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2678.52s)]
*  So like he would go have a start and I'm like, okay, I got to be better than that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2680.4s)]
*  And then that really drove me to be better. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2685.2000000000003s)]
*  And so I actually, I ended up graduating high school half a year early. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2688.0s)]
*  And so I didn't, I never played my senior season in high school. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2691.36s)]
*  I just went to UCLA. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2693.96s)]
*  Oh, you went straight to go. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2695.52s)]
*  Went start. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2696.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2697.12s)]
*  So I graduated December, I think 18th and I started UCLA January 4th. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2697.32s)]
*  And then I played what would have been my senior season of high school [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2702.2s)]
*  as my freshman year in college. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2705.36s)]
*  So you must've been one of the younger pitchers that year. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2706.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2708.6s)]
*  Younger pit, one of the younger pitchers. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2709.08s)]
*  I was actually the freshman pitcher of the year in all of NCAA that year. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2710.4s)]
*  And that's after that year is when I made team USA and went played in Japan in [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2714.64s)]
*  2009 as basically a high school senior. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2718.56s)]
*  So, so what happens in that space? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2721.04s)]
*  Cause like, um, and pitching is so perfect for you. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2722.6s)]
*  Then it sounds like, cause it's your own little war that you're in. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2725.96s)]
*  You're like this, this orchestra, you're the, you're this guy, but you're also [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2729.12s)]
*  the guy playing the, you know, it's like, um, it's you versus them. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2733.04s)]
*  It's very clear cut how things go. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2738.64s)]
*  Um, what, uh, Oh dang, I had a great question. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, well, it's probably wasn't that great, but I thought it was pretty decent. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2746.0s)]
*  Um, this is my brain checks out every now and then, but hold on, I'm [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  staying with this. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2751.6s)]
*  What, uh, what about, did your ego, did ego start to build up? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2752.52s)]
*  Cause that's one thing I always talk about a lot in here. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2756.3199999999997s)]
*  Just like our ego and what that's like, you know, cause what was it like when [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2758.2s)]
*  you start to get like a claim for that? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2761.12s)]
*  If you're kind of have this social uncomfortability. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2763.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2765.7999999999997s)]
*  I, um, I've always tried to separate ego on and off the field. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2766.4s)]
*  Um, I haven't been great at it, but I think having an ego on the field is super [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2773.88s)]
*  important. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2779.88s)]
*  Like when you walk out there, you gotta know that you're the best. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2780.6s)]
*  You have to believe that you're better than him and him and him. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2783.04s)]
*  And you gotta feel like you're the best guy out there to be like the true. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2786.48s)]
*  Like competitor, you know, off the field, like going around, telling everybody [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2790.6400000000003s)]
*  that you're better than them and acting like that's not great. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2795.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2798.76s)]
*  So, uh, I'm not naturally like inclined to be egotistical. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2799.04s)]
*  I, cause I, the way I view things, it's never like a static point. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2803.6s)]
*  Everything is I'm improving or I'm getting worse. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2806.88s)]
*  It's all, it's a fluid situation. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2809.96s)]
*  And so if I'm either getting better or getting worse, I'm on a journey, just [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2812.76s)]
*  like you're on a journey, you have your struggles and your, your success is I [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2816.6400000000003s)]
*  have my struggles and successes. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2820.2000000000003s)]
*  I view myself as like, even with every other person, but on the field, like [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2821.52s)]
*  when it's competition time, like I am the best person on the field. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2827.0s)]
*  And if I'm not that day, it's because. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2830.96s)]
*  Like I didn't work hard enough or I need a better process, but like every [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2834.52s)]
*  time I step on the field, I have to believe that I'm the best person there. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2839.6s)]
*  And I've had times in my career where I lost that belief and it was, those [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2845.48s)]
*  were very dark times, performance wise. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2851.84s)]
*  I was terrible on the field and I had to like trick myself and like fake, like [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2854.36s)]
*  fake it in my own mind that I was still good. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2863.0s)]
*  And then when I started doing that, the results came back. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2866.76s)]
*  But, um, yeah, it's interesting levels of success, how you have to sometimes [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2869.6s)]
*  trick yourself to stay there, how you have to use little manipulations, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2874.76s)]
*  life hacks, all those, there's so many different things that so many different [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2879.04s)]
*  people who are top performers in their, in their world or sport or whatever [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2882.68s)]
*  it is line of work, uh, do. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2887.16s)]
*  I think I'm a little predisposed to depression for whatever reason. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2889.72s)]
*  I don't know if it's something chemical or what it is. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2894.04s)]
*  I'm a very like kind of flat personality. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2897.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't have like a ton of highs and lows. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2900.56s)]
*  So when baseball would go bad, like my mood would go really bad. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2902.92s)]
*  And I had to find a way to kind of pull those two things apart and be. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2907.36s)]
*  Regardless of baseball is up or down. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2913.24s)]
*  I needed to be able to like, be okay in my life. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2915.12s)]
*  Um, and would you do to go, did you like, would you like, if when things got bad, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2918.7200000000003s)]
*  how would you, would you booze a little? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2923.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, how would your world? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2926.0s)]
*  No, I've never, I've never been drunk. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2926.92s)]
*  I've never done drugs. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2928.52s)]
*  Um, wow, bro, you are, you are riding the fucking world. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2929.76s)]
*  Like that's in, that's intense. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2936.48s)]
*  It's incredible, man. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2938.76s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't have friends to invite me to the parties in high school. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2939.76s)]
*  I never got started, but, um, yeah, I would like, when I [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2944.64s)]
*  would have an early in my career, let's say prior to, uh, let's say July, 2017. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2948.32s)]
*  Um, I would have a bad outing and I would go home and I would study it for hours [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2954.6000000000004s)]
*  and hours and I would be up till four or five in the morning and then I wouldn't [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2960.6800000000003s)]
*  sleep well and then I'd be miserable the next day because I'm like, okay, I should [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2964.32s)]
*  have done all these things that I didn't do and now my results are bad and we lost [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2968.32s)]
*  the game and I'm this and then whatever. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2972.32s)]
*  Um, and then I was just 20, the, the start of 2017 was like the worst half of [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2975.3599999999997s)]
*  baseball that I've had and I had like a seven or eight ERA. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2981.56s)]
*  And gosh, that's a lot. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2985.48s)]
*  I could have that. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2986.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2987.08s)]
*  No, I mean, I probably could. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2987.44s)]
*  Any, anyone, any number of people could have done that. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2988.72s)]
*  Let's just say some people could have it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2992.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2993.7599999999998s)]
*  And, uh, sorry, man, that was kind of offensive. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2994.7599999999998s)]
*  No, no, I mean, it's true. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2997.0s)]
*  It's just a fact. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2998.3599999999997s)]
*  I was bad and I had to trick myself into believing that I was good because I'm so [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=2999.3999999999996s)]
*  analytical that I was like, I am the worst pitcher in major league baseball [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3004.48s)]
*  right now, factually, and I had to pull myself out of that and somehow trick [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3008.52s)]
*  myself on the field to thinking that I was good and then I also had to pull [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3013.96s)]
*  myself, split myself from baseball so I could find a way to be okay personally [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3018.2400000000002s)]
*  in life and, um, so I had to start developing some other interests, some [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3023.0s)]
*  stuff that when I went home, I would get interested in that thing instead of [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3028.96s)]
*  studying baseball so much. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3032.44s)]
*  And then from 2017 on outside of two months at the end of 2019, I was probably [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3034.64s)]
*  like a top 10 pitcher in baseball. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3039.88s)]
*  And, but that's that split of like being okay personally and finding a way to kind [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3041.64s)]
*  of like level out that depression. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3046.6s)]
*  Um, some of those, you know, really down moments, um, made me better and more [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3048.8s)]
*  stable at doing my job on the field as well. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3054.12s)]
*  And would you go spend time with the guys after the games? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3057.12s)]
*  Do you still kind of do your own thing a lot? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3059.76s)]
*  So baseball is, uh, because night, because games are played at night. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3061.68s)]
*  Like when you get out of the field, it's 11, 15, 1130. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3065.3199999999997s)]
*  So if you're going to go spend time with the guys, it's like, what bar are you [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3068.64s)]
*  going to, what club are you going to? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3071.8799999999997s)]
*  There's not a whole lot of other options on the road. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3073.7999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes you go back to the hotel room, go play cards, have a glass of wine or [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3076.7599999999998s)]
*  something in someone's room and hang out with the guys. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3080.16s)]
*  Um, but it's not like you're just going to dinner at seven o'clock [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3082.72s)]
*  and having a nice night. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3085.8399999999997s)]
*  So, um, I would typically just go from the field back home. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3086.8799999999997s)]
*  Most of the time you do, you spend with guys during season is like prior to the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3090.4s)]
*  game. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3093.96s)]
*  So you get there at noon or one play cards in the clubhouse, play some video [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3094.2000000000003s)]
*  games, joke around, whatever, or day games when you get done at four and you [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3098.2000000000003s)]
*  can go to dinner. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3101.44s)]
*  Those are usually like Sundays. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3102.1600000000003s)]
*  If you're not traveling, um, do you find yourself in social atmospheres? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3103.1200000000003s)]
*  Do you feel pretty uncomfortable? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3106.52s)]
*  Like how do you, how do you feel like in social atmospheres? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3107.84s)]
*  Do you feel pretty, has it changed over time? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3110.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's, uh, it's definitely changed. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3113.36s)]
*  I'm very uncomfortable around large groups of people that I don't know. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3115.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, I'm not very good at like starting a conversation. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3119.44s)]
*  Um, I, you know, I just, I think too much. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3122.56s)]
*  And so when I look at another person, I'm like, well, they don't want to talk to [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3126.36s)]
*  me and like, what am I going to say? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3129.56s)]
*  And well, how do I not come up? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3131.68s)]
*  I don't want to come off awkward and disturb them, but I also like kind of [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3134.48s)]
*  want to talk to them. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3137.56s)]
*  But I, and I just, I just don't do it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3138.2799999999997s)]
*  I just think too much where I watch some guys, they just like go up, Hey, how's [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3140.0s)]
*  it going? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3143.96s)]
*  And then like, have a great conversation. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3144.36s)]
*  I'm like, damn, I can't do that. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3146.0s)]
*  And you're like, God, that's awesome. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3147.96s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3153.2400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes I would always marvel at people that just had that disposition [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3153.96s)]
*  to be able to be comfortable. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3157.6s)]
*  Man, I remember there's a WWE wrestler, the Miz is his name. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3159.52s)]
*  And, um, he was just, he was always so comfortable wherever he was. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3164.44s)]
*  And it was the, I, I never saw anybody like it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3169.88s)]
*  The guy just, and he just, it was just effortless, you know? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3173.96s)]
*  And that was one thing I was always so envious of certain people that had, they [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3177.44s)]
*  didn't have to fight inside of themselves to be comfortable. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3181.12s)]
*  And, you know, and that, that was always like something I really, uh, I just [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3184.24s)]
*  noticed a lot. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3189.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3190.08s)]
*  I'm comfortable with myself, but I'm not comfortable like going into like unknown [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3190.68s)]
*  groups and like just somehow integrating myself. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3197.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, if I know a couple of people and we're out, like, I'm fine, like meeting [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3201.48s)]
*  one of their friends and having a conversation, I can talk to someone all night. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3205.32s)]
*  But I'm not the one that's, I don't know how to go start those conversations. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3208.8s)]
*  You might have a fricking hit of the tism. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3212.5600000000004s)]

*  The football coach, right? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3239.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3241.08s)]
*  He, you know, you don't see a lot of dark tism going on, but I bet he's got a dose. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3241.76s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I think there's a lot of it out there. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3245.92s)]
*  It's creeping up on all of us, but I think it's helping in some ways. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3248.7200000000003s)]
*  It's because I think we, some of us are having to evolve. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3252.04s)]
*  We've gotten into such a, a digital and like a world that is, uh, that if you have [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3255.36s)]
*  or able to conceptualize things, almost a little more electronically, sometimes [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3263.84s)]
*  it's a light word I'm using, but that you have more success because we're just [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3270.1200000000003s)]
*  becoming more like hypothetically like robots as people. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3275.36s)]
*  So it just kind of makes sense to make any sense to you. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3279.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3281.8s)]
*  I mean, prior to social media, if you're going to get information, you're going to [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3282.68s)]
*  read a book, you're going to ask people around, you're going to be in the community [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3286.68s)]
*  and like learn from people around you. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3289.7599999999998s)]
*  So your habits of, uh, ingesting information were reliant on being able to have those [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3291.64s)]
*  interactions. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3297.7599999999998s)]
*  You're outside more, there was less to do on your phone personally, like less [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3298.52s)]
*  connection digitally. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3302.52s)]
*  There was no connection digitally for a long time. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3303.96s)]
*  Your grandpa was like shitty Google. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3306.0s)]

*  If we don't look at it, that kind of stuff as a negative, I think sometimes we look [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3335.16s)]
*  at it as we're part of evolution, you know, in a way. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3339.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3577.9599999999996s)]
*  Um, I don't do well when I'm bored. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3578.24s)]
*  Like my mind needs something to be working on. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3580.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3583.2s)]

*  Um, but I think that's why getting into business has been very beneficial for me [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3585.08s)]
*  because I don't have those like blank moments or blank hours where I, I would, I [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3588.2s)]
*  would fill those early in my career. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3596.24s)]
*  I'd film going on Twitter for three hours. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3597.8399999999997s)]
*  And it was so much fun. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3600.48s)]
*  It was so much fun. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3602.24s)]
*  And I, I had fun with it, but I think me having fun with people is usually like [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3603.52s)]
*  playful banter, like I'll kind of like throw a little like jab your way and you [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3609.2799999999997s)]
*  throw them back my way. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3613.68s)]
*  And it was like, cause this jousting match. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3614.72s)]
*  And I like that because it's witty and it forces me to think and like it's, and [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3616.4s)]
*  I'm having these conversations with people and I'm like laughing and joking with them [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3621.48s)]
*  in person and you get a sense of like, I'm not being serious. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3625.08s)]
*  You can tell very clearly that I'm not being serious, but on Twitter doesn't come [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3629.48s)]
*  across that way. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3633.6800000000003s)]
*  And especially not even though the person that you're doing it with may feel that [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3634.8s)]
*  way, may not other people reading it might get really confused. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3638.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3642.6400000000003s)]
*  And so I would banter with a lot of people. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3642.88s)]
*  And I think it got construed negatively by the media. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3644.6800000000003s)]
*  I know it got construed negatively by the media, the larger media as a whole. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3647.84s)]
*  And then I get this reputation of being combative and stuff. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3652.08s)]
*  And I was never doing it from a competitive standpoint. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3654.6000000000004s)]
*  I understand how it looks that way and how it came off that way. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3656.96s)]
*  And so those blank hours where I was just had nothing to do and I was just like [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3659.92s)]
*  joking with people on Twitter and stuff off got, you know, got me in trouble. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3664.44s)]
*  Trump has a great day. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3668.7599999999998s)]
*  Porton I interviewed Donald Trump and he goes, you ever just like, he like, would [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3670.36s)]
*  you say, was he asking Nick about proofreading some of his tweets or something? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3674.44s)]
*  Trump's like, yeah, you ever just fire something off and just go to bed and just [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3678.2799999999997s)]
*  hope it's okay. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3681.96s)]
*  Trump was like, yeah, all the time. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3683.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3686.0s)]
*  You know, you're like, what the hell is going on? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3686.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3689.52s)]
*  But you do that if you think about Twitter being a parallel to like real life, like [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3690.2799999999997s)]
*  someone says something to you and you just fire away. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3695.2799999999997s)]
*  Because if you pause for five seconds to think about what you're going to say, it [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3697.56s)]
*  almost like gives you the yips. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3701.84s)]
*  Like you almost don't know how to respond then because we're so conditioned. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3703.44s)]
*  Like you say something and I'm like, I have a response. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3708.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3711.04s)]
*  But if have you ever thought about what proofreading like in real life would look [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3711.32s)]
*  like? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3714.88s)]
*  Like you would ask me something and I would think of my response and I would pause [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3715.84s)]
*  for five or six seconds and really think through my response. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3719.92s)]
*  And then I might say something slightly differently. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3725.32s)]
*  Can you imagine a conversation like that? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3727.44s)]
*  If it was like you say something and I pause for like 10 seconds and then say [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3729.08s)]
*  something back to you and you pause for like 10 seconds and like really actually [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3733.6s)]
*  think through it. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3737.92s)]
*  Like that way, could we be like processing our answer and then it would be printed [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3738.7200000000003s)]
*  out for the person? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3742.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3742.88s)]
*  It'd be so bizarre. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3743.48s)]
*  It'd be so bizarre. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3744.36s)]
*  It'd be almost like a script. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3745.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3746.6s)]
*  Probably. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3747.12s)]
*  It would be a very awkward conversation. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3747.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not like a normal human tendency to have an interaction like that. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3750.2000000000003s)]
*  So when someone, when you read something, it's like, oh, someone just said [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3753.92s)]
*  something and I'm going to say it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3756.44s)]
*  Now it takes longer to type it, but you're still having the thought. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3757.76s)]
*  And so you never have the option in person to like, okay, I just said this. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3760.96s)]
*  Now let me proofread it. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3766.04s)]
*  Let me read it again. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3767.08s)]
*  Let me check for this. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3767.96s)]
*  Let me think about my friend. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3768.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3770.48s)]
*  Is this okay? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3770.8s)]
*  Is this weird? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3771.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3772.28s)]
*  But on, on Twitter, then it's like the expectation now for, you know, people in [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3773.08s)]
*  the public eye is that you would proofread it and then you would check with the [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3777.92s)]
*  publicist or you would check with, you know, someone or whatever you would make sure [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3782.4s)]
*  that it was everything and just not the normal flow of conversation. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3786.2s)]
*  Now it might be in the future as the, as humanity moves more towards a digital [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3789.48s)]
*  presence, like maybe that's what happens. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3793.0s)]
*  It's going to be sad. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3795.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not, uh, it's not normal. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3797.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3799.08s)]
*  It's certainly abnormal. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3799.3199999999997s)]
*  What was that thing? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3800.64s)]
*  Did you bring it up, Nick, with Trump and, oh, point. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3801.2s)]
*  And I asked the president, if he ever regrets any of the content he posts often, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3805.3199999999997s)]
*  too often Trump said it used to be in the old days, you'd write a letter and [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3808.72s)]
*  you'd say, this is, this letter is really big. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3812.0s)]
*  You put it on your desk and go back tomorrow and say, Oh, I'm glad I didn't [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3814.4s)]
*  send it right. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3817.2799999999997s)]
*  We don't do that with Twitter, right? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3818.36s)]
*  We put it out and spontaneously we feel great. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3820.64s)]
*  And then you start getting phone calls. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3822.36s)]
*  Did you really say that? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3823.56s)]
*  Half the time it's like, damn, I didn't even, I never, I never would have thought [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3826.56s)]
*  that that would be interpreted that way. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3830.16s)]
*  Thought twice about it. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3831.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3832.44s)]
*  Oh, it's ridiculous now. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3833.12s)]
*  And then people like, take it down. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3834.2s)]
*  People say it's like, it's definitely, it's weird. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3835.52s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3839.32s)]
*  The way that we communicate now, how foreign it is. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3839.96s)]
*  And I think also how like, as humans, we're not supposed to adapt to the way we [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3843.64s)]
*  communicate, like it's so abnormal to nature or nature. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3849.48s)]
*  I think that a lot of it ends up making us feel sick or confused. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3855.16s)]
*  I mean, sometimes I'll send stuff to Nick and I'll be like, Hey, is this okay? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3859.32s)]
*  You know, do I seem chilled? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3862.32s)]
*  Does this seem crazy? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3863.48s)]
*  Am I gay? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3864.48s)]
*  And he's like, dude, this is fine, you're just, you're doing fine. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3866.52s)]
*  But it's like, I think, yeah. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3870.28s)]
*  And as you have some notoriety, especially for your sport, I'm sure like the, the [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3872.1200000000003s)]
*  microscope gets even, even tougher. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3877.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3881.6400000000003s)]
*  So you get through, so you're going through the major leagues. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3881.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3883.76s)]
*  You have some, there's some great videos of you out there, like impersonating [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3883.88s)]
*  like other players and stuff, dude. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3887.28s)]
*  It's so funny, man. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3888.8s)]
*  So when, when, when you start to get, get the entertainment aspect, how did that [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3890.96s)]
*  kind of come into you? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3894.92s)]
*  Do you feel like? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3895.8s)]
*  I think when I got comfortable that I was good and that I had largely like [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3896.52s)]
*  established myself where I was going to be able to have a career, like early in [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3906.08s)]
*  your career, you're just fighting to stay there. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3909.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's like, if you have a bad outing, you might not be there the next day. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3911.88s)]
*  But once you get to a certain level, it's like, okay, I have some leeway here. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3914.7200000000003s)]
*  I can't be bad forever, but if I have a bad start or two, it's not going to be [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3918.4s)]
*  like, I'm gone. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3922.36s)]
*  And so that gives you a little manageable. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3924.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3925.7999999999997s)]
*  And it gives you a little sense of like, settle in, you can take a breath. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3926.36s)]
*  You can be a little bit more comfortable. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3931.2s)]
*  And then you start having some of these longer standing relationships with guys [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3933.72s)]
*  on your team, because now you've been teammates for two, three, four years. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3938.64s)]
*  Um, and you have some of those jokes and like each game and moment becomes a [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3942.4s)]
*  little bit less serious because, because of that comfortability. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3947.84s)]
*  And then you have, you can start joking around and you can start having [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3950.7599999999998s)]
*  fun. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3953.44s)]
*  Um, so really like 2018, I had a really good second half of the year, 2017, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3954.32s)]
*  really good start to 2018. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3960.52s)]
*  And I started like feeling more like comfortable and like settled with the [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3962.04s)]
*  team and I started, you know, entertaining. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3967.28s)]
*  I'm pretty, like, I'm, I like the banter. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3970.68s)]
*  Like we talked about, I like the kind of witty interactions. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3975.8s)]
*  And so I like figuring out the puzzle of how do I like take this normally mundane [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3978.72s)]
*  thing and just put a little twist on it, like make it more entertaining for people. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3984.3199999999997s)]
*  And then yeah, starting in like 2020, really, after I started the media [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3989.3199999999997s)]
*  company, um, momentum in 2019, it was like, okay, this is an attention economy. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=3994.3599999999997s)]
*  So in order for baseball to grow, there have to be clips that are viral enough [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4000.8399999999997s)]
*  to get to the youth that they see it. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4005.48s)]
*  And like, oh, baseball is fun. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4007.36s)]
*  And then I'm like, okay, how do I start making some of these viral clips? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4009.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, let me study NBA. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4012.48s)]
*  What goes viral in NBA? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4013.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, when people do something like they dunk on someone and they celebrate it. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4015.48s)]
*  Like when LeBron's flexing on someone, like that's everywhere, right? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4019.6400000000003s)]
*  When Curry hits a three, but before he, the ball's in the bucket, he's already [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4023.2400000000002s)]
*  running down the court, like celebrating it because he knows it's in like that's [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4027.04s)]
*  everywhere. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4030.28s)]
*  So like, okay, how do you apply some of that to baseball? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4031.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like, all right, what can you do in baseball? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4034.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, are you going to celebrate a strikeout? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4035.6400000000003s)]
*  That'd be comparable to like flexing on someone when you dunk on them, right? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4037.24s)]
*  Are you going to call your shot on, you know, the day before the game? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4040.4799999999996s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to do this with this person. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4044.08s)]
*  Are you going to have some sort of, you know, what does that look like in baseball? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4045.52s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4048.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4049.8799999999997s)]
*  And so I started getting the entertainment aspect of it because I was [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4050.72s)]
*  settled with the performance. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4055.64s)]
*  Like I can entertain or, and compete at the same time. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4056.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4059.72s)]
*  So I can compete and just not do any entertainment. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4060.04s)]
*  And you're going to get the same level of performance out of me that you'll get [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4063.3999999999996s)]
*  if I'm also doing a little bit of entertainment. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4066.12s)]
*  Um, because I've. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4068.7999999999997s)]
*  That's like my base operating level is intense competition. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4070.7999999999997s)]
*  You're an interesting dude, bro. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4074.64s)]
*  I'm all messed up. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4076.68s)]
*  No, it's great. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4077.6s)]
*  My mind's my mind's. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4078.2s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4080.2s)]
*  It's just neat to get a look at how you operate, man. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4080.7599999999998s)]
*  It's, it's really interesting. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4083.2s)]
*  I appreciate you talking to me, man. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4085.04s)]
*  Um, yeah, because you're, you're, but you're right though, if you're trying to [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4086.2799999999997s)]
*  build this sport, that's what you have. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4090.3199999999997s)]
*  Those are the, you need some of those moments. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4092.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4094.04s)]
*  You know, like the, um, there's a video out there and it's a bunch. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4094.24s)]
*  It's, it's a view just impersonating some of the other players on your team. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4097.24s)]
*  I think when you're with the, um. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4100.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4102.4s)]
*  The Indians, we're in Pittsburgh. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4102.76s)]
*  The Indians. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4104.08s)]
*  It was a. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4104.76s)]
*  Shout out sunshine Clevenger over there too. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4105.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4107.8s)]
*  You know, Mike. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4108.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4109.32s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4109.639999999999s)]
*  Uh, been around Mike, man. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4110.36s)]
*  He's a, he's such an entertaining guy. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4111.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4113.76s)]
*  Um, so this is, uh, this is a funny story. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4114.36s)]
*  A lot of people don't know, like the followup to this story. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4117.719999999999s)]
*  So you can see the guys in the background of this video have rain, uh, like. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4120.2s)]
*  Tarps on or whatever. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4124.28s)]
*  It's so it's raining. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4125.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4126.48s)]
*  So you're in a rainy game and this is here, Cleveland versus Pittsburgh. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4126.719999999999s)]
*  What year is this? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4129.44s)]
*  This is 2018, maybe 20. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4130.12s)]
*  And as you come up to bat here, you keep kind of impersonating, I guess, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4135.32s)]
*  different players on your team. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4138.2s)]
*  They're, they're batting stances. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4139.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4140.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4140.8s)]
*  So we had a lot of unique batting stances this year. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4141.0s)]
*  Um, and so always like we get four days off in between starts and starting [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4143.5599999999995s)]
*  pitchers, so we're in the dugout, just messing around like you don't have anything [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4147.84s)]
*  to do. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4150.639999999999s)]
*  And so I was always grabbing something and trying to impersonate, you know, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4151.5599999999995s)]
*  Mike Aviles, Jason Kipnis, Rayburn, Brantley, like some of these guys that had [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4155.04s)]
*  really unique characteristics. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4159.16s)]
*  And so, um, at one point I think it was Mike Aviles like, Hey, when are you [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4161.4s)]
*  going to do that for real? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4165.32s)]
*  Like you won't. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4166.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, I'll do it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4167.92s)]
*  So I go and I have this at bat where I do Rayburn and Kipnis. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4169.12s)]
*  Were they all shocked? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4173.24s)]
*  They were all, if you look at the dugout, I don't know if there's a view of it. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4174.44s)]
*  They're all like laughing. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4176.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4178.04s)]
*  There that's Mike right there. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4178.32s)]
*  He's just, yeah. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4179.48s)]
*  Kipnis seems like such a neat guy. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4181.28s)]
*  Huh? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4182.72s)]
*  Kip's awesome. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4182.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4183.599999999999s)]
*  So the follow-up to this though, is I get, I walk in this at bat and so I'm on [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4184.24s)]
*  first base and I'm just a stupid pitcher, like, you know, running the bases and [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4188.12s)]
*  whatever. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4192.8s)]
*  And so the catcher, you know, obviously the Pittsburgh wasn't super like, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4193.92s)]
*  Oh, they're applaud again. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4198.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4198.96s)]
*  Pittsburgh wasn't super like pleased with that. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4199.12s)]
*  Cause they're like, you guys are joking around out here. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4202.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4204.84s)]
*  So right after that, the next pitch, like I take my lead off first and the [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4205.5199999999995s)]
*  catcher catches the ball and like fakes like he's going to throw it down. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4209.8s)]
*  First baseman was nowhere close, but I'm not used to being on base because I [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4212.92s)]
*  suck as a hitter. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4215.400000000001s)]
*  I'm never on base. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4216.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4216.92s)]
*  So he goes to throw it down to first and I freak out and I like dive back and [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4217.88s)]
*  there's no first baseman there and it's muddy and I stick in the mud and I don't [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4222.360000000001s)]
*  even make like my hand sticks. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4227.2s)]
*  I don't even make it back to the base. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4228.72s)]
*  I'm just laying there by the base looking around. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4230.04s)]
*  There's no one there. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4231.8s)]
*  The catcher never threw the ball and I'm covered in mud. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4232.64s)]
*  And he just like pointed at me and like threw the ball back to the pitcher. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4236.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like, all right, all right. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4239.24s)]
*  That's good. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4240.2s)]
*  You got me. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4240.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4241.16s)]
*  That's good. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4242.84s)]
*  I respect that. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4243.599999999999s)]
*  That's classic. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4246.28s)]
*  That's such a neat thing about life too. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4247.24s)]
*  How it works. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4249.32s)]
*  It's like the second you start to get on your high horse, even just a little life [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4249.96s)]
*  thing knocks you down. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4253.84s)]
*  Here you go. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4254.84s)]
*  There's another really good example that we're playing the Padres 2021. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4255.48s)]
*  We're at Dodger stadium. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4259.4s)]
*  And I facing, I'm facing Eric Hosmer. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4261.8s)]
*  Now I knew Hawes from he was in Kansas city when I was with Cleveland. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4265.4s)]
*  So we played each other a lot. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4268.72s)]
*  So we have a little bit of a history like playing each other. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4269.8s)]
*  So the first at bat, I throw him a curve ball. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4273.6s)]
*  He like half swings at it and strikes out and I like hit him with my sword [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4275.64s)]
*  celebration and the next at bat, he comes up, I throw him a curve ball. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4279.6s)]
*  Instead of missing it, he hits a rocket right back at my face. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4283.68s)]
*  Like it would have, it would have killed me if I didn't get out of the way. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4287.320000000001s)]
*  I ended up like laying on my back and I'm like laying down the mound. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4290.4800000000005s)]
*  Like what just happened? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4293.92s)]
*  Fortunately it didn't hit me and he's over at first base and I start to sit up [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4295.320000000001s)]
*  and there's actually a picture of me. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4298.6s)]
*  Yeah, this is probably it. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4300.0s)]
*  Is this? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4300.84s)]
*  Yeah, that. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4301.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4302.84s)]
*  And I don't know if this video clip goes long enough, but, uh, see if I laugh [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4304.360000000001s)]
*  right here. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4309.92s)]

*  Cause in spring training, I had like thrown in a path when I closed and then [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4331.36s)]
*  against the Padres and then they waited. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4337.04s)]
*  And then when he got me back, he put his eye, his hand over. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4338.96s)]
*  Do you mind this stuff? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4342.24s)]

*  Actually, if people, if people would like celebrate on me all the time, I don't [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4345.08s)]
*  care, like that's good for the game. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4349.28s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4351.96s)]
*  And it would be so kind of, there's one thing like Savannah [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4352.5599999999995s)]
*  bananas, you know, you see them. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4355.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4357.400000000001s)]
*  There's some of this shit's gotten crazy. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4357.8s)]
*  We did like doing the newsies, the musical between fucking second and third [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4359.280000000001s)]
*  inning, Jesus Christ, like a 90 minute musical. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4363.2s)]
*  Like, let's get the game going. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4366.280000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4368.04s)]
*  Uh, but it's also, there's something that's just fun about, um, just a [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4368.8s)]
*  little bit of the, of the, of the adding more to it. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4373.240000000001s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4376.6s)]
*  I think if you, you know, there's a little bit more ambiance between some of the [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4377.4400000000005s)]
*  players, it definitely right there. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4382.96s)]
*  You're like, Oh shit, he's gonna, it's almost like when you, you know, that, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4386.24s)]
*  um, like Gary Payton was going to guard, uh, Michael Jordan or something like, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4389.88s)]
*  Oh, I want to, I want to tune in. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4394.56s)]
*  Cause I know that four times they're going to face each other. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4396.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4399.04s)]
*  Let's see how this shakes out. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4399.32s)]
*  I mean, Strickland and Du Plessis just fought, right? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4400.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4403.24s)]
*  That fight was not really interesting until they had the little skirmish in the [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4403.56s)]
*  crowd and Strickland like through the elbow and they fought and then everyone's [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4408.64s)]
*  like, Oh, we got to watch this fight and the fight and it was great fight. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4412.28s)]
*  I, I thought Sean won personally, but what do you think about it? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4416.639999999999s)]
*  I thought it was three, two. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4421.04s)]
*  I thought he outstruck. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4422.2s)]
*  He outstruck him. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4423.32s)]
*  Um, didn't think that Du Plessis got much out of the takedowns, a lot of [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4424.4s)]
*  takedowns, but not a whole lot came from them. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4427.599999999999s)]
*  Um, I don't hate the decision. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4429.8s)]
*  Like very close fight could have gone either way. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4432.08s)]
*  I had it. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4433.92s)]
*  I had it three, two Strickland judges had a three, two Du Plessis. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4434.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4437.5599999999995s)]
*  You like the fights? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4438.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4439.0s)]
*  I'm a big UFC fan. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4439.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4440.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, cool, bro. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4440.8s)]
*  Me too. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4441.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4442.36s)]
*  I feel like, I feel like there should be a little more gravity if you're [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4442.5599999999995s)]
*  going to give the belt away. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4447.679999999999s)]
*  That's what it felt like to me. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4448.88s)]
*  I was like, it's this close and you're going to give the belt away. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4449.96s)]
*  Like if you're going to beat somebody for the belt, there should be a [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4453.28s)]
*  little more gravity to it. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4456.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4458.0s)]
*  I should be like definitive. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4458.639999999999s)]
*  You beat them. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4459.719999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4460.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4461.16s)]
*  Like if it's a regular match, I get it. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4461.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4463.44s)]
*  But, and maybe that's, I'm just somebody who sits in the crowd and wishes they [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4463.92s)]
*  could be tough enough to be out there, but, um, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4468.5599999999995s)]
*  yeah, I wouldn't want to be in the ring. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4471.24s)]
*  But you know, one of the things you said earlier made me think what I've [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4473.639999999999s)]
*  heard a lot of guys say, they're like, they can be great guys, neat guys, but [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4475.679999999999s)]
*  they have to believe when they go in there that they are the baddest motherfucker [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4479.12s)]
*  in the world, because if they don't believe that the, the, uh, what can happen [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4484.36s)]
*  is just, they don't stand, they're not giving themselves any sort of a chance. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4490.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4493.8s)]
*  You know? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4494.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4494.679999999999s)]
*  God, that's just gotta be. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4495.2s)]
*  I can't imagine like what that, what the walk must be like, like it's you and [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4497.56s)]
*  another human, like in a death match. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4504.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4506.6s)]
*  I, it's gotta be a crazy adrenaline rush, but it's also gotta be super scary. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4506.92s)]
*  I, I walking out to play a baseball game, like you win, you lose. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4511.56s)]
*  It sucks if you lose, but like, there's not that visceral consequence. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4516.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4521.96s)]
*  Like you walk out there, you, I don't think they've ever had a death in the [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4522.76s)]
*  UFC, but like, you get seriously hurt like bad. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4526.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4531.0s)]
*  And some of the guys, they seem already hurt before they ever fought. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4531.96s)]
*  And you're like, damn, this guy, he needs to keep whatever he's got still in the [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4534.799999999999s)]
*  tank, he's got a key, can't lose anymore. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4539.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4541.48s)]
*  You know? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4542.4s)]
*  Oh, but yeah, the fact that they, and they love it. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4542.96s)]
*  That's the crazy thing. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4545.799999999999s)]
*  Some of them, they love it. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4547.24s)]
*  Like you could see sometimes like Gagey or Poirier, just how like, just fucking. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4549.48s)]
*  That's, that's their thing. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4554.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4556.04s)]
*  That lights them up. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4556.76s)]
*  Imagine only getting to perform like twice a year or two. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4558.04s)]
*  That's the toughest part. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4560.48s)]
*  I hate, I hate baseball cadence where I only get to play once every fifth or sixth [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4561.84s)]
*  day, I can't imagine twice a year, once a year. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4565.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4568.8s)]
*  You imagine once a year. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4569.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4571.0s)]
*  Ferber Bauer gets to come out and throw some, and pitch a game. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4571.32s)]
*  For like 20 minutes. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4574.36s)]
*  Can you imagine training for a year? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4577.32s)]
*  And then you get 20 minutes and like, it could be over in 30 seconds. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4580.64s)]
*  I can't, it's almost like, I think penguins are only fertile for like 11 [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4584.92s)]
*  minutes out of the year. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4587.8s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4589.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4589.6s)]
*  That's a crazy stat. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4590.04s)]
*  I never heard that before. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4590.92s)]
*  So it's almost like that. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4592.24s)]
*  But yeah, if you find anything on that, Nick, let me know. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4598.84s)]
*  I'd almost have, I got a buddy said he had some pants. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4601.36s)]
*  I shouldn't say this, but he had the option if I wanted to get a little bit of [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4604.32s)]
*  penguin meat, which would be crazy to eat. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4607.4s)]

*  I used to see the name every day. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4959.96s)]
*  And then every time I opened my phone, that was the background picture of my phone. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4961.84s)]
*  I, every time I was looking at it, I just would see it in my mind. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4966.92s)]
*  And then I replaced that picture with now the background of my phone is my Cy Young [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4970.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=4997.320000000001s)]

*  not in, not in the moment. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5002.0s)]
*  Um, and by the time I win something, I've already like set the next target. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5004.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5012.0s)]

*  And like, so I just, it's one of my struggles. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5021.96s)]
*  I need to get better at it. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5024.96s)]
*  It was like actually enjoying the fact that I did this really cool thing. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5025.92s)]
*  What a trickster. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5031.24s)]
*  Your brain is such an, cause sometimes our brain is like a trickster. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5032.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, well it's like, and what about this? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5034.799999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like, it's sometimes if I can look at that almost like, yeah, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5037.839999999999s)]
*  and try and enjoy it, not be too hard on myself, not, you know, constantly be [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5042.28s)]
*  pushing the goal on, but sometimes if I can just look at myself and be like, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5046.24s)]
*  what a fucking trickster you are brain. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5049.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5052.08s)]
*  You're going to go and meet, you're going to, we just did it. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5052.28s)]
*  And you're going to be like, let me, let me like hang out here for a little bit. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5054.4s)]
*  I enjoy this, but if I can at least laugh at that part of me that does it, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5057.28s)]
*  instead of look at it, like, man, it just keeps moving and I'm never able to have [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5060.8s)]
*  any fun sometimes that can help me have a little bit of a different like space. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5064.88s)]
*  They're like, I get like a long-term enjoyment out of it. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5068.24s)]
*  Little, little hits of it here and there. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5071.799999999999s)]
*  So the award is actually up in my room at my parents' house, like where I grew up. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5073.599999999999s)]
*  And this is where I, you know, I still have artwork that I made in high school. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5078.12s)]
*  That's on the walls and like hats that I had signed by people that are hanging there. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5082.0s)]
*  Like it's, it's like my room. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5086.32s)]
*  And so the award is like hanging up like in my childhood room because I feel like [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5090.599999999999s)]
*  that's where it belongs. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5097.08s)]
*  Like most people will put it in like a case and like that's where the journey started. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5099.16s)]
*  Got it. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5104.36s)]
*  And like that's where I feel like it just belongs. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5104.84s)]
*  Like the young kid that like never thought he'd play big league baseball because big [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5109.08s)]
*  league baseball players are like they're superstars. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5115.24s)]
*  They're like different than me. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5117.88s)]
*  And all of a sudden I end up being one of those people and have this thing that like [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5119.72s)]
*  only the best of the best get. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5125.48s)]
*  And it's like still when I see it up there, I'm like, this is crazy. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5128.04s)]
*  Like, yeah, I have a note from my high school coach threatening to kick me off the team [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5131.0s)]
*  next to like the Cy Young award. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5134.879999999999s)]
*  Like the disparity between those things is like such a, such an interesting contrast. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5137.4s)]
*  You know? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5144.679999999999s)]
*  Bro, that's so many feelings. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5145.36s)]
*  That's so much at once, dude. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5147.919999999999s)]
*  What was it? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5149.799999999999s)]
*  What was he threatening to kick you off? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5150.24s)]
*  Or do you remember? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5151.679999999999s)]
*  Dude, I was, I have like four or five of them. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5152.599999999999s)]
*  I got thrown out of a game one time I was hitting and umpire made a bet what I thought [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5157.12s)]
*  was a bad call. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5162.24s)]
*  So I flipped my bat and I like drew a line in the sand of like where the ball across [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5163.0s)]
*  the plate didn't say a word. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5166.679999999999s)]
*  I got tossed. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5168.28s)]
*  And then of course, like you're getting thrown out of a game, not good look for the [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5169.599999999999s)]
*  high school program. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5172.44s)]
*  There's times where like the park that I mentioned earlier, where I go up and do [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5174.12s)]
*  practice, like I would go up there and throw a base. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5176.639999999999s)]
*  There's a tennis court with like a really high fence next to a big open grass field. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5180.36s)]
*  And so I would throw a long toss on the open grass field and the ball would hit the [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5184.839999999999s)]
*  fence and like die there. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5188.719999999999s)]
*  And I had to throw by myself. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5190.36s)]
*  So I'd have two buckets of balls and I would throw them all and then go pick them [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5191.5599999999995s)]
*  up and keep throwing. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5194.88s)]
*  And then one of the local tennis instructors didn't like the noise of the [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5196.4s)]
*  ball hitting the fence. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5199.96s)]
*  And so he would go and like, we had this years long like feud and he would come out [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5202.32s)]
*  in the middle of his tennis lessons and like grab my buckets of baseballs and [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5210.04s)]
*  steal them so I couldn't throw. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5213.200000000001s)]
*  And then he would like call the cops on me and all this stuff. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5214.72s)]
*  But the thing is there was no signs as public park, no signs on the fence saying [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5217.96s)]
*  that I couldn't throw against it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5222.4400000000005s)]
*  We'd gone to city council and like cleared it and made sure it was OK. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5223.4800000000005s)]
*  He just didn't like it. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5226.6s)]
*  So a lot of, a lot of just technical back and forth. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5227.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5232.4400000000005s)]
*  But you like to make sure that you, you're kind of like me. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5233.12s)]
*  I think it seems in some ways, I think I like, I always wanted to [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5236.240000000001s)]
*  make sure how I felt was known. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5239.44s)]
*  I always wanted to have my say in things. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5242.32s)]
*  So be able to have my say. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5244.24s)]
*  That's what I felt. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5246.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5246.599999999999s)]
*  And it's sometimes it's a blessing. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5247.0s)]
*  It's sometimes it's a curse. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5248.24s)]
*  For sure. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5249.12s)]
*  I had, I remember the morning that that kind of like changed for me. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5249.839999999999s)]
*  I was 17, I was in high school. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5258.4s)]
*  I had gotten up in the morning to go to the YMCA, did my pre preschool [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5261.04s)]
*  workout and came back, showered, was looking in the mirror. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5265.04s)]
*  I was like, you know, why, what, what is it about me that like, I don't have [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5267.32s)]
*  friends that people like don't like me, that they bully me, that they pick on me, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5271.04s)]
*  like all this stuff. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5274.92s)]
*  And I just made the decision that day. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5276.04s)]
*  I was like, I like myself. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5277.32s)]
*  Like I'm good in school. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5279.5199999999995s)]
*  I treat people well. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5281.16s)]
*  I'm hardworking. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5282.48s)]
*  I'm whatever. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5283.799999999999s)]
*  Like I like what I see looking back at me. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5285.5599999999995s)]
*  So I'm going to be okay with that. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5287.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm not going to, I'm going to stop chasing like approval from other people. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5289.16s)]
*  And as long as I can be proud of myself, like I'm cool with it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5293.08s)]
*  And so that gave me the freedom internally to like have a voice. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5297.96s)]
*  And when someone would say something to me, I'd fire back and I would feel better [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5301.8s)]
*  about myself because I felt like I was defending myself and standing up for [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5305.5199999999995s)]
*  myself and my life got a lot better through the rest of high school and into [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5308.6s)]
*  college because of that, because I felt like I had a voice and I was being heard [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5313.08s)]
*  instead of just being like swatted down all the time. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5317.2s)]
*  And then as my life situation changed, you know, something that can be good at [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5320.68s)]
*  one point can be bad at other points. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5324.8s)]
*  As my life situation changed, as people stopped picking on me as much as I got [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5328.64s)]
*  into professional baseball and my profile in baseball grew, I was still very quick [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5333.08s)]
*  to just like fire back at people and. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5337.64s)]
*  You know, fans normally in like the banter, like good natured way, but media [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5341.56s)]
*  people, you know, on air personalities, writers and stuff like that, they would [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5346.44s)]
*  write something about me that I didn't like or that I disagreed with her. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5352.24s)]
*  I felt was untrue. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5355.08s)]
*  That's one thing that really bugs me is when someone writes something that is not [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5356.839999999999s)]
*  true about, about anyone. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5359.96s)]
*  Like, I don't think you should, because it affects a person's reputation and stuff, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5362.24s)]
*  you know? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5367.5199999999995s)]
*  So I would just fire back at them. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5368.879999999999s)]
*  And I was like, okay, I'm justifying this to myself because they attacked me first [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5370.5199999999995s)]
*  and they said this stuff isn't true. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5375.6s)]
*  They set the terms where they're going to just come out of, they're going to go out [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5377.080000000001s)]
*  of their way to like, I wouldn't pick on them. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5380.4800000000005s)]
*  They're going to come after me. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5382.6s)]
*  Well, okay. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5383.6s)]
*  Unleash it, like fire back. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5384.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5386.040000000001s)]
*  And I would. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5386.6s)]
*  It makes good sense. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5387.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5388.0s)]
*  I would just unload on them on people though, like said some pretty hurtful [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5388.4800000000005s)]
*  things and then, you know, I get the reputation of being this like combative [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5392.160000000001s)]
*  person, which I'm not, but that's how I appeared on online. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5397.88s)]
*  And I don't think I updated my, like how I behaved and interpreted the world. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5404.160000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't think I updated that as quickly as like my life situation changed. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5411.84s)]
*  I see. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5416.6s)]
*  And so I got to a point where like, I didn't need to be doing that stuff. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5417.160000000001s)]
*  And there's a much more mature way to handle those things. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5420.400000000001s)]
*  Like just have a conversation with a person instead of just like online, like [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5423.0s)]
*  firing back. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5427.6s)]
*  Um, so that's one thing over the last couple of years, I've really tried to [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5429.12s)]
*  like update, evolve in update my, my, how I perceive the world and like how I [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5433.04s)]
*  operate in the world to match like my life situation. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5438.679999999999s)]
*  Well, sometimes it makes sense that that takes like, um, sometimes the world [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5442.12s)]
*  doesn't take into account that we have to get to certain places where we have [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5445.759999999999s)]
*  enough space to look around at our environment and update our own software. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5449.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5454.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5454.679999999999s)]
*  And, and, and sometimes it takes time. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5455.36s)]
*  It's like, and that's just what it is, you know, but, um, the media is also [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5457.96s)]
*  gross. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5463.0s)]
*  I want to, I'll say that you don't have to say that. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5463.88s)]
*  And, um, uh, I think the media is very gross these days. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5466.08s)]
*  There's countless things that are printed all the time and said that have no, uh, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5469.68s)]
*  jurisprudence. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5475.8s)]
*  Is that a word Nick? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5477.04s)]
*  Why am I saying that? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5478.4400000000005s)]
*  Sounds right. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5481.2s)]
*  Jurisprudence. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5481.92s)]
*  I don't know what it, oh, it just means a legal system. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5482.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5486.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5487.32s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5487.5199999999995s)]
*  Merit. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5488.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5489.28s)]
*  I think I remember just reading a scarlet letter and that popped into my head for [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5489.599999999999s)]
*  some reason, but I'm forever stuck on whatever books I read in like ninth grade, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5493.04s)]
*  bro, forever, dude. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5497.4s)]
*  People slowly like throw you, you have a good vocabulary. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5499.28s)]
*  I'm like, dude, if it wasn't in fucking, uh, the scarlet letter, dude, I don't [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5501.959999999999s)]
*  know it, um, but no, it's interesting, man. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5507.0s)]
*  And especially, I think learning more about you, you see like, oh, well, this [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5509.959999999999s)]
*  is this guy has had to kind of like create his own operating software to fit [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5513.04s)]
*  what works with him and his world, you know? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5517.88s)]
*  And that's, um, a lot of people, you don't get to know that about them, you know? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5520.04s)]
*  Um, I think society, there should be more, uh, the way society is right now is [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5524.44s)]
*  everything's like very short attention span and very final. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5530.24s)]
*  It is this or it is that. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5533.68s)]
*  And then that's true for the rest of time. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5535.72s)]
*  Um, where in reality it's like, this might've been the case at this specific [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5539.8s)]
*  moment in time with these circumstances, this person feeling one way on that day [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5545.28s)]
*  because of this other thing, this other person feeling this other way on, and [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5549.88s)]
*  then like that situation changes. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5553.12s)]
*  So the people change the next day, the next week, the next year. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5554.8s)]
*  But you look at, you look back at something someone said five years ago and [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5558.599999999999s)]
*  you're like, oh, well, he's a terrible person because of this, or, oh, I love [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5562.8s)]
*  him because of this one thing when like, it's a tiny snapshot of a brief moment [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5566.52s)]
*  that doesn't describe the whole of the situation, the person, the intent, the [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5573.120000000001s)]
*  anything, but society I think is like so short with forming an opinion. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5579.92s)]
*  Well, especially with athletes, you only get to see certain amounts of them. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5586.0s)]
*  Like, um, and when they go into a lot of long form conversations, a lot of times [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5590.72s)]
*  they, um, there's someone, you know, there's a lot of fear about, you know, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5594.52s)]
*  saying certain, they don't want to say to, you know, they don't want to get in [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5598.76s)]
*  trouble. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5601.0s)]
*  You only see certain, like, uh, snapshots of them on the sideline. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5601.8s)]
*  You see a guy get upset two times. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5604.92s)]
*  You have no idea what's happened or what's going on, but suddenly you're like, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5606.76s)]
*  oh, that guy's the problem. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5610.400000000001s)]
*  I saw the best example of that. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5611.96s)]
*  Um, it's NBA game. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5614.96s)]
*  I think it was Durant. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5616.92s)]
*  It might've been someone else, but, um, I'm just going to say it was Durant [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5618.4400000000005s)]
*  cause that's what I, that's what's in my head. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5622.6s)]
*  But he's doing an interview right on the court right after the game. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5624.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5627.48s)]
*  And the reporter asked him a question. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5628.28s)]
*  He's got a microphone in his face. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5629.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5631.04s)]
*  You know, the team, this and that and the other, whatever. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5631.5199999999995s)]
*  And he's got this like polished, like you can tell, like it's a, he's been trained [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5633.4s)]
*  like how to talk to the media, like say words without saying anything at all. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5640.48s)]
*  Like not a whole lot of, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5644.36s)]
*  Don't say anything at all, basically, but say something. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5645.12s)]
*  So in the middle of one of his answers, one of his teammates, or I think someone [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5647.0s)]
*  from the other team comes up to like, Hey, good game. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5651.52s)]
*  And he steps away from the microphone for like three seconds and completely changes. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5654.280000000001s)]
*  Just like, Oh, what's up brother? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5659.4400000000005s)]
*  Hey, he's great. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5661.040000000001s)]
*  That's like going into this whole thing with someone that he's comfortable [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5661.68s)]
*  with in a different way. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5664.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5666.200000000001s)]
*  And he comes back to the interview right back into like the media mode. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5666.88s)]
*  And I'm like, if that's not the perfect example of how, like, what you see is not [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5672.84s)]
*  always what is true, I don't know what is. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5677.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5680.719999999999s)]
*  There's a certain protecting of the realm in a lot of ways, you know, which part of [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5680.919999999999s)]
*  it makes sense to, especially, I think with baseball, cause baseball has this, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5684.679999999999s)]
*  um, I have to pee so bad, man. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5688.44s)]
*  Is that okay? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5691.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5691.799999999999s)]

*  Are you okay? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5692.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5693.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5693.5599999999995s)]
*  That's amazing when people don't have to pee to me. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5693.879999999999s)]
*  What, um, so everything was going, so your, so your career was going great. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5697.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5702.08s)]
*  And then you had this, you had the instance that happened with the, uh, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5702.759999999999s)]
*  allegations, right? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5708.639999999999s)]
*  Is that the best way to say it? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5709.56s)]
*  How do people? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5710.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5711.68s)]
*  I mean, there's allegations against me, stuff I didn't do, but Dick gets out in [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5712.080000000001s)]
*  social media, the media writes about it. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5718.4400000000005s)]
*  And, uh, to be fair, like they were very serious allegations. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5720.400000000001s)]
*  Like what was alleged was very, you know, should be investigated and should [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5724.4800000000005s)]
*  be taken very seriously. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5727.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, just the, you know, the way the system works, it's like, those get, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5729.280000000001s)]
*  those allegations get made. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5733.64s)]
*  There's an open investigation, you know, I'm advised not to say anything. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5734.8s)]
*  So it's only, it's a very one-sided discussion for a long period of time. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5738.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5743.04s)]
*  And then that influences public perception over it. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5743.4400000000005s)]
*  And then when the facts start coming out, when the truth starts coming out, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5745.84s)]
*  it's a much smaller, uh, there's, there's a lot less buzz around it. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5749.08s)]
*  And so the public perception has already been influenced in a certain way. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5755.32s)]
*  It must've been harrowing to go through. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5759.04s)]
*  Yeah, it sucked. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5761.36s)]
*  It sucked. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5763.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, it still sucks. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5764.28s)]
*  Um, but, uh, um, so, and it doesn't even sound like it was that it sounds [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5766.4400000000005s)]
*  like there was just, you messaged with a woman online, you guys both agree [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5775.16s)]
*  to spend time together, you spend time together. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5779.04s)]
*  Um, it's later revealed that she had the idea that she wanted to, she had a plan [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5782.56s)]
*  or a strategy to, um, did it say like, to take from you? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5792.12s)]
*  I'm trying to think what the strategy was. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5800.44s)]
*  There's, there's texts about, you know, taking my money, um, getting in. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5802.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5809.5199999999995s)]
*  Stuff like that. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5809.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5810.72s)]
*  Next victim, star picture for the Dodgers. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5810.96s)]
*  Um, and what's so crazy is Trevor is I was like three months ago, I'm [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5813.32s)]
*  looking at some stuff online and I'm okay talking with you about this. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5818.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5820.76s)]
*  Do you feel okay? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5821.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5821.5599999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5821.88s)]
*  Um, I'm looking at some stuff online. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5822.68s)]
*  I see pictures of the girl and I'm like, how do I know this girl? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5824.8s)]
*  I had, she had connected with me over social media at some point. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5828.6s)]
*  Um, and we met up, she came to a comedy show and then she came afterwards. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5833.92s)]
*  We went to my hotel, we just sat in the lobby and chatted and, uh, she like knew [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5839.52s)]
*  some friends, we had some mutual friends and stuff and, um, but we just sat there [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5844.4800000000005s)]
*  and chatted and then I got her an Uber home. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5848.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5850.2s)]
*  Um, thank goodness, I guess, cause you know, but, but that, it just blew. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5850.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, look at it. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5856.2s)]
*  I'm like, how do I, but even that to me, cause I know she, I felt like she wanted [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5856.839999999999s)]
*  to stay over and spend time, you know, it just blew my mind. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5860.719999999999s)]
*  I'm like, is this, is this like a thing? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5865.12s)]
*  Like, was this person like doing this kind of stuff regularly or was it [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5868.2s)]
*  a just happenstance that, you know, anyway, it just that, and that got me [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5871.799999999999s)]
*  even more into your world kind of, and, uh, and I really started to look back [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5876.16s)]
*  at what had gone on and, and man, it was just, I think a lot of people felt [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5879.6s)]
*  like it was just a really raw deal. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5884.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5886.8s)]
*  I mean, I certainly feel that way. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5887.76s)]
*  Um, I can't change it obviously at this point, like it, it is what it is. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5889.200000000001s)]
*  Like the situation happened. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5895.56s)]
*  Um, I've had to, I've had to do like two, like two main things. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5897.76s)]
*  One, I've had to like self reflect. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5906.88s)]
*  How did I get into this situation where like something like this is even possible? [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5914.24s)]
*  And then two, I've had to look towards the future and try to have something [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5915.12s)]
*  that I'm moving towards or something that I'm trying to accomplish, because [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5918.56s)]
*  if I don't, I would just get mired in this really negative stuff. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5922.84s)]
*  Um, and that's, you know, it's not good for mental health. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5928.36s)]
*  It's not good for productivity or the people that I'm around or, you know, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5931.6s)]
*  stuff like that. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5936.160000000001s)]
*  So I've done a lot of reflecting and like looking at mistakes that I made. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5936.92s)]
*  And, um, in a lot of that, like, there's a lot of components to this whole [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5942.56s)]
*  situation, like number one, like my interactions with, uh, females in general. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5949.56s)]
*  Like I paid very little attention to my personal life because I was so focused [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5956.96s)]
*  on baseball and then when I started my businesses, it was baseball and business. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5963.16s)]
*  And I just didn't pay attention to anything else. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5966.84s)]
*  So I had just like, I didn't think any of it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5969.32s)]
*  Someone would hit me up on Instagram and like, oh yeah, yeah, let's go over [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5971.84s)]
*  and do whatever. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5975.68s)]
*  I didn't think anything of it. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5976.44s)]
*  I think it at the time it was like, well, I treat people well and I'm respectful [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5978.5599999999995s)]
*  and like, I don't, I'm not doing anything improper. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5983.48s)]
*  And so like that's fine. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5986.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5989.24s)]
*  That's a way to live. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5989.4s)]
*  I'm living the way you're supposed to be living. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5990.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5991.92s)]
*  And it never even crossed my mind that something like this could happen. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5992.32s)]
*  Um, but, you know, I was associating with people that were not, that didn't see the. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=5995.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6002.32s)]
*  People were like hitting me up on Instagram because they knew me somehow, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6002.679999999999s)]
*  but I didn't know them. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6006.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6007.16s)]
*  I, you know, I would just meet up with them. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6007.44s)]
*  I knew very little about them. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6008.88s)]
*  Um, that was dangerous in my position. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6010.36s)]
*  Part of like what we discussed about the software update, like I see myself as [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6012.12s)]
*  this, this guy that's like even with everybody else, it's just, you know, and [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6016.2s)]
*  then I get into a position in life where that's not the case and I become a [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6020.56s)]
*  target and I just didn't see like the signs of being a target or whatever. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6025.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I didn't update my software early enough. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6029.52s)]
*  And it's a bummer. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6032.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6033.84s)]
*  It's a bummer because you also, you want to be able to meet people on even terms. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6034.400000000001s)]
*  That's the toughest thing about sometimes having some popularity, I think. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6037.56s)]
*  And something it's sometimes kind of like, I don't want to say sad because [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6040.4400000000005s)]
*  nobody's like, Hey, look, man, you get to have a lot of neat do a lot of. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6044.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6047.320000000001s)]
*  I don't, I don't ever want to come off like a victim. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6047.64s)]
*  Like it was like I was treated this way or whatever. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6049.72s)]
*  It's just like, there are realities to the certain situations and definitely [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6053.04s)]
*  very, very positive, like being a professional athlete and like having that [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6058.0s)]
*  opportunity, like there's so many positives to it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6061.72s)]
*  Um, I don't ever want to come off like I'm complaining, but there are certain [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6064.280000000001s)]
*  realities that go along with it that you have to be cognizant of. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6068.68s)]
*  And, um, yeah, I just, I didn't update quick enough to be cognizant of them [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6072.04s)]
*  before it happened. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6077.76s)]
*  I've updated now. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6078.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6079.400000000001s)]
*  I've changed a lot of things, how I do things in my personal life. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6079.64s)]
*  Like, I'm very careful of who I meet and how I meet them. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6083.96s)]
*  Um, you know, I'm not having the same type of just casual sexual relationships. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6087.92s)]
*  So I'm not agreeing to do the same types of like sexual things. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6092.160000000001s)]
*  Um, I'm not like dating a bunch of people. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6095.92s)]
*  I've like really locked down my personal life and gone back to the square one. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6098.8s)]

*  looked into them thoroughly and I respect the hell out of the police for doing that. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6355.799999999999s)]

*  So I'm just in this holding pattern. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6381.839999999999s)]
*  And then there was MLB suspended me and then there was, you know, we, um, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6384.2s)]

*  how long that took another period of time. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6396.0s)]
*  Um, things move slowly in the, you know, as they go through courts and as they [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6399.16s)]
*  go through, uh, arbitrations and stuff like that. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6403.5599999999995s)]

*  So I don't want this to come off as like, I am advocating for one thing or another, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6553.68s)]
*  but it seems like there's this loophole having been through it where like, you [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6558.92s)]
*  can make a domestic violence, uh, restraining order requests you can file [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6564.04s)]
*  for, for one of those, and you can write a whole bunch of stuff and that's fine. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6568.52s)]
*  Cause you have to be able to write what happened and make your claim. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6573.36s)]
*  And then that is filed. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6576.839999999999s)]
*  That becomes a public document. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6579.24s)]
*  You don't have to attach your name to it, but you can attach [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6581.4s)]
*  the other person's name to it. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6585.16s)]
*  And then it takes time for that to go through, to get scheduled, to [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6586.96s)]
*  get heard, to get decided upon. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6591.28s)]
*  But the damage in today's society has already been done as soon as that becomes [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6594.799999999999s)]
*  public that like, you know, we, we went to the domestic violence restraining [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6599.88s)]
*  order court, which is like the lowest standard of proof that you have to, in [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6605.76s)]
*  order to get that to, to win a domestic violence restraining order, like it's [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6611.12s)]
*  the lowest standard of proof. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6614.88s)]
*  We went to that and won. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6616.4400000000005s)]
*  Like there was no restraining order granted, but in the month or I think it [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6618.4800000000005s)]
*  was actually like a month, I think it was like six weeks in between when the [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6624.12s)]
*  initial filing and articles came out. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6627.64s)]
*  And when that happened, that's six weeks of one side of the story being out there. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6629.6s)]
*  And like the damage is done. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6634.52s)]
*  I can't say anything. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6635.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6637.52s)]
*  And I've had great legal representation and they've advised me well along the way. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6637.8s)]
*  And the advice is don't say anything. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6641.400000000001s)]
*  And it kills me because like, I want to defend myself. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6643.4400000000005s)]
*  I want to get the truth out there. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6646.360000000001s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, well, what is the, what's the reparation for the [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6648.52s)]
*  damage that's been done here? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6651.76s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like there's any sort of, yeah. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6652.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6655.92s)]
*  And maybe there's, maybe there's some sort of update that can be made to the, to [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6656.2s)]
*  that process. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6661.0s)]
*  Like I also see the other side of it where, you know, for people that are in those [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6661.8s)]
*  situations that need a place to be able to go and like get help and to get out of [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6666.16s)]
*  a bad situation and to protect themselves. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6671.48s)]
*  Like we never want to discourage that from happening either. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6673.48s)]
*  No, I don't know what the solution is here, but just like having talked to people [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6677.2s)]
*  in professional sports and like a lot of people have reached out and like, Hey [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6681.96s)]
*  man, I went through something similar. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6685.68s)]
*  This is what they did to me, or this is what happened in my case, or this was, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6686.92s)]
*  seemingly was helpful or whatever. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6690.0s)]
*  Like this is a thing that happens a lot. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6692.12s)]
*  Again, I don't, I just know what happened with me. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6695.240000000001s)]
*  And just from what I've been told, right. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6697.56s)]
*  This is your instance. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6699.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6700.04s)]
*  It's, you know, the general way is like you make these allegations and then tell [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6700.320000000001s)]
*  the person you're going to file this thing and in order, and they, you know, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6709.8s)]
*  the implications can be very bad for you. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6713.08s)]
*  And so then money exchanges hands and I've talked to multiple people [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6715.04s)]
*  where that's been the case. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6718.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6719.92s)]
*  So it's just like, uh, people can do that and threat and make, and then [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6720.16s)]
*  you have to pay to get rid of it. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6723.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6725.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6726.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6728.0s)]
*  I, you know, I don't know how they update it and it's tough that they don't have [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6728.4s)]
*  to attach their name to it because then there's no real repercussions for them. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6731.36s)]
*  You know? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6734.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6735.0s)]
*  Um, I'm sorry you had to go through that man. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6735.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6738.04s)]
*  You know, I know that doesn't help or anything, but I think a lot of [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6738.36s)]
*  people probably feel that way. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6740.68s)]
*  We all have our struggles and I don't like, I'm very fortunate [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6741.88s)]
*  to be in the position I am even with all this stuff. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6744.92s)]
*  Like I'm not blind to that. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6747.28s)]
*  And so, again, I don't want to, I never want to come off as like, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6749.04s)]
*  Oh, what was me? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6752.12s)]
*  And like, I was victim or anything like that. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6753.12s)]
*  I mean, I believe that you were a victim there and I'll just say that for myself, [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6755.56s)]
*  but I don't think you sound like that at all. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6758.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6760.8s)]
*  Um, it was a tough situation. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6761.36s)]
*  We all have tough situations in life and like, hopefully something that I say [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6763.68s)]
*  about how I got through it or how I am trying to like learn from past mistakes [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6769.16s)]
*  and be better is helpful to the next person that goes through it. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6773.96s)]
*  So it makes their time a little bit easier than my time was. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6777.88s)]
*  Well, that's, that's thoughtful of you. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6781.28s)]
*  It's kind of a powerful to get to that place. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6782.68s)]
*  I'm sure it's been an interesting journey, you know? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6785.28s)]
*  It's been interesting. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6790.12s)]
*  I think in like 10 years, when I look back on it, I'll be, um, I think there'll [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6791.52s)]
*  be a lot of things in my life that have happened because of changes that I made [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6796.84s)]
*  during this time period that I'll be very happy with. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6803.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6805.88s)]
*  Um, it's just very hard to like see off into the future when you're so in it. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6806.56s)]
*  And when you feel like, you know, you're everything you knew about [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6812.2s)]
*  your world is completely like gone. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6816.68s)]
*  Like you're basically just torn down to zero. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6819.72s)]
*  Like, where do I go from here? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6821.96s)]
*  What am I doing? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6823.2s)]
*  Um, but as far as like updating the software and stuff, I think I'll be [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6824.96s)]
*  happy in, in five or 10 years that like changes that I've made because of this [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6829.08s)]
*  experience, um, have helped me like grow as a person. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6833.4s)]
*  Fuck dude. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6838.36s)]
*  You're fucking in. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6839.4s)]
*  It's a, it is a high road attitude, um, to hear from you. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6841.0s)]
*  For me, like I can't, I can't go any other road because it'll just, it's poisonous. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6849.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6856.48s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6856.84s)]
*  So what's next then? [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6858.4s)]
*  What's next? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6860.16s)]
*  How do we get to see you? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6861.24s)]
*  Cause I want to see you go for that second side. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6862.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6864.96s)]
*  I'm going to be really, really honest with you. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6865.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6867.12s)]
*  I mean, that's the goal. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6868.08s)]
*  Like I'd like to play, uh, in MLB. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6868.96s)]
*  Um, you know, looking for, looking for a contract and, um, yeah, I mean, I still, [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6871.36s)]
*  I've, I've been training the whole time. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6878.64s)]
*  Like we talked earlier about how baseball is like my backdrop. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6880.04s)]
*  Like when things go bad, I go back to this. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6882.92s)]
*  And this has been one of the most difficult things is like when baseball [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6885.36s)]
*  is taken away, like, what do I fall back on? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6889.16s)]
*  So I just fell back on training. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6891.16s)]
*  So I'm in, you know, I I've improved like since last people last saw me, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6892.96s)]
*  like I'm throwing harder. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6899.88s)]
*  I've developed new pitches, my commands better. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6902.12s)]
*  I'm still one of the best pitchers in the world. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6904.8s)]
*  Um, I'd love to prove that obviously I realized there's a lot of, uh, you [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6907.04s)]
*  know, other considerations besides just talent, um, at this point. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6912.639999999999s)]
*  So I'm hopeful that I get a job and I get an opportunity to go out and, and [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6916.24s)]
*  prove that I'm good and I have a lot to offer. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6920.12s)]
*  I think I got a lot to offer the baseball community as a whole with content, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6922.2s)]
*  entertainment, and all that. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6926.32s)]
*  I have a lot to offer a team. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6928.36s)]
*  Like one of the things I'm really passionate about is helping young [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6929.48s)]
*  baseball players have their journey be easier than mine. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6933.12s)]
*  So we actually train, I think we got like 20 guys that we train for free at my [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6936.16s)]
*  facility in Arizona and the off season pro guys that come in. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6940.36s)]
*  I've been working with all the pitchers there and developing pitches and feel [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6944.360000000001s)]
*  and mindset and all that stuff. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6947.72s)]
*  I love that stuff. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6948.8s)]
*  So I have a lot to offer from that perspective, I think to a team and [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6949.72s)]
*  clubhouse that I'm with, um, obviously like performance, like you got to win [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6953.64s)]
*  games, I know I can do that. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6957.88s)]
*  That's not even a question in my mind. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6959.360000000001s)]
*  So what was like the financial cause you were making good money. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6960.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6964.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6965.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6965.8s)]
*  I signed, um, so I won the Cy Young 2020 and then that was your contract year. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6966.12s)]
*  I was a free agent after that. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6972.240000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6973.759999999999s)]
*  That is a dream. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6976.04s)]
*  Very fortunate. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6977.5599999999995s)]
*  And look, I love it when dudes get paid. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6978.08s)]
*  That's what George Kittle told me. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6979.5599999999995s)]
*  He goes where everybody's happy when somebody gets paid, man. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6980.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6983.839999999999s)]
*  Three years, 102 million. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6985.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6987.28s)]
*  So the, it was a kind of a unique structure. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6988.48s)]
*  The plan I had opt outs after every year, the plan was always to the [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6990.48s)]
*  first play the first two years and then opt out and be a free agent after the [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6993.96s)]
*  third, and I would have been two years for 85 million the way the contract worked out. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=6997.44s)]
*  So an average value of 42 and a half million a year, which was the highest [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7001.56s)]
*  annual average value at that time for any baseball player, I think Shohei just crushed. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7006.68s)]
*  No way. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7011.72s)]
*  So you were like the top of the heap. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7012.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7014.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7015.080000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7015.360000000001s)]
*  And did they still have to pay you a certain amount of that? [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7015.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7018.400000000001s)]
*  Um, I got some of it. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7018.88s)]
*  I also lost some of it in the, you know, I think, um, I don't remember exactly [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7020.400000000001s)]
*  what the numbers shook out to be, but I lost a significant amount of it with the [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7025.92s)]
*  suspension and stuff like that. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7029.0s)]
*  So, and was it expensive, like the lawyer attorney fees and all that? [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7030.28s)]
*  Yeah, man, lawyers are, uh, very much needed, like very specialized and like, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7034.08s)]
*  you know, you need, you need them, but, um, very expensive. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7040.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7043.639999999999s)]
*  So it's been, um, obviously baseball has given me a lot financially. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7043.92s)]
*  Um, I'm doing fine. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7050.12s)]
*  I don't want to come off like I'm, you know, not fine, but, uh, it's been a [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7051.32s)]
*  heavy, a heavy hit for sure. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7055.84s)]
*  Um, and how do your agents, like, do you try to go back at the same rate? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7059.2s)]
*  Like, how does that even work? [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7063.4s)]
*  Is that fair to ask you about? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7064.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7065.52s)]
*  I can ask you about. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7065.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's fine. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7066.4s)]
*  Um, I don't like, I just want to play. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7067.52s)]
*  Like that's, that's where I'm at. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7070.84s)]
*  Um, like I I'll play for league minimum and like earn my money based in incentives. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7072.32s)]
*  Like I don't care. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7078.4s)]
*  Whatever, whatever the structure for the team is, like that makes them most [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7079.4800000000005s)]
*  comfortable, like it's fine with me. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7085.68s)]
*  You heard it. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7088.36s)]
*  I just want to go play. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7089.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7090.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7091.6s)]
*  Incentive based, right? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7091.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7093.16s)]
*  You want to, you, I'll show you. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7093.52s)]
*  If, yeah, if you sign me and like something's not going right and you don't like the [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7095.0s)]
*  reaction or you don't whatever, like you can cut me and then you don't have to [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7099.52s)]
*  bear the, um, you know, the brunt of signing this, let's say it's a $10 million [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7103.68s)]
*  contract and you know, something's not going right and you still have to pay [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7109.24s)]
*  the 10 million. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7112.04s)]
*  I don't, I don't need that. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7112.6s)]
*  Like I just want to, I want a job. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7114.52s)]
*  I want to go play and let me just prove that I'm still one of the best pitchers. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7116.24s)]
*  Let me prove that I have a lot to offer the organization and then I'll get paid [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7120.12s)]
*  in incentives I'll earn based on what I perform. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7124.76s)]
*  I'm happy with that. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7128.44s)]
*  Um, I've never, like, I've always wanted to be that way too. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7129.5199999999995s)]
*  Like it's, I've, I've only wanted to sign one year contracts because I never [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7136.0s)]
*  want to be the guy that signs a long-term deal and then it's like, okay, well, I'm [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7139.32s)]
*  getting paid regardless, so performance doesn't matter and I'm just going to [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7143.84s)]
*  like play out my years or whatever. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7147.96s)]
*  I'm just going to get massages or whatever, paint my nails or whatever. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7149.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7152.360000000001s)]
*  Like shout out to the guys that paint their nails. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7153.0s)]
*  No problem with it, but like, I, I'm an intense competitor and I just want to go [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7154.84s)]
*  compete and like, I would like to be compensated fairly for what I produce. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7162.84s)]
*  So if I produce nothing, I don't feel like I should be compensated anything. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7167.32s)]
*  If I'm the best pitcher in the league, I feel like I should be compensated for [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7171.4s)]
*  being the best pitcher in the league. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7174.32s)]
*  And the easiest way to do that is just like minimum risk for the team. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7175.96s)]
*  I'll play for the minimum. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7179.96s)]
*  And then if I pitch really well, then have incentives that reward me for pitching [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7181.04s)]
*  really well and the value that I give to the team is equally shared and both [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7185.0s)]
*  sides feel like they want. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7190.16s)]
*  Um, I'm happy to have any sort of like, like, yeah, I want to work together with [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7191.48s)]
*  the team. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7199.56s)]
*  I want to be a positive in the community, in the clubhouse, on the field, like [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7199.96s)]
*  overall for the game of baseball. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7203.160000000001s)]
*  Um, I know that I can be that I have no questions about it, which is why I have [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7204.84s)]
*  no problem taking like a incentive based contract because I know that I can go [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7208.88s)]
*  out there and deliver, um, I know the type of person that I am. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7213.96s)]
*  I know the type of results that I'm be able to produce and I'm willing to [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7218.160000000001s)]
*  bet on myself in that way. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7221.400000000001s)]
*  But at the, at the end of the day, like, I just, I just want to compete. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7222.88s)]
*  Like, I just want a chance to go compete and like, do the thing that I've spent [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7228.44s)]
*  30 years becoming one of the best in the world at, and the thing that I love to do. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7233.2s)]
*  Um, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7238.84s)]
*  bro, I w if I had a team, if I had even, if we had a spot here, I'd hire you right [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7239.5199999999995s)]
*  now, I'd hire you to pitch. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7244.5199999999995s)]
*  What would you, what would you call it? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7246.16s)]
*  What's your, what'd your team name be? [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7247.08s)]
*  Ooh, that's a great question. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7249.0s)]
*  Uh, put you on the spot. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7250.44s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7252.28s)]
*  What's a good team name? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7253.8s)]
*  Probably maybe, uh, the reverb or the lisp. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7254.96s)]
*  The lisp. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7259.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7260.6s)]
*  One of my best friends growing up, Douglas had a lisp and I would always, um, I would [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7261.56s)]
*  impersonate him because I was in, it was like the, he had the unique voice. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7265.76s)]
*  It's one of the teachers. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7269.76s)]
*  One time I thought I was making fun of him. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7270.88s)]
*  I'm like, what do you mean? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7271.88s)]
*  I'm not, he's like, he, God put that remix in him. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7273.36s)]
*  Like he's doing something different. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7276.88s)]
*  Like I just thought it was so cool, you know, so the list is going to be kind of [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7278.64s)]
*  cool. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7283.08s)]
*  Cause it's like taking something that can be considered to kind of like, maybe not [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7283.4s)]
*  the best, but making it positive. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7287.08s)]
*  It can be pretty dope. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7288.44s)]
*  What else? [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7289.36s)]
*  The Nashville lisp. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7289.76s)]
*  Ooh, it's got a ring. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7291.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7292.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7297.24s)]
*  Thrike. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7298.2s)]
*  I sounded like Howie Mandel saying that joke. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7300.76s)]
*  Um, but dude, well, if we could, if we could afford you even at basic minimum, we'd [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7302.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7661.68s)]
*  Um, but yeah, man, I, yeah, it's, I think, because if you, if there was no, there was [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7662.2s)]
*  no criminal wrongdoing, there was nothing wrong. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7667.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7670.16s)]
*  There was nothing wrong. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7670.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7671.8s)]
*  Um, you can find things that if you look at yourself, yes, I could adjust some of [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7672.28s)]
*  these behaviors and stuff, but as a human being behaving in the world to not have [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7676.52s)]
*  done anything wrong and to have, it's really just a trial that you've been through. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7681.28s)]
*  It's almost like a fucking Scarlet letter. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7687.32s)]
*  You know, it was like a Scarlet letter. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7690.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7692.04s)]
*  In a way, you know? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7692.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7693.52s)]
*  You get branded with something and then you carry it. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7693.64s)]
*  I'll carry it the rest of my life. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7695.8s)]
*  Like I'll always be known for this in some way, and hopefully over time it'll be [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7697.4s)]
*  less and all the positive things that I do will get more attention and be more [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7703.36s)]
*  synonymous with my brand, but like this will always be there, um, which is, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7708.24s)]
*  which is tough. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7713.08s)]
*  It's tough to, I can't even imagine. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7713.8s)]
*  I can't think about it too much, you know? [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7715.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7716.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7718.04s)]
*  Because it's just such a, it's such an anomaly. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7718.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7722.04s)]
*  You know? [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7722.68s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7723.4s)]
*  So we got to get you, we got to, we don't have to do any, I can't do shit, but it'd [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7724.64s)]
*  be awesome. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7728.08s)]

*  They got Darvish. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7738.48s)]

*  Who was it? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7746.64s)]
*  They got, uh, who the? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7747.88s)]
*  Harbaugh. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7750.24s)]
*  The charges that Harbaugh, yeah, from Michigan. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7751.2s)]
*  They got Harbaugh. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7753.320000000001s)]
*  He might come out to a game. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7754.0s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7755.2s)]
*  Go blue. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7757.12s)]
*  I got some, I got some friends that are big Michigan fans. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7758.280000000001s)]
*  So, yeah. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7760.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, they were all those people were so geeked recently. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7761.320000000001s)]
*  They had a crazy season. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7765.12s)]
*  All the adversity they went through as a team. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7766.08s)]
*  Like, it's crazy when you watch that and you're like, okay, like adversity either [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7768.08s)]
*  tears you apart or makes you so much stronger. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7772.320000000001s)]
*  Like they really came together and they put a, they put together a hell of a run. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7774.4800000000005s)]
*  What do you say? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7779.280000000001s)]
*  Like, what do you, what are your thoughts? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7779.96s)]
*  Cause you're almost relatable to like, I mean, it's very scary. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7780.92s)]
*  Like any, somebody being like in any sort of like a public persona or something, or [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7786.52s)]
*  popularity, it's very scary. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7792.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7794.8s)]
*  Um, man, God, it's just, but there's probably guys who are imprisoned right [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7795.4s)]
*  now for things that they didn't do. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7800.2s)]
*  For sure. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7802.12s)]
*  Like, I try to keep that perspective and like, yeah, this has sucked. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7803.08s)]
*  I'm not trying to belittle what you went through. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7809.08s)]
*  It could be way worse. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7810.4s)]
*  What, what, but you're a person who was able to set goals and set and really get [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7811.76s)]
*  through like some of the tougher parts of life by your own manifestations and. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7817.24s)]
*  Game planning. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7826.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7827.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7827.96s)]
*  It seems like in your life, how do you, like, what did you do? [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7828.2s)]
*  And cause I'm sure there are guys sitting in a cell right now who can, might be [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7833.32s)]
*  able to learn some stuff. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7838.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7840.0s)]
*  I think one of the biggest things is talking about it. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7841.08s)]
*  And that was one of the toughest things that I couldn't talk about it publicly. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7843.8s)]
*  So having a, having someone privately that you could just talk to about it to at [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7846.76s)]
*  least hear yourself vocalize what you're feeling. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7853.0s)]
*  Like I, if I didn't have someone to talk to, I would not have, I would not [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7856.2s)]
*  have made it through this. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7862.24s)]
*  Um, that's a huge thing. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7863.76s)]
*  Like it's scary to talk about things a lot of times and to like be viewed as [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7865.88s)]
*  vulnerable or to be viewed, you know, you don't know how the other person's going [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7871.32s)]
*  to view your perspective, but it's so important. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7874.36s)]
*  Uh, so I'd say first thing, like find someone to talk to, whether it's a [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7877.16s)]
*  therapist, whether it's a friend, a family member, you know, I don't know. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7880.64s)]
*  A lot of people aren't fortunate enough to have family members around to talk to [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7883.4400000000005s)]
*  her. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7886.56s)]
*  They don't have those relationships, but find someone that you can talk to. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7886.6s)]
*  Um, and be honest with. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7890.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7893.28s)]
*  Like be able to just tell it how you're feeling it. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7894.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7898.12s)]
*  Be honest about how you're feeling. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7898.320000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7899.68s)]
*  Um, that's, that's the biggest thing I'd say. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7900.68s)]
*  And then having something, some goal, like humans need a purpose. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7903.76s)]
*  Like we don't do well when we're like just existing for, we don't have anything [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7908.8s)]
*  to do. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7914.76s)]
*  And if you can find some purpose that's controllable, they're like, you know, for [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7916.08s)]
*  me, it was business. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7921.4800000000005s)]
*  Like I had a business. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7922.4s)]
*  So I woke up in the morning. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7923.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, okay, how do we get this thing firing or how do we get, uh, make a [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7925.04s)]
*  better video or how do we edit this way? [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7930.12s)]
*  Or, okay, I gotta figure out the, you know, what higher do we need to make? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7931.84s)]
*  So there was something that I was in control of that I was actively doing [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7935.36s)]
*  that I could distract myself in a way from the negative stuff and like focus on [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7940.2s)]
*  something that was like aspirational, like, okay, in the future when all this [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7944.84s)]
*  stuff is done, cause it's going to be done at some point. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7949.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7952.08s)]
*  Maybe a day, it might be a year, it might be 10 years. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7952.32s)]
*  It's not going to last forever. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7955.24s)]
*  So at some point in the future, when it's done, what is it that I have that I've [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7957.32s)]
*  been building that I can like aspire? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7962.5199999999995s)]
*  What position do I want to be when this is done? [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7964.48s)]
*  Like, and can I make progress towards that? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7968.28s)]
*  Like that's how I was like talking about it and having some sort of aspirational [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7970.4s)]
*  goal that I was chasing. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7974.0s)]
*  Um, but yeah, the support group is, is so big, man. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7976.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7981.0s)]
*  Like just being able to vocalize your feelings is important. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7981.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7986.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7987.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7988.5199999999995s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7990.24s)]
*  I mean, fortunately and unfortunately, but some of those moments are the best [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7991.04s)]
*  moments of my life, you know, dealing with addiction and learning about [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7995.0s)]
*  recovery and stuff, um, it's given me some of the greatest gifts in my life, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=7997.719999999999s)]
*  which are great conversations with people and learning how to be around people [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8003.44s)]
*  when, and feel and have, and stuff like that. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8006.32s)]
*  So I think the humans learn by failing first and then adjusting behavior and [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8010.32s)]
*  then growing, and it's a sense of pride to be able to feel like you've gotten [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8017.799999999999s)]
*  better at something or you're a, in a better place or a better person because [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8023.04s)]
*  of something, but the moments where you're failing, you know, and when you're [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8027.599999999999s)]
*  in that, like those are tough, but being able to have that comeback is so [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8032.32s)]
*  important because that's where you feel that sense of accomplishment or that [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8039.0s)]
*  sense of purpose or that, you know, whatever it is, you get something from [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8044.24s)]
*  that, if you never fail at anything, like life's just like, there's no richness [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8047.88s)]
*  to it, you know? [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8054.0s)]
*  Um, so I can definitely, I can understand how some of those moments, like you fail [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8055.76s)]
*  at something, you end up in a bad place and you find a way to like pull yourself [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8060.88s)]
*  back up and then like, feels a sense of pride. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8063.88s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8066.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8066.68s)]
*  Man, it's interesting how much you work with your own integrity and your [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8067.16s)]
*  own like setting goals for yourself. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8069.96s)]
*  And it must be, it's like you have probably a knowledge of yourself on a [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8071.96s)]
*  unique level that, that some people don't get to have, man. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8076.24s)]
*  And I think that's. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8078.64s)]
*  I think being an introvert, like I don't, I don't do well in the social [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8079.88s)]
*  situations like we talked about. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8083.84s)]
*  So I spend a lot of time thinking and a lot of it's about external stuff, but I [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8085.36s)]
*  try to think internally too, and, um, try to figure out why a lot of time, like, [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8091.64s)]
*  okay, I did this thing. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8097.8s)]
*  Like, why did I do that? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8099.360000000001s)]
*  What prompted me to react this way emotionally to this situation or what [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8100.400000000001s)]
*  prompted me to go want to do like, why do I like cars or what, what is it? [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8103.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8107.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xszRKZmah8Y&t=8107.88s)]
